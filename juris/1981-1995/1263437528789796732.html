				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This decision deals with two (2) special civil actions,
separately filed and docketed as G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
They have been consolidated and are here jointly decided because they involve
one and the same Torrens title:  Transfer Certificate of Title No. 124088, reconstituted in the name of
Dolores V. Molina.  The land covered by
said title overlaps that embraced in other titles issued to Ortigas and
Company, Ltd. and subsequently transferred by it to other persons.  More specifically, the property covered by
Molina's reconstituted title is described by the petitioner as "a
13-hectare prime residential land, within (its) fully developed Greenmeadows
Subdivision, ** situated between the plush residential subdivisions of
Corinthian Gardens and the Millionaires' Row of the Greenmeadows subdivision in
Quezon City ** ."</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue centers chiefly on the validity of the judgment of the
respondent Trial Judge reconstituting said TCT No. 124088 in favor of Dolores
V. Molina despite objections, among others, that there was a lack of actual
notice to the adjacent owners, and that the land therein described is already
covered by other Torrens titles earlier issued and accorded judicial
recognition by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 109645 originated from a petition filed on November 14,
1991 with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by Dolores V. Molina, praying
for the reconstitution of her Transfer Certificate of Title No. 124088.  The case was docketed as LRC Case No.
Q-5404.  In the petition, she alleged
that the original copy of the title on file with the Quezon City Register of
Deeds was lost during the fire that gutted said Office on June 11, 1988; that
she was however in actual custody of the owner's duplicate copy of the title
(i.e., the title "has been and still is in ** (her) possession"); and
that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or
encumbrance on the land therein described.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 29, 1991 Molina moved for permission to withdraw her
petition, stating that it had become necessary for her to go to the United
States for some ten (10) months, to attend to her property in Los Angeles and
San Francisco.  The respondent Judge,
Hon. Tirso Velasco, forthwith issued an order granting the motion; the case was
dismissed, the petition being considered withdrawn.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Four months later, however, or on or about April 3, 1992, Molina
filed an <i>ex parte</i> motion for "revival" of LRC Case No. Q-5404
and admission of an amended petition for reconstitution of her title.   In the "affidavit of loss" appended
to her amended petition, dated March 31, 1992, Dolores Molina averred that the
owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088 which, in her original petition of
November 14, 1991, she claimed "has been and still is in ** (her)
possession," was missing -- a fact she discovered in "the middle part
of September, 1991" -- and that, since said owner's duplicate could no
longer be found despite diligent efforts to locate it, she had secured a
certification from the Land Management Bureau to the effect that there is
"a record of ** (her) property in a microfilm negative."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By Order dated April 3, 1992, Judge Velasco reinstated the
(original, withdrawn) petition and admitted the amended petition, giving it
"due course." In a separate Order of the same date, His Honor
declared the amended petition sufficient in form and substance, and set it for
hearing on June 29, 1992.  He also
directed that the Bureau of Land Management and the Land Registration Authority
be given copies of the amended petition for their verification, comment, report
and recommendation; that the amended petition be published in the Official
Gazette; and that the Solicitor General and the Register of Deeds of Quezon
City be furnished with copies of the order.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Solicitor General<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General's Office objected to the petition on the
ground among others that no actual notice had been given to the adjacent
owners.  This resulted in the Court's
acknowledgment, in its Order of July 3, 1992, of its inability to “declare as
of now that it had already acquired jurisdiction over ** (the) case considering
the manifestation of ** (Solicitor) Ma. Eloisa Castro that the requirement of
notice to the other adjacent owners has not as yet been submitted to the Court
altho (sic) apparently the land in question is being bounded by roads.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Molina thereupon filed an <i>ex</i> <i>parte</i> motion dated
July 13, 1992, praying that notices be served on the (a) "subject
owners" of specified lots in the corresponding "Technical Description
of the subject land;" (b) the "President of the Corinthian
Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay
Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as
Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian:" (c) the
"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner
designated as Public Land;" and (d) the "City Engineer of Quezon City

The motion was granted by Order of respondent Judge Velasco dated July 16,
1992, which also set the hearing of the case on July 20, 1992 at 2:30 o'clock
in the afternoon.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The notice of hearing, issued by the Clerk of Court under date of
July 16, 1992, was addressed to only the last three (3) parties above named, to
wit:  the "President of the
Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru
the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property
designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;"
the "Director, Bureau of Lands, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner

<p class="BODY">Ortigas &amp; Co., Ltd. allegedly learned of Molina's petition
for reconstitution by accident and filed a formal opposition thereto.  In a supplemental pleading dated July 21,
1992,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
it adverted to "a proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the
destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of
Deeds," and described Dolores Molina as "a well-known land speculator
(who) ** has filed several petitions which are glaringly contradictory to one
another (and) therefore ** perjurious." It pointed out that in Land
Registration Case No. Q-336 entitled "<i>Widows and Orphans Association,
Inc. (WIDORA) - Applicant, LRC Record No. N-50589</i>," for instance,
Molina had filed an Opposition on <u>August 25, 1978</u> claiming ownership
over the property subject of the reconstitution case on the basis of "open
public, adverse against the whole world, continuous and uninterrupted
possession (thereof) for more than thirty (30) years or since time immemorial
thru herself, her tenants or predecessors-in-interest under claim of
ownership;" said claim of Molina, of dominion gained through acquisitive
prescription, was contradictory of her claim in a complaint earlier filed by
her on <u>February 22, 1990</u> -- with the same Quezon City RTC branch (No.
88) having cognizance of the reconstitution case -- docketed as Civil Case
No.90-4749 entitled "<i>Dolores V. Molina <u>v.</u> Ortigas &amp; Company,
Limited Partnership, et al</i>.," in which complaint, she alleged that
sometime in 1939 she acquired the property by purchase from Eusebia Molina and
her heirs, Avelino P. Ramos and Felix P. Micael; the deed of conveyance that
was entrusted for safekeeping to her late husband, Pio Q. Molina, having ben
lost during World War II; and she had been unable to have the property titled
because "she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family
**;" (and that in the meanwhile Ortigas succeeded in having the land
“titled in its name through deceit, fraud and misrepresentation and scheme **,”
and thereafter subdivided the same and sold the individual lots to other
persons, including Interpublic Development Corporation and Breeders Feeds
Incorporated).<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
These contradictory assertions, according to Ortigas, betrayed the "highly
suspicious and irregular" character of the Molina petition.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 15pt 49.5pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Report
of Land Registration Authority<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Ortigas' opposition also cited a report of the Land Registration
Authority to the Court <i>a quo</i> drawing attention to irregularities in the
petition, among these being:  that the
plan relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 "appears to be derived from two
different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 &amp; Psu-20191, neither of which
appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is
presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could
have emanated:" that said plan "is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which
is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC
Rec. No. N-50589," etc.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">F.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Opposition by Mormons (Manila Mission)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Molina's petition for reconstitution was also opposed by the
Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons),<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which had been apprised of LRC Case No. Q-5404 by Ortigas' counsel.  The Mormon Mission referred to the pendency
of Civil Case No. 90-4749 ("<i>Dolores V. Molina vs. Ortigas et al</i>.")
wherein it (the Mission) is one of the defendants, and to the
"contradictory circumstances" asserted by Molina in that case and in
the reconstitution proceeding, and alleged that a portion of the property claimed
by Molina was covered by its own Transfer Certificate of Title No. 348048,
involving land acquired by it in good faith and for value.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issues thus raised, hearing of the petition for
reconstitution proceeded in due course.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">G.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Testimony of Dolores Molina<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">As might be expected, Molina testified at the hearing.  Her testimony is summarized in the Velasco
decision of September 23, 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
She made no reference whatever in her testimony to the theory of prescription
as her mode of acquisition of the land in dispute.  She deposed that she and her late husband had acquired the two
(2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she
had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession;
that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the
1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and
sought the help of President Marcos who "became her boyfriend;" that
Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge
Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she
stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however,
she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President
Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was
then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the
title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title
(TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November,
1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she
learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver
and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her
the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after
Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988. </p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge Velasco rendered judgment in Molina's favor on
September 23, 1992, directing the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to
reconstitute the original copy of TCT No. 124088 in her name.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 30, 1992, the day following its receipt of Judge
Velasco's decision, Ortigas filed its notice of appeal therefrom.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
On October 6, 1992, Molina filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in
the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.  This motion Ortigas opposed in writing.  The Mormons, for their part, filed a motion
for reconsideration of the decision.  The Solicitor General also filed a notice of appeal in the Republic's
behalf.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Ortigas' Appeal, Denying Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and Authorizing
Immediate Execution<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In an Order dated October 14, 1992,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Judge Velasco passed upon these remedial steps taken by Ortigas and the
Mormons.</p>

<p class="BODY">His Honor declared that "Ortigas is * * not vested with any
justiciable interest to be a party in (the) case" because it had
admittedly "already sold all the subdivision lots which it claims to
overlap the disputed two lots (of Molina)," and Ortigas' pleadings
"failed to disclose ** any allegation about its ownership of road lots
that may overlap the land covered by the certificate of title of petitioner
sought to be reconstituted;" it was not therefore a real party in interest
since it would neither derive benefit nor suffer injury from the decision;
hence, its opposition could not be entertained and, "by force of
law," it could not also appeal the decision.  The lower court thus declared Ortigas' notice of appeal to be
"a mere scrap of paper."</p>

<p class="BODY">Said court also granted Molina's motion for immediate execution,
opining on the ostensible basis of case law, that Ortigas' appeal was
"frivolous and interposed only for purposes of delay," preclusion
thereof was justified by the need "to prevent wastage of income," or
"avoid the possibility of ** judgment becoming illusory or to minimize
damage unduly suffered by the prevailing party or to prevent further damage,"
as well as by Molina's advanced age.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same Order, Judge Velasco declared the Mormons' motion for
reconsideration -- premised on the failure of the court to acquire jurisdiction
over the case due to lack of notice -- a mere <i>pro forma</i> one, since it
posed issues already raised and considered, and any defect of notice had been
cured by the actual participation of the Mormons in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this Order, Molina succeeded in having her title (TCT
No. 124088) reconstituted; and it was assigned a new number:  TCT No. RT-58287.  Molina caused the land thereby covered to be subdivided into five
(5) parcels and obtained separate titles for them (the reconstituted title
being, of course, consequently cancelled in the process).  These titles over the five (5) subdivided
lots, TCTs Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167, were all issued in
the name of Dolores V. Molina.  Later,
TCT No. 83164 was cancelled and replaced by TCT No. 83869 in the name of
Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc. to which Molina had apparently sold the land
therein described for P24,408,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 23, 1992 the Solicitor General filed a Motion for
Reconsideration of the Order dated October 14, 1992.  The Mormons, for their part, filed a notice of appeal in respect
of which Molina filed a "Motion to Strike Out Notice of Appeal" on
December 10, 1992.</p>

Solicitor General's Appeal</i></p>

<p class="BODY">The motions were resolved by Judge Velasco in an order dated
February 10, 1993.  He denied the Mormons'
plea for reconsideration on the ground that as to them the case had become moot
and academic in light of Molina's "uncontested manifestation dated
December 22, 1992 that she has already executed <u>QUIT-CLAIM AND WAIVER</u> in
favor of the Mormons and ** the Mormons had already filed a motion withdrawing
its notice of appeal."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the Mormons Manila Mission did indeed file a
"Withdrawal of Appeal" dated December 11, 1992 because Molina had
"already recognized ** (its [the Mormons’]) ownership and possession **
over the portion covered by RT-58287 (124088) with an area of 8,860 sq. m. and
covered by TCT No. 348048 of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City," a copy
of Molina's "Quitclaim and Waiver" to this effect, dated December 18,
1992, being appended to said “Withdrawal of Appeal.”<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Judge also granted Molina's motion to strike out the
Solicitor General's notice of appeal, holding that since the Solicitor General
"has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it
introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal,"
it appearing on the contrary, that "the Land Management Bureau, the DENR,
the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are
the government agencies ** directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not
registered any opposition to the petition," the notice of appeal filed by
him was "sham" aside from being ten (10) days late.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered "to act on the notices
of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to
the Court of Appeals." It also prayed for a temporary restraining order --
which this Court granted upon a bond of P50,000.00, in a Resolution dated May
12, 1993 -- prohibiting respondent Judge from further acting upon the case and
enjoining Molina from selling, encumbering or otherwise transacting over the
land covered by her reconstituted Torrens title issued on the basis of the
questioned order of October 14, 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Origin:  Action by Manilabank for Annulment of Molina's Title<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 112564, on the other hand,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
originated from an action commenced in the Quezon City Regional Trial Court by
the Manila Banking Corporation against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises
Company, Inc.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The action was denominated one for "<i>Annulment of Transfer Certificate
of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining
Order</i>," and was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920.  It prayed for nullification of the same title
of Dolores V. Molina (TCT No. 124088) over parcels of land situated at <i>Ugong
Norte</i>, (now) Quezon City.  According
to the bank it was the owner of those parcels of land, having acquired them at
a mortgage foreclosure sale from two (2) corporations which had earlier bought
the same from Ortigas &amp; Company.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
It alleged that originally, the land formerly covered by TCTs No. 77652 and
77653 in the name of Ortigas had been converted into a large subdivision
comprising numerous lots.  A number of
these lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation
(Interpublic) and to Breeders Feeds, Inc.  The Interpublic lots were later mortgaged to Manilabank as security for
loans of Interpublic itself and of seven other persons in the total amount of
P195,985,200.00; and the lots of Breeders Feeds, Inc. were also mortgaged as
security for its own loans.  The
mortgages were foreclosed over a period of time from 1986 to 1990, and new
titles issued in favor of Manilabank as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.  Manilabank further alleged that since then,
it had paid and been paying all taxes corresponding to the property (e.g.,
transfer and real estate taxes).</p>

<p class="BODY">Molina filed a motion to dismiss this complaint, dated May 18,
1993.  She alleged several grounds:  <i>litis pendentia</i>, lack of
jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiff’s lack of status as a real party
in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.  She adverted to G.R. No. 109645 entitled <i>"Ortigas
&amp; Co. Partnership Limited v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina</i>,<i>"</i>
in which the same relief is sought, i.e., "the declaration of nullity of
the same Orders that ordered the reconstitution of Title No. 124088 of **
defendant Molina **," and in which had been issued "a restraining Order/writ
of Injunction against selling/encumbering the property covered by the said
title and those derived therefrom." It alleged that the Trial Court had no
jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate Court (reconstituting
Molina's title); that the latter orders constituted a bar to the action; and
that plaintiff Manilabank was not a party to the agreements in question.  A similar motion was filed by Molina's
co-defendant, Gateway Enterprises Co.</p>

25, 1993 Adverse to Molina<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The motions were denied for lack of merit, by Order dated
September 17, 1993.  The Court pointed
out <i>inter alia</i> that -</p>

<blockquote>" ***. The case in G.R No. 109645 involves reconstitution
while this case involves quieting of title.  The two actions are dissimilar in nature, rights and reliefs.  This case does not involve the annulment of
orders/decision of a coordinate court.  The LRC case merely directed restoration by way of reconstitution of the
titles, whereas this action is a direct attack on Molina's title, whether
reconstituted or not.  Consequently, the
order/decision in the LRC case is not a bar to this suit wherein plaintiff is a
real party in interest with a valid cause of action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Ater the filing by Molina of supplemental pleadings in support of
her original motion to dismiss, the Court reaffirmed its denial of Molina's
attempts to summarily terminate the action, by another Order dated November 25,
1993.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">C.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The Present Recourse<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Molina then filed in this Court on December 1, 1993, through
counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> dated
November 29, 1993, seeking annulment of said Orders of November 25, 1993 and
September 17, 1993 and the dismissal of the action before the Court <i>a quo</i>
upon the grounds set out in her motions to dismiss.  This was docketed as G.R. No. 112564.  At the Court's direction, comment on the petition was filed by
the respondents.  Molina's cause in this
case is in essence dependent on the validity and efficacy of the reconstituted
title she asserts over the land in dispute, TCT No 124088, which is the precise
matter in issue in G.R. No. 109645.  Hence, as announced in the opening paragraph of this opinion, the two
cases are hereby resolved jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 9, 1993, through the same lawyer, Atty. Eufracio T.
Layag, Molina filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the Court of Appeals,
also dated November 29, 1993, which is identical in every respect, in content,
allegation and prayer, to that filed in this Court on December 1, 1993.  Except for addressing itself to the Court of

perspective and thoroughly understood.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases just described -- G.R. No. 109645 (QC RTC LRC Case No.
Q-5404) and G.R. No. 112564 (QC RTC Case No. Q93-15926) -- ­are not the only

(TCT RT-58287 [formerly TCT No. 124088]), on the one hand, and Ortigas' titles
(TCTs No. 77652 and 77653), on the other.  There are others which, considered conjointly with the cases at bench,
reveal Molina's disparate efforts to assert ownership over the property and
nullify Ortigas' titles over them.</p>

<p class="BODY">One such case is that which also originated in the Quezon City
Regional Trial Court, docketed as LRC No. Q-336 and assigned by raffle to
Branch 83.  The case was one for
registration of land, instituted sometime in August of 1974 by an entity
calling itself “Widows and Orphans Association, Inc.,” or "WIDORA."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 58.3pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Dolores Molina's Claim<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In that case, Dolores Molina filed a document entitled
"Motion, Manifestations and Notice of Claim" dated August 24, 1978 as
well as a separate opposition to the application for registration.  Molina claimed ownership of 12 hectares of
the land applied for -- the same property later made subject of her
reconstitution petition -- alleging that WIDORA had executed a Deed of
Quitclaim and Assignment dated August 10, 1978 in her favor, and that in that
deed, a certain Flaviana V. Vda. de Leon, "for herself and as President of
the ** (WIDORA)" "acknowledged and recognized" the ownership of
Dolores Molina -- by acquisitive prescription, no mention being made of any
purchase by the latter -- over an unspecified portion of the land sought to be
registered with an area of twelve hectares, more or less.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
The deed also assented to Molina's intervention "as a party in
Registration Case No. Q-336 ** in order to protect her interest or claim in the
above-described property."</p>

<p class="BODY">Ortigas also opposed WIDORA's application.  It filed a motion to dismiss the proceeding
on October 24, 1978 on the ground that the land applied for was already titled
in its name, its muniments of ownership being TCTs Numbered 77652 and 77653.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the Regional Trial Court eventually rejected Ortigas'
claim by Order dated March 30, 1988, holding that said TCTs Numbered 77652 and
77653 were null and void because not derived from any decree of registration;
and that Molina was the lawful owner of the area of 12 to 14 hectares claimed
by her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration having been denied by Order May
19, 1989, Ortigas went up to the Court of Appeals on <i>certiorari</i>, its
action being docketed as CA G.R. SP No. 18085, praying for the setting aside of
the Orders of March 30, 1988 and May 19, 1989, and for the dismissal of the
registration case.  The Appellate Court
granted the writ prayed for.  In its
decision promulgated on November 27, 1989, it declared that the decree
recognizing Ortigas' ownership of the lands embraced in its titles (TCTs No.
77652 and 77653) was binding against the whole world and constituted <i>res
judicata</i>.  It categorically ruled
that<i>"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands
which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas</i>.<i>"</i></p>

<p class="BODY">WIDORA appealed to the Supreme Court.  Molina did not, and consequently the judgment in CA G.R. SP No.
18085 became final and executory as to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on Ortigas' motion for reconsideration, and after hearing
the parties in oral argument, considering their memoranda in amplification of
said oral argument, and re-examining the evidence of record, including the
records of previously decided cases -- cases involving the titles of Ortigas
which had gone through the whole range of ventilation before the Court of First
Instance, then the Court of Appeals, and finally the Supreme Court -- the Court
reconsidered its Decision of August 28, 1991, in an extended Resolution
promulgated on August 7, 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
It ruled that Ortigas' titles had already been upheld and affirmed in three (3)
other cases determined in 1906, 1985 and 1987, and that WIDORA's claim had
already been rejected by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The points stressed in the Resolution of August 7, 1992 and the
precedents relied upon, may be summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1. TCTs No. 77652
and 77653 are genuine derivatives of Original Decree of Registration No. 1425,
duly issued in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917 on April 26, 1905 by the Land
Registration Court of Manila.  The
validity of this Decree was affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court in <i>Cia.  Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo,</i> 6 Phil.
146 (1906).</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The facts in <i>Ortigas
v. Hon. Ruiz</i>, 148 SCRA 326, 331 (1987) prove that Decree No. 1425 confirmed
ownership by the Compañia Agricola de Ultramar, Ortigas' predecessor-in­-interest,
of the <i>Hacienda de Mandaloyon</i>, a large tract of land situated in what
are now the cities of Manila and Quezon City, and the municipality of Pasig.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The extant
documentary sources of the boundaries of the <i>Hacienda</i> are the technical
descriptions thereof appearing in the initial notice of hearing in G.L.R.O.
Record No. 917, which was published in two (2) newspapers of general
circulation in 1904:  the "Manila
American" and "La Democracia." Copies of the pertinent issues of
these newspapers were found in the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. and
certified copies thereof were presented in the trial court proceedings upheld
by the Court of Appeals and ultimately by the Supreme Court through a minute
resolution, in <i>del Rosario v. Ortigas</i>, G.R. No. 66110, 16 February 1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. The technical
descriptions of the land covered by the two titles above mentioned, No. 77652 and
77653, demonstrate that the land lies within the boundaries of the <i>Hacienda</i>,
as defined in those extant sources.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5. These factual
matters are set forth with greater clarity and detail in the decisions upheld
by this Court through minute resolutions in <i>Navarro v. Ortigas</i>, G.R. No.
50156, May 7, 1979 (affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R.
No. 53125-R dated December 13, 1978), and in <i>del Rosario v. Ortigas</i>,
G.R. No. 66110, February 16, 1985 (sustaining the judgment of the Court of Appeals
in AC-G.R. CV No. 61456 dated December 29, 1983).<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
The judgments having been rendered in proceedings <i>in</i> <i>rem</i>, and the
factual matters resolved in Navarro and del Rosario showing that "the land
covered by Widora's application forms part of that vast tract of land
adjudicated to Ortigas' precedessor-in-interest in the 1906 decision," the
judgments therein are binding on Widora.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.  Equally important, <i>Navarro</i> and <i>del
Rosario</i> sustained the judicial pronouncement that Transfer Certificates of
Title Numbered 77652 and 77653 had become and are now indefeasible and
incontrovertible; and this circumstance precludes cognizance by the Trial Court
of WIDORA's application for registration in its name of the same land in LRC
No. Q-336 or acquisition of jurisdiction over the case, the land now being
conclusively registered under the Torrens System in the name of Ortigas.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.  Parenthetically, WIDORA was also a party in
<i>Benito and WIDORA v. Ortigas</i>, G.R. No. 69343, February 6, 1985 -- wherein
the Court pronounced valueless the foundation of WIDORA's claims over the land
covered by TCTs No. 77652 and 77653:  an
alleged Spanish title dated April 25, 1894, <i>Titulo de Propiedad No. 4136</i>,
said to be issued in the name of one Mariano San Pedro y Esteban --
"supposedly covering land of unimaginably large proportions:  173,000 hectares in Bulacan, Nueva Ecija,
Rizal, Quezon City, Caloocan City and Pasay City."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">WIDORA's motion for reconsideration of the Resolution of August
7, 1992 was denied with finality by the Court in its Resolution dated October
28, 1992.  It bears emphasizing that
this Court's Resolution of August 7, 1992, which affirmed the decision of the
Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 18085, is binding not only on WIDORA but
also on Dolores V. Molina who, as already mentioned, did not appeal from that
decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

to her, declaring <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i> that<i>"Widora and Molina had
no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the
name of Ortigas"</i> -- Molina launched another attempt to litigate the
same cause.  She commenced in the
Regional Trial Court of Quezon City an action for reconveyance against Ortigas,
Interpublic Development Corporation, Breeders Feeds, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Atty. Renan V. Santos (Receiver of Manilabank and Interpublic and Breeders),
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Manila Philippines Temple), City
Treasurer of Quezon City, City Assessor of Quezon City and Register of Deeds of
Quezon City.  The action was docketed as
Case No. Q-90-4749 and raffled to Branch 88.  This time Molina based her claim to the twelve hectares of land at <i>Ugong
Norte</i> (indicated more precisely as measuring 126,278 sq. m.) on an alleged
transfer -- not from WIDORA but from Eusebia Molina and her heirs Avelino P.
Ramos and Felix P. Micael sometime in 1939 -- and further averred that she had
been unable to attend to the titling of the property in her name because her
time and efforts were entirely occupied with being her family's breadwinner.</p>

said Court ordered the remand of the reconveyance case to Branch 88 of the
Quezon City Regional Trial Court, there to be consolidated with the
registration case of WIDORA, LRC Case No. Q-336.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court evidently placed reliance on the original
Decision of this Court (Third Division) in G.R. No. 91797 dated August 28, 1991
(directing remand "to the trial court [of the proceedings] for trial and
adjudication on the merits"), which had not attained finality at that time
and, what is worse, was later completely reversed and set aside.  As already stated, this Court reconsidered
the decision of August 28, 1991 and eventually affirmed the judgment of the
Court of Appeals, commanding the dismissal of WIDORA's application for
registration.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Consolidation of Molina's reconveyance case with said LRC Case No. Q-336 was
therefore no longer possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is germane to point out that on November 11, 1991 -- about a
year after the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 18085 became
final and executory as to her, holding <i>inter alia</i> that<i>"Widora
and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been
titled in the name of Ortigas</i>,<i>"</i> and barely two (2) months after
the Court of Appeals had resolved (albeit erroneously) to remand her
reconveyance case (No. Q-90-4749) to Branch 88 of the Quezon City Regional
Trial Court for consolidation with LRC Case No. Q-336 -- Molina initiated still
another attempt to litigate exactly the same claim.  She filed the petition for reconstitution (LRC Case No. Q-5405)
which has given rise to one of the present proceedings (G.R No. 109645).</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">V. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i><u>The Court's Opinion</u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">A painstaking analysis of the record of the cases at bar in
relation to the relevant antecedents convinces the Court that the proceedings
in the <i>sala</i> of respondent Judge Velasco, LRC Case No. Q-5404, which
resulted in the reconstitution of Molina's title, are tainted with serious,
even invalidating, defects and must consequently be nullified and set aside.</p>

Notice<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court heard and decided the reconstitution case
without having acquired jurisdiction of the nature or subject matter.  Republic Act No. 26, entitled <i>"An
Act Providing A Special Procedure For The Reconstitution of Torrens Certificate
of Title Lost or Destroyed</i>,<i>"</i> specifies the requisites to be met
in order that the court may acquire competence to act on a petition for
reconstitution of title and grant the appropriate remedy.  These requisites, which this Court has
repeatedly held to be mandatory and jurisdictional, are set forth in Section 13
of the statute.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The controlling doctrine as regards the indispensability of
notice on the parties named in the statute is set out in <i>Manila Railroad</i>

<blockquote>"If no notice of the date of hearing of a reconstitution case
is served on a possessor or one having interest in the property involved, he is
deprived of his day in court and the order of reconstitution is null and void,
even if otherwise the said order should have been final and executory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 26, notice of
publication is not sufficient but such notice must be actually sent or
delivered to parties affected by the petition for reconstitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Judge Velasco's attention was drawn to the defects in the notice
required by law.  In point of fact,
neither the petition for reconstitution nor the Trial Court's Order requiring
publication in the Official Gazette indicated the names and addresses of any
occupant or person in possession of the property covered by the reconstitution
case, or any owner of the adjoining properties.  It was clear, too, that no notice had been given to Ortigas
which, as owner of road lots within the area in question, should be deemed an
"interested party" in legal contemplation (although this latter
defect was cured by Ortigas' subsequent intervention and participation in the
reconstitution case).</p>

<p class="BODY">Yet the Judge did not require Molina to give notice of the
petition to the adjoining owners and interested parties; this, despite
expressly acknowledging in his Order dated July 3, 1992, that his court had not
as of that time indeed acquired jurisdiction over the reconstitution case "considering
the manifestation of ** (Solicitor) Ma. Eloisa Castro that the requirement of
notice to the other adjacent owners has not as yet been submitted to the Court
altho apparently the land in question is being bounded by roads."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead, at Molina's instance, he authorized her to send notices of the
petition to the President of the Corinthian Homeowners Association, the
Director of the Bureau of Lands and the City Engineer of Quezon City.  Now, obviously these three, whatever
interest they may have in the case, or in the property involved, are not the
adjoining owners contemplated by law, on whom notice of the reconstitution
proceedings must be served.  Nor did
they, by their receipt of notice of the petition, incur the legal obligation to
transmit such notice to the actual owners of the adjoining lots, assuming they
had knowledge of the latter's identities.  There was thus, as a matter of actual fact, no notice of the petition
ever given to the <i>owner(s) of the adjoining properties and all other
interested parties</i>..  There was,
therefore, through a faulty reading of the statute, or due to a desire to end
the proceedings quickly, or because of some covert purpose, a failure to comply
with the law and a resultant failure on the part of the court to acquire jurisdiction
over the nature or subject-matter of the case.</p>

Withdrawn Case<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Another serious error was the "revival" or
reinstatement by His Honor of the case, some four months after it had been
dismissed pursuant to Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, upon an <i>ex parte</i>
motion of Dolores V. Molina.</p>

<p class="BODY">As above stated, on November 14, 1991 Molina filed with the
Regional Trial Court of Quezon City her application for the reconstitution of
her Transfer Certificate of Title No. 124088, which was docketed as LRC Case
No. Q-5404.  Fifteen days later, she
moved for permission to withdraw the petition, stating that she had to go to
the United States on business for some ten (10) months.  The case was dismissed, or deemed withdrawn,
by order of the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Four months later, however, or on or about April 2, 1992, Molina
filed an <i>ex parte</i> motion to "revive" LRC Case No. Q-5404 and
for admission of an amended petition for reconstitution of her title.  The motion was granted in one or two days
and the petition set for hearing.  This
is manifest error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary
period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove
the case from the Court's docket.  Even
assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be
reinstated or "revived" by mere motion in the original docketed
action, but only by the filing of another complaint accompanied, of course, by
the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law.  The situation is not at all altered by the
circumstance that the dismissal of the action was effected by the plaintiff as
a matter of right, without order of the court, in accordance with Rule 17 of
the Rules of Court.  There having been a
dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order
considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could
not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the
filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of Rule 17 provides that an action "may be
dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court by filing a notice of
dismissal at any time before service of the answer or of a motion for summary
judgment." Such a dismissal (or withdrawal) "is without
prejudice" (i.e., without prejudice to its re-institution) unless
"otherwise stated in the notice" (e.g., the notice actually declares
the dismissal to be <i>with prejudice</i> [to its re-filing] or states some fact
barring subsequent re-litigation, e.g., that the plaintiff has in truth no
right of action against the defendant, or his right of action had prescribed,
etc.).  However, even if not so stated
expressly or impliedly, the notice of dismissal would nonetheless operate
"as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once
dismissed in a competent court an action based on or including the same
claim" (in other words, a plaintiff may not dismiss his action as a matter
of right, by mere notice, more than once).</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, a plaintiff who has dismissed his action by notice
under this provision may later change his mind and decide to continue with
it.  In that event, since theoretically
every final disposition of an action does not attain finality until after
fifteen (15) days therefrom, and consequently within that time the action still
remains within the control of the Court, the plaintiff may move to withdraw and
set aside his notice of dismissal and revive his action, before that period lapses.  But after the dismissal has become final
through the lapse of the fifteen-day reglementary period, the only way by which
the action may be resuscitated or "revived," is by the institution of
a subsequent action through the filing of another complaint and the payment of
the fees prescribed by law.  This is so
because upon attainment of finality of the dismissal through the lapse of said
reglementary period, the Court loses jurisdiction and control over it and can
no longer make any disposition in respect thereof inconsistent with such
dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of Judge Velasco reviving the reconstitution case was
therefore legally inefficacious.  It
could not and did not operate to reinstate the proceeding.  And even assuming that the amended petition
submitted by Molina together with her motion to revive the case may be deemed a
new petition, the non-payment of the requisite docketing fees precluded the
acquisition of jurisdiction by the Trial Court over the second proceeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

1960's, had sought the help of former President Marcos for the purpose; that
unknown to her, the latter had succeeded in subsequently getting that title for
her; and that the certificate of title was actually delivered to her by Col.

<blockquote>Probably out of a desire to get the Mormons out of the picture
("off her back,"), by inducing them to withdraw the appeal they were
taking from Judge Velasco's decision in the reconstitution case, LRC Case No.
Q-5404 -- Molina executed under date of December 18, 1992 a document
denominated "Quitclaim and Waiver," admitting the Mormons' ownership
"** over the portion covered by RT-58287 (124088) with an area of 8,860

The document produced the desired result.  The Mormons did withdraw their appeal.  What Molina did not realize, however, was that by recognizing the
Mormons' ownership, she thereby inferentially acknowledged ownership of Ortigas
from whom the former had acquired their property.</blockquote>

Between Trial Court's Conclusions and Supreme Court's Prior Final Dispositions
Anent Ortigas' Titles<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Perhaps the most decisive factors in the resolution of this
controversy are the final dispositions already made by this Court relative to
the titles of Ortigas, which Molina would invalidate and overthrow, and to
which the attention of the respondent Judge had been insistently drawn.  These dispositions are matters of public
record, are indeed facts of judicial notice which it is not possible for the
Court to ignore.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no debate about the fact that the land being claimed by
Molina lies within that titled in the name of Ortigas and its
predecessor-in-interest.  Now, the
latter's documents of ownership have been passed upon, and sanctioned and
sustained by this Court more than once.  These dispositions and adjudgments now operate to put its title to the
lands thereby covered and embraced beyond the pale of further judicial inquiry.  No court in the country now has competence
to take cognizance of applications for the registration anew of said lands in
the name of persons other than Ortigas or its predecessor-in-interest, or
successors and assigns, or entertain further challenges to the validity and
efficacy of the latter's titles.  These
matters have long since been laid to rest by this Court's decisions, already
described earlier,<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="NUM">1. The Court's judgment in <i>Cia. Agricola</i> <i>de</i> <i>Ultramar
v. Domingo</i>, 6 Phil. 146 (1906) affirmed on appeal the validity of Original
Decree of Registration No. 1425, duly issued in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917 on
April 26, 1905 by the Land Registration Court of Manila, in relation to the <i>Hacienda
de Mandaloyon</i>, a large tract of land situated in what is now the cities of
Manila and Quezon City, and the Municipality of Pasig, in favor of the Compañia
Agricola de Ultramar, predecessor-in-interest of Ortigas.  Ortigas' titles, TCTs No. 77652 and 77653
are genuine derivatives thereof of the title of the Cia. Agricola de Ultramar.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. <i>Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz</i>, 148 SCRA 326, 331 (1987) is
additional affirmation of the confirmation by Decree No. 1425 of the ownership
of the Compañia Agricola de Ultramar of the <i>Hacienda de Mandaloyon</i>.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The Court's Minute Resolution dated 16 February 1985 in <i>Del
Rosario v. Ortigas</i>, G.R. No. 66110, refusing to review on <i>certiorari</i>
the judgment of the Court of Appeals therein challenged, in effect sustained
the latter.  Said judgment of the Court
of Appeals pertinently ruled that the extant documentary sources of the
boundaries of the <i>Hacienda de Mandaloyon</i> are the technical descriptions
thereof appearing in the initial notice of hearing in G.L.R.O Record No. 917,
which was published in two (2) newspapers of general circulation in 1904:  the "Manila American" and "La
Democracia" and that copies of the pertinent issues of these newspapers
were found in the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. and certified copies
thereof were presented in the trial court proceedings.  The technical descriptions of the land
covered by the two titles above mentioned, No. 77652 and 77653, demonstrate
that the land lies within the boundaries of the <i>Hacienda</i>, as defined in
those extant sources.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. These facts were also upheld by this Court through a minute
resolution in <i>Navarro v. Ortigas</i>, G.R. No. 50156, May 7, 1979 (affirming
the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 53125-­R dated December 13,
1978), and in <i>del Rosario v. Ortigas</i>, G.R. No. 66110, 16 February 16,
1985 (sustaining the judgment of the Court of Appeals in AC-G.R. CV No. 61456
dated December 29, 1983).<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
The judgments were rendered in proceedings <i>in rem</i>.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Both <i>Navarro </i>and<i> del Rosario</i> sustained the
judicial pronouncement that Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 77652 and
77653 of Ortigas had become indefeasible and incontrovertible -- a circumstance
that precluded cognizance by the Trial Court of WIDORA'S subsequent application
for registration in its name of the same land, docketed as LRC No. Q-336,
considering that "the land covered by Widora's application forms part of
that vast tract of land adjudicated to Ortigas' precedessor-in-interest in the
1906 decision."</p>

<p class="NUM">6. This Court's Resolution of August 7, 1992, which affirmed the
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 18085 (rendered on November
27, 1989), is binding not only on WIDORA but also on Dolores V. Molina who did
not appeal from said decision of the Court of Appeals.  In that decision of November 27, 1989, it
will be recalled, the Court of Appeals declared that the decree recognizing
Ortigas' titles to the lands embraced in its titles (TCTs No. 77652 and 77653)
was binding against the whole world and constituted <i>res</i> <i>judicata</i>.  It categorically ruled that "<i>Widora
and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been
titled in the name of Ortigas</i>."</p>

<p class="NUM">7. Judge Velasco's awareness of the existence of decades-old
Torrens titles covering the land subject of the reconstitution case commenced
by Dolores Molina, should have deterred him from proceeding therewith, or
impelled him to proceed with the utmost caution, in line with this Court's
pronouncements in <i>Alabang</i> <i>Development</i> <i>Corporation et al. v.
Valenzuela</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>

In said rulings, this Court has cautioned "courts ** (to) exercise the <i>greatest
caution</i> in entertaining ** petitions for reconstitution of allegedly lost
certificates of title, particularly where the petitions are filed ** after an
inexplicable delay ** after the alleged loss.  ** ** We can take judicial notice of innumerable litigations and
controversies that have been spawned by the reckless and hasty grant of such
reconstitution of alleged lost or destroyed titles as well as of the numerous
purchasers who have been victimized by forged or fake titles or their areas
simply 'expanded' through 'table surveys' with the cooperation of unscrupulous
officials."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
So, too, this Court has stressed "that lands already covered by duly
issued existing Torrens titles (which become incontrovertible upon the
expiration of one year from their issuance under section 38 of the Land
Registration Act) cannot be the subject of petitions <i>for</i> <i>reconstitution</i>
of allegedly lost or destroyed titles filed by <i>third</i> <i>parties</i> <i>without
first</i> securing by final judgment the cancellation of such existing
titles.  (And as the Court reiterated in
the recent case of Silvestre vs. Court of Appeals G.R. Nos. L-32694 and
L-33119, July 16, 1982], ‘in cases of annulment and/or reconveyance of title, a
party seeking it should establish not merely by a preponderance of evidence but
by clear and convincing evidence that the land sought to be reconveyed is his’)
** ** ("considering the ease and facility with which documents are made to
appear as official and authentic" e.g., "from mere xerox copies and

affixed therein."<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>)</p>

Dismiss Appeals of Ortigas and Solicitor General<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Yet another serious error was the disallowance by His Honor of
Ortigas' appeal from the judgment in the reconstitution case, declaring its
notice of appeal to be nothing but "a mere scrap of paper."<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
His Honor opined that "Ortigas is * * not vested with any justiciable
interest to be a party in (the) case" because it had admittedly
"already sold all the subdivision lots which it claims to overlap the
disputed two lots (of Molina)," and Ortigas' pleadings "failed to
disclose ** any allegation about its ownership of road lots that may overlap
the land covered by the certificate of title of petitioner sought to be
reconstituted;" and that therefore Ortigas was not a real party in
interest since it would neither derive benefit nor suffer injury from the
decision; hence, its opposition could not be entertained and, "by force of
law," it could not also appeal the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">His Honor was apparently incognizant of the principle that
dismissals of appeals from the judgment of a Regional Trial Court by the latter
are authorized only in the instances specifically set forth in Section 13, Rule
41 of the Rules of Court.  The
succeeding provision, Section 14 of said Rule 41, provides that "(a)
motion to dismiss an appeal may be filed in the (Regional Trial) Court ** prior
to the transmittal of the record to the appellate court;" and the grounds
are limited to those "mentioned in the preceding section," i.e.,
Section 13, to wit:  where "the
notice of appeal, appeal bond, or record on appeal is not filed within the
period of time herein provided * * ."</p>

<p class="BODY">These two (2) sections clearly establish "that unless the
appeal is abandoned, the only ground for dismissing an appeal in the trial
court is the failure of the appellant to file on time the notice of appeal,
appeal bond, or record on appeal.  * *
(A) trial court may not dismiss an appeal as frivolous, or on the ground that
the case has become moot and academic, such step devolving upon the appellate
courts.  Otherwise, the way would be
opened for (regional trial) courts * * to forestall review or reversal of their
decisions by higher courts, no matter how erroneous or improper such decisions
should be."<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Note, however, that since the requirement of an appeal bond or a
record on appeal has been eliminated, dismissal of the appeal on the ground of
a failure to file said bond or record within the prescribed period is no longer
possible.  Exceptionally, a record on
appeal is still required in special proceedings and cases where multiple
appeals are allowed; hence, a failure in these instances to file a record on
appeal within the reglementary period is still a ground for dismissal of an
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dismissals of appeal may also be had upon the grounds specified
by Rule 50 of the Rules of Court; but it is the Court of Appeals, not the trial
court, which is explicitly authorized to dismiss appeals on said grounds.  Generally, these grounds do not include
matters which go into the merits of the cause or to the right of the plaintiff
or defendant to recover.<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
Case law has come to recognize other grounds for dismissal, by way of
exception, e.g., that the cause has become moot,<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
or the appeal is frivolous or manifestly dilatory.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
But, to repeat, authority to dismiss an appeal on the ground that it is
frivolous or taken manifestly for delay "is not certainly with the court <i>a
quo</i> whose decision is in issue, but with the appellate court."<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the Trial Judge's conclusion that Ortigas had no
material interest in the litigation and therefore no standing to appeal from
the decision therein is incorrect.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is in the first place, the conceded fact that Ortigas still
retained title to a considerable number of street lots within the land in
question, which it would lose if the entire area were declared to belong to
Molina.  Again, the respondent Judge's
acknowledgment of Ortigas' status of vendor of all the subdivision lots covered
by Molina's adverse claim, was implicit recognition of its right and obligation
to defend its vendees' titles being impugned by Molina precisely on the theory
that Ortigas' titles were void, a right and obligation arising from the
warranty against eviction imposed on it by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a>
The avoidance of liability for eviction is certainly an interest of sufficient
substance to concede to Ortigas capacity to litigate as party in interest in
the reconstitution proceeding, prescinding from its stated intention of
preventing the perpetration of fraud by Molina upon Ortigas' vendees and
successors-in-interest and upon the public at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrines and legal considerations just set out also
demonstrate the error of the Trial Judge's striking out of the appeal sought to
be taken by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) from the adverse Orders
in LRC Case No. Q-5404 on the theory that its appeal was "sham"
because it had "not filed any formal opposition to the petition and
neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its
dismissal, etc.<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Prescinding from the patent fact that the records do contain (1)
the formal objection of the OSG to Molina's petition for reconstitution on the
ground <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i> that no actual notice had been given to the
adjacent owners, an omission that the Trial Judge had precisely acknowledged;<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a>
(2) the report of the Land Registration Authority drawing the Court's attention
to irregularities in the petition, e.g., that the plan relied upon by Molina,
Psd-16740 "appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-­1148
&amp; Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of
original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been
issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;" that said plan "is
a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title
in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589," etc.;<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
(3) the notice of appeal of the OSG from the judgment of September 23, 1992;<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a>
(4) the motion of the OSG for reconsideration of the Order of October 14, 1992<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
--­ unmistakably indicating the active opposition of the OSG to the Molina
petition for reconstitution -- the rule, as already explained, is that Trial
Courts have no competence to dismiss appeals on the stated ground or any other
going to the merits thereof.  While it
may be assumed that Trial Courts are morally convinced of the correctness of
the judgments and orders that they promulgate, and hence, in most cases, they
honestly believe that appeals from their judgments or final orders are inutile,
frivolous, dilatory, this gives them no warrant to reject appeals on these
grounds; otherwise, the right of appeal would be rendered largely illusory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, as regards the other ground cited by the Trial Judge for
dismissal of the Solicitor General's appeal:  tardiness.  The record shows that
the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) received notice of the judgment of
September 23, 1992 on September 24, 1992.  The OSG posted its notice of appeal at the Ermita Post Office on October
9, 1992, i.e., on the fifteenth day after its receipt of notice of the
judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a>
The timeliness of the appeal is thus beyond dispute.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">F.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Trial Court's Lack of Authority to
Order Immediate Execution<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The grant of Molina's motion for immediate execution of the
judgment for reconstitution of her title, pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 39 of
the Rules of Court, constitutes yet another serious error.  Insofar as it is premised on the theory that
Ortigas' appeal was "frivolous and interposed only for purposes of
delay," such grant is indefensible for the reasons already stated relative
to the Judge's disallowance of the Ortigas appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also attempted to justify immediate execution as necessary
in order "to prevent wastage of income," or "avoid the
possibility of ** judgment becoming illusory or to minimize damage unduly
suffered by the prevailing party or to prevent further damage," as well as
by Molina's "advanced age." In the context of the circumstances
obtaining in the case at bar, these grounds are meaningless.  The Trial Judge could not be unaware that
Ortigas' titles had existed for many, many years.  Granting that His Honor had been made to believe by Molina's
evidence that those titles should be invalidated, and decreed this in his
judgment, he may not, ascribing such infallibility to his judgment as to
preclude the possibility of its being overturned on appeal, condemn any appeal
sought to be taken therefrom as idle and merely generative of needless injury
to the prevailing party.  Otherwise, the
exception would become the general rule; judgments such as that rendered in
this case could be routinely executed on the assertion that the prevailing
party would suffer injury because his income would be wasted, or he would be
caused further damage, or, that he is of advanced age, absent any competent and
persuasive showing that precisely because of his age, he would not survive an
appeal.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">G.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Forum-Shopping by Molina<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the relevant records expose Molina's forum-shopping,
warranting imposition of the sanctions prescribed by established rule.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. As earlier narrated, in CA G.R. SP No. 18085 -- treating of an
attack against Ortigas' titles by Widows and Orphans Association, Inc. (WIDORA)
and Dolores Molina -- the Court of Appeals granted the writ of <i>certiorari</i>
prayed for, annulling and setting aside the Orders of the Trial Court which had
sustained WIDORA's and Molina's assaults against said titles.  In its decision promulgated on November 27,
1989, the Court of Appeals declared that the decades-old decree recognizing
Ortigas' ownership of the lands embraced in its titles (TCTs No. 77652 and
77653) was binding against the whole world and constituted <i>res</i> <i>judicata</i>,
and categorically ruled that <i>"Widora and Molina had no more right to
apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas</i>.<i>"</i>
This judgment became final and executory as to Molina, for while WIDORA
appealed to the Supreme Court, Molina did not.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. This notwithstanding, on February 22, 1990 -- about two (2)
months after said judgment in CA G.R. SP No. 18085 became final and executory
as to Molina, said judgment, to repeat, having held <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i>
that <i>"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands
which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas"</i> -- Molina
initiated another attempt to litigate the same cause.  She instituted in the Quezon City Regional Trial Court an action
for reconveyance against Ortigas, Interpublic Development Corporation, Breeders
Feeds, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a>
Atty. Renan V. Santos (Receiver of Manilabank and Interpublic and Breeders),
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Manila Philippines Temple), City
Treasurer of Quezon City, City Assessor of Quezon City and Register of Deeds of
Quezon City.  This time she imputed her
claim to the same land at <i>Ugong Norte</i> (with an area of 126,278 sq. m.)
to an alleged transfer -- not by assignment from WIDORA but by purchase from
Eusebia Molina and her heirs Avelino P. Ramos and Felix P. Micael sometime in
1939.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again this action ultimately resulted in a judgment adverse to
Molina.  In another <i>certiorari</i>
action (CA G.R. SP NO. 23588), the Court of Appeals, by decision dated July 23,
1991, set aside the Trial Court's judgment and directed the dismissal of
Molina's action.<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. Then on November 11, 1991 -- a year or so after the
above-mentioned decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 18085 became
final and executory (holding <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i> that <i>"Widora and
Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been
titled in the name of Ortigas</i>,<i>"</i>) and some two (2) months after
the Court of Appeals had directed the dismissal of Molina's second action (No.
Q-90-4749, Branch 88 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court) -- Molina again
launched yet another attempt, a third, to litigate exactly the same claim.  She filed the petition for reconstitution
(LRC Case No. Q-5405) which has given rise to one of the present proceedings,
G.R. No. 109645.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. In Case No. Q-93-15920 of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial
Court of Quezon City, instituted in 1993 by the Manila Banking Corporation
(Manilabank) for annulment of the titles of Dolores Molina and her vendee,
Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., Molina asserted substantially the same
claims made in the actions above mentioned.  This she did by way of a motion to dismiss which was however
denied.  On December 1, 1993, she filed
through her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with this Court (docketed as G.R. No. 112564) -- to annul the Regional Trial
Court's Order dated September 17, 1993 denying her motion to dismiss, and that
dated November 25, 1993, denying reconsideration.  Eight (8) days later, on December 9, 1993, through the same
lawyer, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, Molina filed another <i>petition</i> <i>for</i>
<i>certiorari</i> <i>with the Court of Appeals, also dated November 29, 1993
(docketed as CA-G.R. No. 32778) which, as heretofore stated, is identical to
that filed in this Court </i>on December 1, 1993, the only difference being
that instead of the Supreme Court as the tribunal where the same was filed, it
is the Court of Appeals that is indicated.<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></span></span></a>
Except for this, to repeat, <i>each page, from page 1 to page 11 of the Molina
petition in this Court, is exactly the same as each page, from page 1 to page
11, of her petition in the Court of Appeals</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts plainly and amply demonstrate Molina's guilt of
forum-shopping, i.e., the act of a party against whom an adverse judgment has
been rendered in one forum, of seeking another (and possibly favorable) opinion
in another forum other than by appeal or the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>),<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a>
or the institution of two (2) or more actions or proceedings grounded on the
same cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a
favorable disposition.  Forum-shopping
is contumacious, as well as an act of malpractice that is proscribed and
condemned as trifling with the courts and abusive of their processes.  A violation of the rule against
forum-shopping warrants prosecution for contempt of court and constitutes ground
for summary dismissal of the actions involved, without prejudice to appropriate
administrative action against the counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">H.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>No Need for Remand of Case to Court A
Quo<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be
the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-5405) to the Court of origin
with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the
judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course
and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal.  This, in fact, is a relief alternatively
prayed for by petitioner Ortigas.  Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or
cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and
subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous.  Upon the facts, it is not possible for
Molina's cause to prosper.  To defer
adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.</p>

obviously voted on the case for the first time.  The change of votes of Gutierrez, Jr. and Davide, <i>JJ</i>. was
occasioned by what they deemed to be the conclusive facts laid bare clearly and
