Originally, this was an appeal by defendants from the Decision of the 
then Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XX, in Civil Case No. 
73942, to the Court of Appeals (now Intermediate Appellate Court), which
 Tribunal, certified the case to us because the issue is a pure question
 of law.
<p>
On December 13, 1943, Nicolas Adamos and Vicente Feria, 
defendants-appellants herein, purchased two lots forming part of the 
Piedad Estate in Quezon City, with an area of approximately 56,395 
square meters, from Juan Porciuncula.  Sometime thereafter, the 
successors-in-interest of the latter filed Civil Case No. 174 in the 
then Court of First Instance of Quezon City for annulment of the sale 
and the cancellation of transfer Certificate of Title No. 69475, which 
had been issued to defendants-appellants by virtue of the disputed sale.
  On December 18, 1963, the Court rendered a Decision annulling the 
sale, cancelling TCT 69475, and authorizing the issuance of a new title 
in favor of Porciuncula's successors-in-interest.  The said judgment was
 affirmed by the Appellate Court and had attained finality.
</p><p>
In the meantime, on May 29, 1946, during the pendency of the 
above-mentioned case, defendants-appellants sold to GENEROSA Ayson 
Simon, plaintiff-appellee herein, the two lots in question for P3,800.00
 each, plus an additional P800.00 paid subsequently for the purpose of 
facilitating the issuance of new titles in GENEROSA's name.  Due to the 
failure of defendants-appellants to comply with their commitment to have
 the subdivision plan of the lots approved and to deliver the titles and
 possession to GENEROSA, the latter filed suit for specific performance 
before the Court of First Instance of Quezon City on September 4, 1963 
(Civil Case No. Q-7275).  On January 20, 1964, said Court ordered:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the plaintiff is declared entitled to a summary 
judgment and the defendants are hereby ordered to have the subdivision 
of Lot No. 6, Block No. 2, and Lot No. 11, Block No. 3, relocated and 
resurveyed and the subdivision plan approved and, if not possible for 
one reason or another, and in case of the absence or loss of said 
subdivision, to cause and effect the subdivision of the said lots and 
deliver the titles and possession thereof to the plaintiff.  As to the 
claim and counterclaim for damages, let the hearing thereon be deferred 
until further move by the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, since execution of the foregoing Order was rendered impossible 
because of the judgment in Civil Case No. 174, which earlier declared 
the sale of the lots in question by Juan Porciuncula to 
defendants-appellants to be null and void, GENEROSA filed, on August 16,
 1968, another suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case
 No. 73942) for rescission of the sale with damages.  On June 7, 1969, 
the Court rendered judgment, the disposi­tive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff and 
against defendants, ordering the latter, jointly and severally, to pay 
the former the sum of P7,600.00, the total amount received by them from 
her as purchase price of the two lots, with legal rate of interest from 
May 29, 1946 until fully paid; another sum of P800.00, with legal rate 
of interest from August 1, 1966 until fully paid; the sum of P1,000.00 
for attorney's fees; and the costs of this suit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, the appeal before the Appellate Court on the ground that 
GENEROSA's action had prescribed, considering that she had only four 
years from May 29, 1946, the date of sale, within which to rescind said 
transaction, and that her complaint for specific performance may be 
deemed as a waiver of her right to rescission since the fulfillment and 
rescission of an obligation are alternative and not cumulative remedies.
</p><p>
The appeal is without merit.  The Trial Court presided by then Judge, 
later Court of Appeals Associate Justice Luis B. Reyes, correctly 
resolved the issues, reiterated in the assignments of error on appeal, 
as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Defendants contend (1) that the fulfillment and the rescission of
 the obligation in reciprocal ones are alternative remedies, and 
plaintiff having chosen fulfillment in Civil Case No. Q-7525, she cannot
 now seek rescission; and (2) that even if plaintiff could seek 
re­scission the action to rescind the obligation has prescribed."
  </p>
  <p> "The first contention is without merit.  The rule that the injured
 party can only choose between fulfillment and rescission of the 
obligation, and cannot have both, applies when the obligation is 
possible of fulfillment.  If, as in this case, the fulfillment has 
become impossible, Article 1191<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  allows the injured party to seek rescission even after he has chosen fulfillment.
  </p>
  <p> "True it is that in Civil Case No. 7275 the Court already rendered
 a Decision in favor of plaintiff, but since defendants cannot fulfill 
their obligation to deliver the titles to and possession of the lots to 
plaintiff, the portion of the decision requiring them to fulfill their 
obligations is without force and effect.  Only that portion relative to 
the payment of damages remains in the dispositive part of the decision, 
since in either case (fulfillment or rescission) defendants may be 
re­quired to pay damages. </p>
  <p> "The next question to determine is whether the action to rescind the obligation has prescribed. </p>
  <p> "Article 1191 of the Civil Code provides that the injured party 
may also seek rescission, if the fulfillment should become impossible.  
The cause of action to claim rescission arises when the fulfillment of 
the obligation became impossible when the Court of First Instance of 
Quezon City in Civil Case No. 174 declared the sale of the land to 
defendants by Juan Porciuncula a complete nullity and ordered the 
cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 69475 issued to them. 
 Since the two lots sold to plaintiff by defendants form part of the 
land involved in Civil Case No. 174, it became impossible for defendants
 to secure and deliver the titles to and the possession of the lots to 
plaintiff.  But plaintiff had to wait for the finality of the decision 
in Civil Case No. 174.  According to the certification of the clerk of 
the Court of First Instance of Quezon City (Exhibit 'E-2'), the decision
 in Civil Case No. 174 became final and executory 'as per entry of 
Judgment dated May 3, 1967 of the Court of Appeals.'  The action for 
rescission must be commenced within four years from that date, May 3, 
1967. Since the complaint for rescission was filed on August 16, 1968, 
the four year period within which the action must be commenced had not 
expired. </p>
  <p> "Defendants have the obligation to return to plaintiff the amount 
of P7,600.00 representing the purchase price of the two lots, and the 
amount of P800.00 which they received from plaintiff to expedite the 
issuance of titles but which they could not secure by reason of the 
decision in Civil Case No. 174.  Defendant has to pay interest at the 
legal rate on the amount of P7,600.00 from May 29, 1946, when they 
received the amount upon the execution of the deeds of sale, and legal 
interest on the P800.00 from August 1, 1966, when they received the same
 from plaintiff."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment of the former Court of First Instance 
of Manila, Branch XX, in Civil Case No. 73942, dated June 7, 1969, is 
hereby affirmed in toto.  Costs against defendants-appellants.
SO ORDERED.
