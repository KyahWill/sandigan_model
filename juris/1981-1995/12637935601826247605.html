				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The controversy at bar had its origin in the sale to two (2)
different persons of the same property comprised of three (3) parcels of land.
The contending parties are: the transferees of the first vendee of a portion of
the property, on the one hand, and on the other, the persons to whom the second
vendee conveyed the entire property thirty-one years after buying it. The
successors-in-interest of the first vendee ground their claim on the deed of
sale by which two of the three lots were sold to them, registered under Act No.
3344, and the fact of continuous occupancy of the property for more than thirty
(30) years. The buyers of the second vendee, on the other hand, rely on their
predecessor’s Transfer Certificate of Title as well as that subsequently issued
in their own names by the Register of Deeds. Between them, there is no dispute
about the essential facts, hereunder briefly narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two sales were made by <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span>. She was the owner in fee simple of the three
(3) parcels of land in question, located at <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 90-45
in her name. The parcels are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> described in the title as follows: Lot No. 1,
containing an area of 54,321 square meters; Lot No. 3, with an area of 86
square meters; and Lot No. 9, with an area of 21 square meters, more or less.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1925" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1925</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> sold <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Lots Numbered 3 and 9</b> to one Agustin <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>. Some months later, or more precisely on <st1:date year="1926" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1926</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
sold the same two (2) parcels to the spouses, Pedro Francisco and Francisca <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>. Afterwards, the property was declared in the
name of their son, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco, the petitioner
in this case, who continued in possession of the property after his parents’
demise.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Three (3) years later, <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> executed another deed of sale dated <st1:date year="1928" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1928</st1:date>, this time conveying
all <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">the three (3) parcels</b> of land
covered by her title, TCT No. 9045, in favor of a certain <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Afable</span>. The sale included, in other words, not only
Lot No. 1, described in the title as having an area of 54,321 square meters but
also <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Lots Numbered 3 and 9</b> already
sold to Agustin <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Afable</span> registered the sale under the Torrens Act and
obtained title in her own name, numbered 14256.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirty-one (31) years afterwards, or on September 22, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> sold the property
to the persons now private respondents in this case, to wit: <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, etc., who
will hereafter be simply referred to as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">the
<span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span></i>. The <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span>
obtained a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title in their names, numbered 70517.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Shorty</span> after the sale, the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco
to vacate lots Numbered 3 and 9, which the latter was occupying and on which
was in fact standing a house that he had constructed. As might be expected, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> refused. The <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span>
thereupon sued him for recovery of title and possession in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court’s verdict went against the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span>.
It dismissed their action and declared <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
Francisco the rightful owner of Lots No. 3 and 9. The Court pointed out that
while a Torrens title is indefeasible, the reality could not be ignored that it
could be issued by mistake;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the registration of the sale by <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> to Agustin <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
the (immediate predecessor of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco’s
parents) was binding on third parties and specially on the parties to the sale
themselves, so that when <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> executed a
second deed of sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>, conveying not only Lot No. 1 but also Lots Numbered
3 and 9, the sale could not have been valid as regards the latter two (2) lots
because <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> was no longer the owner thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Trial Court, on
appeal taken by the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span>. By judgment
promulgated on <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1968</st1:date>,
the Appellate Court declared <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco to
have no right over Lots Numbered 3 and 9, and ordered him to vacate the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It ruled that registration by <span class="SpellE">Candido’s</span> parents (or
their predecessor) of the deed of sale in their favor under Act No. 3344 was
ineffectual to bind registered land, such as that subject of the case at bar
(citing <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, et al. v. Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Magali</span>, L-15133, May 31, 1963, at p. 396, The Phil. Torrens
System, F.D. R. Ponce); that the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span> must be
deemed purchasers in good faith considering that no annotation regarding the
prior sale of the property appeared in either the title of their immediate
predecessor, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>
(No. 142561) or that of the latter’s own predecessor, <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> (No. 9045), awareness of the alleged
prior conveyance of Lots Numbered 3 and 9 to the <span class="SpellE">Franciscos</span>
having come to them only after their acquisition of the property from <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>; and that the principle – that as between two
innocent purchasers of the same property the party negligent must suffer – must
be applied adversely to <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco, since his
parents and their predecessor (as first vendee) were negligent in omitting to
have the sale in their favor annotated on TCT No. 9045.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco has filed with us a
petition for review on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">certiorari</i>
urging us to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals because of what he
submits to be serious errors committed by it, <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">viz</i></span> (1) applying the general
principle that a person dealing with registered land need not go beyond the
certificate of title, (2) holding the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span> to be
purchasers in good faith; (3) applying the rule that as between two innocent
purchasers, the one negligent must suffer the loss; (4) not adjudging that <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> (the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span>’ predecessor) had no title to transfer to the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span> and not applying the law on double sale embodied
in Article 1478 (now Article 1544) of the Civil Code and (5) not recognizing <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco’s title to the property under general
principles of equity, <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and prescription, in
light of their actual, continuous, peaceful and open possession of the property
under a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">bona fide</i> claim of ownership,
for no less than thirty-six (36) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The whole controversy ultimately boils down to the question,
whether or not under the admitted facts, the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span>
are buyers in good faith, and therefore entitled to the full protection of the
Torrens Act. The Court of Appeals declared them to be so, as already earlier
stated. It said that the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span> –</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> purchased the lots in question in
good faith and for a valuable consideration. Good faith is presumed (Art. 527,
New Civil Code) Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (<span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco) did not present: any evidence to rebut this
legal presumption.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find that there are facts on record of which unaccountably the
Court of Appeals did not take account.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is evidence, for instance, that <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
Francisco had known each other for “quite a long time, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
even before the war;” that Lots 3 and 9 are residential lots adjacent to each
other and are situated at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, only a few meters away from the municipal
building,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and said lots are about fifty meters (50 m.) away from his (<span class="SpellE">Casimiro’s</span>)
house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is evidence, not disputed, that <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
and his family had been occupying that property at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Avenue for more than thirty years, and that <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
was residing in a house built thereon, and it is not unreasonable to assume
that these facts were at least in a general way known to <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> since he had known <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
for “quite a long time x <span class="SpellE">x</span> even before the war.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is evidence, too, that <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, a businessman of no little experience, was one of
those who negotiated with <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>
for the purchase of the property; that the latter showed to <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
and his sister, <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span>, the plan of the property,
specifically indicating the bigger lot – Lot 1 x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
(the) one containing an area of more than 5 hectares;<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and they had “agreed to buy x <span class="SpellE">x</span> (the property) after
we saw it,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and that “after the sale x <span class="SpellE">x</span> (the [<span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>]) happened to see that Lots 3 and 9 are included
in the total area x <span class="SpellE">x</span> (they) paid to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
again, it is not unreasonable to assume that having actually seen Lots 3 and 9
before agreeing to buy the property, <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> also
saw <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco’s house there.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considered in context, the evidence shows quite persuasively that
<span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> knew
definitely where his friend of many years, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
Francisco was residing and that indeed <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> and
his family had been living in that place for many, many years, that when he
viewed the property then being sold to him and his brothers and sisters by <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>, he could not but
have noticed that <span class="SpellE">Candido’s</span> house was in the area,
that when <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>
pointed out the three (3) lots to them: one big lot, and two smaller ones, <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> could not but have become aware, if not of the
actuality, at least of the possibility, that the smaller contiguous lots
adjacent to the main streets (<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>), and presumably
through or beside which they had passed to view the bigger lot, appeared to be
that in which his friend, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>, was living. At any
rate, it taxes credulity to think that <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> and
his sister had limited themselves to viewing and asking questions about the big
lot only, and had completely refrained from inquiring about the location and
condition of the two (2) other lots subject of the projected sale, preferring
to place total exclusive and unquestioning reliance on <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Afable’s</span> certificate of title. The only plausible
explanation for such a singular absence of curiosity would be their awareness
that the two (2) other lots were not included in the sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">There were in a word sufficiently strong indications to impel a
closer inquiry into the location, boundaries and condition of the two (2)
smaller lots embraced in the purchase on the part of <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> and his co-vendees. That inquiry is in truth
dictated by common sense, expected of a man of ordinary prudence. “The earth,”
it has been said, is “that universal manuscript open to the eyes of all. When a
man proposes to buy or deal with realty his first duty is to read this public
manuscript, that is, to look and see who is there upon it, and what are his
rights.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
We ourselves stressed this duty several decades ago:</p>

<blockquote>“A purchaser cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a
reasonable man upon his guard , and then claim that he acted in good faith
under the belief that there was no defect in the title of the vendor. His mere
refusal to believe that such defect exists, or his willful closing of the eyes
to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his vendor’s title will not
make him an innocent purchaser for value, if it afterwards develops that the
title was in fact defective and it appears that he had such notice of the
defect would have led to its discovery had he acted with the measure of
precaution which may reasonably be required of a prudent man in a like
situation.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Had that inquiry been made, the adverse claim of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco over the two (2) small lots would have
immediately come to light, and the controversy would have died a-<span class="SpellE">borning</span>. The <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span>’ failure
to undertake such an inquiry precludes their successful invocation of the
character of purchasers in good faith. “(A) want to caution and diligence which
an honest man of ordinary prudence in accustomed to exercise in making
purchases is, in contemplation of law, a want of good faith.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The buyer who could not have failed to know or discover that the land sold to
him was in the adverse possession of another, is a buyer in bad faith, such
knowledge being equivalent to registration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, while the registration of the deed of
acquisition of the lots in question (Numbered 3 and 9) under Act No. 3344 could
not and never operated to bind the land, or third persons,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">bona fides</i> of that purchase by <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco’s parents and by their predecessor has
not at all been put at issue, nor the fact of the <span class="SpellE">Franciscos</span>’
possession of said two lots for more than thirty (30) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that not being buyers in good faith as regards
said Lots Numbered 3 and 9, the <span class="SpellE">Espiritus</span> cannot set
up their certificate of title to defeat the adverse claim thereto of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> Francisco whose good faith, in contrast, and that
of his predecessors, is not and has not been placed in question.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
