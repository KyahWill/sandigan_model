				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 913, filed by <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span>
O. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> Cruz Te and Rene Te against Juan <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, Romeo R. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, William Lopez and
Ernesto Yap, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tagum</span> Branch I, rendered a decision dated October 8, 1979,
declaring the defendants the owners of the <span style="">three disputed lots and ordering that they be placed in possession
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants, as the winning parties, filed a motion for
execution pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was granted
by the lower court in its orders of November 5 and 9, 1979 on condition that
they should file a bond in the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a separate order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1979</st1:date> the lower court
approved plaintiffs' record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the order of execution pending appeal,
plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> O. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span>
Cruz Te and Rene Te filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> dated <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1979</st1:date> wherein they
prayed that that order be annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">That petition was to be filed in the <u>Court of Appeals</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name of that Court is in the heading of
the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it was
inadvertently filed with <u>this Court </u>and docketed as G. R No. 52461 on <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1980</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 a.m.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">After the error was discovered, one original of the petition and
some copies were filed in the Court of Appeals where it was docketed also <span class="GramE">on</span> <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2"><u>February 5,
 1980</u></st1:date><u> as CA-G. R. No. SP-10355</u> and assigned to the
Seventh Division (<span class="SpellE">Escolin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, <u>JJ</u>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as another original of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
was already stitched to the <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of SC-G. R. No.
52461, we issued a resolution on <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1980</st1:date> <u>transferring that <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span></u> to
the Court of Appeals where it was docketed on <st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="2"><u>February 27, 1980</u></st1:date> as CA-G. R. No. <u>SP-10466</u>
and assigned to the <u>Eighth</u> Division (Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>, <u>JJ</u>.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of SC-G.</span>
<span class="GramE">R. No. 52461, which became CA-G.</span> R. No. SP-<span class="GramE">10466,</span> was sent to the Court of Appeals by means of a letter
of transmittal signed by this Court's chief of the judicial records
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Thus, a single petition was
docketed twice</u>, an anomaly which was not seasonably discovered.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the submission of a comment and memoranda, the <u>Seventh
Division</u> in a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="11"><u>November 12, 1980</u></st1:date> nullified the execution pending
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents Juan <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, et al., the
defeated parties in the <i>certiorari</i> case (the winning parties in the
lower court and the petitioners in the instant case), filed a motion for
reconsideration <span style="">through lawyer Mario M.
<span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> who called the Seventh Division's attention
to the fact that a similar <i>certiorari</i> case, CA-G. R. No. <u>SP-<span class="GramE">10466,</span></u> was decided by the <u>Eighth Division</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He attached to his motion a copy of Justice <span class="SpellE">Coquia's</span> decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> of the Seventh Division
denied the motion for reconsideration in a resolution promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="3"><span style="">March
 13, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That decision was appealed to this Court but because the petition
for review on <i>certiorari</i> was filed late, it was denied in the resolution
of <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1981</st1:date> in <u>G.R.
No. 56572</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion dated July 26
for the reconsideration of the minute denial resolution is <u>pending</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Eighth Division issued summons and a
restraining order and required the respondents to comment on the petition in
CA-G. R. No. <span class="GramE"><u>SP-10466</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies of the summons, restraining order and
the resolution to comment were served upon petitioners' counsel, Simeon N. <span class="SpellE">Millan</span>, Jr. Had <span class="SpellE">Millan</span> been more
observant and percipient, he would have noticed that his petition had been <u>docketed
twice</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did not perceive the
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the respondents, he did
nothing about it.</p>

<p class="BODY">No comment was ever submitted by the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Eighth Division, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span>, in a decision promulgated on <u>November 7, 1980</u>
(the decision of the Seventh Division was promulgated on <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="11"><u>November 12, 1980</u></st1:date>) also nullified the
execution pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, the counsel of the respondents
(now petitioners Juan <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, et al.), filed a motion
for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="12">December
 19, 1980</st1:date> wherein he called the Division's attention to the fact
that the petition in the case, CA-G. R. No. <u>SP-<span class="GramE">10466,</span></u>
is a <u>duplication</u> of the petition in CA-G.R. No. No. <u>10355</u> decided
by Justice <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> of the <u>Seventh Division</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> prayed for the dismissal of the
petition and asked that lawyer <span class="SpellE">Millan</span> be declared in
contempt of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Eighth Division
(per Justice <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span>) in its resolution of June 10,
1981 denied the motion and did not bother to straighten out the anomaly that <u>two
decisions were rendered by two Divisions on the same petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</u></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1981</st1:date>,
lawyer <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> filed in this Court a petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i> wherein he prayed that the decision of the Eighth
Division be reversed and set aside and that the execution pending appeal be
upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(G. R. No. 57481).</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Seventh and Eighth Divisions (assuming that the
petition in G. R. No. 56572 was filed on time) did not err in sustaining the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and in annulling the execution pending
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration
in G. R. No. 56572 is denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the two petitions for review are
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Division of the Court of
Appeals to which <u>the appeal in the main case</u> is assigned should decide
that appeal as soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Clerk of Court of the Court of Appeals is directed to call the Division's
attention to the urgency of resolving the appeal with the least delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
