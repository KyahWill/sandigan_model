<p class="BODY">This Court has held in the case of <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Paco</u></span>, <u>supra</u>:</p>

<blockquote>"Drug-pushing when done on a small level as in this case
belongs to that class of crimes that nay <span class="GramE">be</span> committed
at anytime and at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">any place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the offer to buy is accepted and the
exchange is made, the illegal transaction is completed in a few minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the parties are in a public
place and in the presence of other people may not always discourage them from
pursuing their illegal trade as these factors may even serve to camouflage the
same."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant next argues that it is not a common experience that
a drug pusher would unhesitatingly make an illicit transaction with a person he
was meeting for the first time and in full view of his neighbors.</p>

the fact that pro­hibited drugs were being sold as people will <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">not usually mind dealings where there is no
