<p class="BODY">Some five months before the filing of the suit, or more precisely
on <st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1979</st1:date>, those
propeller pieces had been seized by METROCOM agents from <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sosuan</span> on the strength of a search warrant issued by <i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">another </span>branch</u></i> of the same
Manila Court of First Instance, presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maceren</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The search warrant was issued at the instance of <span class="SpellE">Vlasons</span>
Enterprises Corporation (hereafter simply referred to as <span class="SpellE">Vlasons</span>),
which claimed to be the owner of the propeller.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Vlasons</span> alleged that the propeller was an
accessory of an oil tanker (the "MT <span class="SpellE">Feoso</span> Sun)
which it had purchased on December 21, 1978 and which had sunk at a point off <span class="SpellE">Limay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>; that some chains
and the spare bronze propeller of the vessel had been stolen by a certain <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span>; that the propeller, had been traced to a junk shop
of a man named Garcia in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, and when discovered, appeared to have been
broken into two (2) pieces; and that the propeller pieces had been subsequently
sold for P71,000.00 to Kim Hoc <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> Foundry at <span class="SpellE">Jaboneros</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>,
Manila, owned by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sosuan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the METROCOM officers had taken custody of the propeller
pieces, they filed with the Office of the Manila City Fiscal a complaint
accusing Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> and Ernesto Valenzuela of
theft of said propeller.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> They also
filed a second complaint<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a> charging <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sosuan</span> with violation
of the Anti-Fencing Law<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a> for
having allegedly purchased the propeller pieces from Lo Bu, a scrap dealer,
with knowledge that they were stolen goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those complaints were however dismissed by the Fiscal on <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1981</st1:date>, for insufficiency of
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
action was in due course affirmed by the Minister of Justice on <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1981</st1:date>, who also denied <span class="SpellE">Vlason's</span> motion for reconsideration on <st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A final attempt by <span class="SpellE">Vlasons</span> to overturn those
resolutions of dismissal by <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>petitions presented before this Court

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, in the civil action to recover possession of the
propeller pieces filed by <span class="SpellE">Sosuan</span>, pending before
Judge Cruz' Branch, the order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">mentioned
in </span>the opening paragraph of this opinion -- authorizing <span class="SpellE">Sosuan</span> to take possession of the propellers pending action
-- was promulgated on March 22, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Order stressed "the fact that <i>no criminal </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">action has been filed </span>in Court </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in connection with the seizure of the

(2) pieces of scrap bronze propellers, which the former seized from the latter
last June 21, 1979, by virtue of a Search Warrant No. 8578 upon plaintiffs
posting a bond in the amount of P82,940.00 to answer for any damages that might
be caused the defendants and/or Third Party Defendant and/or Alternative
Defendant by reason of the Issuance of this order."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">This Order was also challenged by <span class="SpellE">Vlasons</span> in the Court of Appeals on <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

nullify the order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its judgment dated
July 30, 1982,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">6</span></span></a> it declined to sustain <span class="SpellE">Vlason's</span> theory -- that Judge Cruz had no power to
authorize the release of the propeller pieces because these articles were in <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">custodia</span></i></span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>of another Branch of the Court,
presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Marceren</span>; and that in
authorizing the release thereof, Judge Cruz had interfered with the
jurisdiction and prerogative of a co-equal court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the Court of Appeals, Rule 126
of the Rules of Court does not provide that things seized under a search
warrant could be released only by the court issuing the warrant; that the articles
were not in fact in the custody of the court but of the authorities at Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; and no
criminal case had been filed in the <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sala</span></i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>of Judge <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> involving the
articles in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Vlasons</span> has come to this Court on
appeal by <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>to attempt to bring about a reversal

appeal was given due course by Resolution dated <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceeding for the seizure of property in virtue of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>search warrant does not end with the
actual taking of the property by the proper officers and its delivery, usually
constructive, to the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order
for the issuance of the warrant is not a final one and cannot constitute <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">res</span></i></span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> judicata</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">2</span></span></a> Such an order does not ascertain
and adjudicate the permanent status or character of the seized property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By its very nature, it is provisional,
interlocutory.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a> It is merely the first step in
the process to determine the character and title of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That determination is done in the criminal
action involving the crime or crimes in connection with which the search
warrant was issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, such a
criminal action should be <span class="GramE">prosecuted,</span> or commenced if
not yet instituted, and prosecuted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
outcome of the criminal action will dictate the disposition of the seized property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b>If found to be contraband</b>, i.e.,
articles the possession of which, without more, constitutes a crime and the
repossession of which would subject defendant to criminal penalties and
frustrate the express policy against the possession of such objects, they will
not be returned, but shall be confiscated in favor of the State or destroyed,
as the case may be.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">4</span></span></a> <b>If not

stakeholder,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> although there is authority to
the effect that a magistrate issuing a search warrant on the ground that
property has been stolen has jurisdiction to dispose of the property seized <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, even if there be no criminal prosecution for
the larceny, where the applicable statute does not require a prosecution as a
condition precedent to such disposition,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">but </span>that this jurisdiction is an
exceptional one.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, no criminal prosecution was ever instituted
in the <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> Branch of the Manila Court of First
Instance with respect to the propeller pieces, subsequent to the issuance by
said Branch of a search warrant and the resultant seizure of those
articles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor could any criminal
prosecution ever be expected at any time thereafter since both the fiscal and
the Minister of Justice had opined that no crime had been proven to have
attended the acquisition by the suspects of the propeller pieces, an opinion
which this Court had refused to nullify.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the property could not be permitted to stay in
a perpetual state of <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">custodia</span></i></span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Not being contraband, and not having
been shown to be subject of any crime, it clearly should have been returned,
under normal circumstances, to its rightful owner, or at least to the person
from whom the property had been seized under the warrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That return was however precluded by the
existence of conflicting claims of title over the property being asserted by
two different persons, a conflict that obviously could not be summarily
disposed of by the <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> Branch, but indeed called
for a formal judicial inquiry and adjudication, with full opportunity for
submission of evidence by the contending parties; i.e., an ordinary civil
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the record shows that that civil action was indeed commenced
by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sosuan</span>; but as
fate would have it, it was raffled to another branch of <span class="SpellE">of</span>
the same Manila Court of First Instance, the Cruz Branch, not the <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> Branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
first question that arises in view of this development is whether or not the
Cruz Branch had jurisdiction over this particular action for the recovery of
title to the personal property in question valued at more than twenty thousand
pesos; and the answer cannot but be in the affirmative, in the light of the
clear provisions of the law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">4</span></span></a> The <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> Branch, on the other hand, could not take
cognizance of the issue of title for the simple reason that the action
regarding that issue had not been raffled to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The situation would of course have been less
complicated had the case had been assigned by raffle to the <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span>
Branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even had this transpired,
the <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> Branch would still have been obligated to
conduct a full-dress trial in order to finally resolve the question of title to
the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could not make any
disposition of the property merely because it had earlier issued a search
warrant <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, or on the basis merely of the
evidence adduced in support of the application for the warrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact of the matter is that absent any
contemporaneous or subsequent criminal action involving the crime or crimes for
which the search warrant had been issued, and specially in the light of the
dismissal of the criminal complaints in connection therewith, said search
warrant and the proceedings thereon were rendered inconsequential as far as the
resolution of the civil action involving the conflicting claims of title to the
property was concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question of
title would have to be adjudged principally on the basis of the pleadings filed
and the evidence adduced in that civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">These premises considered, it is therefore immaterial which court
takes cognizance of that civil suit, whether it <span class="GramE">be</span> the
court issuing the search warrant or any other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After all, the former performs in this situation the function of no more
than a custodian of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
peculiar or additional competence to adjudicate the question of title was
acquired by it by reason of its having issued a search warrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No possible inconsistency or contradiction in
disposition of the property could in the circumstances possibly arise between
it and the court where the civil action is pending, since only the latter could
and would render a judgment on the question of title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore no reason to declare the
court which issued the search warrant to be the only branch which should
exercise jurisdiction over the suit to resolve conflicting claims of ownership
over the seized articles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor may any
valid reason be cited why, under the peculiar circumstances obtaining in this
case, the seizing court may not release the seized articles to the person
pronounced by the final judgment in the civil action to be entitled thereto, or
even to transfer the custody of the goods to the branch where the action is
pending, upon due application, at any time prior to final judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not unmindful of its earlier ruling in 1967, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Pagkalinawan</i></span> <i>v. Gomez</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the effect that -</p>

<blockquote>" * * .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The moment a
court of first instance has been informed through the filing of an appropriate
pleading that a search warrant has been issued by another court of first instance,
it cannot, even if the literal language of the Rules of Court (Section 3, Rule
60) yield<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>a contrary impression
which in this case demonstrated the good faith of respondent Judge for acting
as he did, require a sheriff or any proper officer of the Court to take the
property subject of the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> action if
theretofore it came into custody of another public officer by virtue of a
search warrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the court of first
instance that issued such a search warrant may order its release.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any other view would be subversive of a
doctrine that has been steadfastly adhered to, the main purpose of which is to
assure stability and consistency in judicial actuations and to avoid confusion
that may otherwise ensue if courts of coordinate jurisdiction are permitted to
interfere with each other's lawful orders.</blockquote>

<blockquote>" * * . The remedy for questioning the validity of a search
warrant may be sought in the Court of First Instance that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">issued it, not i</span>n <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">sala</span></i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">At once apparent however is that the situation in <span class="SpellE"><i>Pagkalinawan</i></span> is quite distinct from that obtaining
in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><i>Pagkalinawan</i></span>, the same property was being seized at
the same time by different courts upon different writs:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>one by search warrant, the other by writ of
seizure issued in a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was then a palpable and real conflict
in jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the <span class="SpellE"><i>Pagkalinawan</i></span> ruling was laid down precisely to avoid
that conflict in jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, however, since it was fairly certain that no criminal action
could possibly ensue subsequent to or in connection with the search warrant, no
such conflict in jurisdiction or in the ultimate disposition of the seized
property could be expected to arise.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore this Court's holding that where <span class="SpellE">personalty</span> has been seized under a search warrant, and it
appears reasonably definite that the seizure will not be followed by the filing
of any criminal action for the prosecution of the offenses in connection with
which the warrant was issued, the public prosecutors having pronounced the
absence of basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and there are, moreover,
conflicting claims asserted over the seized property, the appropriate remedy is
the institution of a ordinary civil action by any interested party, or of a
special civil action of <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> by the
Government itself, that action being cognizable not exclusively by the court
issuing the search warrant but by any other competent court to which it may be
assigned by raffle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the
seizing court shall transfer custody of the seized articles to the court having
jurisdiction of the civil action at any time, upon due application by any
interested party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But such a transfer,
it must be emphasized, is a matter of comity, founded on pragmatic
considerations, not compellable by or resulting from any overriding authority
of a writ or process of the court having cognizance of the civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second question calling for resolution is the validity of the
Order of Judge Cruz decreeing the transfer to the plaintiff <span class="SpellE"><i>pendente</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">lite</span></i> of the possession of the litigated property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order is obviously designed to grant a temporary, provisional
remedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the slightest reflection

<p class="BODY">The attempt at justification must fail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's thesis is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of any criminal prosecution in
the <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> Branch in relation to the propeller has
no relevance whatever to the question of whether or not in the civil suit
before the Cruz Branch the plaintiff, who claims to be the owner of the

and consequently of any occasion for the <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span>
Court to decide the question of title to the propeller, merely makes necessary
the civil suit to precisely resolve that issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It does not of itself furnish basis for or warrant the transfer of
possession from one party to the other in the civil action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The theory that the act of one branch of a
court of first instance (regional trial court) may be deemed to be the act of
another branch of the same court is, upon its face, absurd.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It flies in the teeth of the all too familiar
actuality that each branch is a distinct and separate court, exercising
jurisdiction over the cases assigned to it to the exclusion of all other
branches.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also patently erroneous is the holding of the Court of Appeals
that "(t)he articles seized were under the custody of Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, and not in
the custody of the Court of First Instance of Manila presided over by Judge
Maceren."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

</span>The officers at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> were not exercising
control over the propeller on their own authority, but by virtue of the power
of the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their custody of the
propeller was obviously and undeniably the custody of the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the lack of any provision in Rule
126 of the Rules of Court ordaining "that the things seized could be
released only by the court issuing the search warrant", also adverted to
by the Court of Appeals,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a> certainly
does not negate the indisputable fact that said court does acquire custody and
control of the property described in the warrant after its seizure, to the
exclusion of any other court; and that that custody and control cannot be
interfered with by any other coordinate court or branch of the same court.</p>

transferring possession of the property in controversy to the plaintiff <span class="SpellE"><i>pendente</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">lite</span></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That relief can be awarded only after trial,
