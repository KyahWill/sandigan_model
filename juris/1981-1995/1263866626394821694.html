<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The view of the
respondent court is that the continuation of the action is necessary for the
purpose of determining the extent of the liability of BF to <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>

that even if such liability is determined, it still cannot be enforced by the
trial court as long as BF is under receivership.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

such determination would not be necessary at all should the rehabilitation
receiver favorably consider and fully acknowledge the claims made by <span class="SpellE">Roa</span> and Mendoza.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Under Sec. 6(d) of P.D.
No. 902-A, the management committee or rehabilitation receiver is empowered to
take custody and control of all existing assets and properties of such
corporations under management; to evaluate the existing assets and liabilities,
earnings and operations of such corporations; to determine </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">best way to salvage and protect the interest
of investors and creditors; to study, review and evaluate the feasibility of
continuing operations and restructure and rehabilitate such entities </span>if
determined to be feasible by the SEC.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In light of these powers,
the reason for suspending actions for claims against the corporation should not
be difficult to discover.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not
really to enable the management committee or the rehabilitation receiver to
substitute the defendant in any pending action against it before any court,
tribunal, board or body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the
real justification is to enable the management committee or rehabilitation
receiver to effectively exercise its/his </span>powers free from any judicial
or extra-judicial interference that might unduly hinder or prevent the
"rescue" of the debtor company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To allow such other action to continue would only add to the burden of
the management committee or rehabilitation receiver, whose time, effort and
resources would be wasted in defending claims against the corporation instead
of being directed toward its restructuring and rehabilitation.</p>
