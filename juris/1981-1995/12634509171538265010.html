of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> convicting the appellant, Emmanuel F. Velasco
of the crime of murder and sentencing him as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Emmanuel Felipe
Velasco y <span class="SpellE">Sarno</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of Murder des­cribed in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appreciating in favor of
the accused the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, which
circumstance is offset by the aggravating circumstance of nighttime, the accused
should be, as he is, hereby sentenced to the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span><u>,</u> with the accessory pe­nalties of
the law; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span>

of P50, 000.00 by way of moral and exemplary damages; and to pay the

<p class="BODY">The appealed judgment is mainly based on appellant's sworn
statement which the trial court considered as an extra-judicial con­fession
perfectly admissible under the Constitution with its strict requirement on the
admissibility of extra-judicial confessions given during custodial
investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the appeal is that the supposed extra-judicial
statement was improperly admitted, and that assuming it to be admissible, it is
insufficient to support conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
its decisive import­ance in the resolution of the issues as above intimated the
statement of appellant must be, as it is hereunder reproduced in full:</p>

<blockquote>"PRELIMINARY STATEMENT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"You are hereby
informed that you are here investigated in connection with a certain case
wherein you were involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q. - Do you
have some knowledge about that incident wherein the driver of an Elite taxi was

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A - Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7. Q. - Will you please narrate to us all what you know
about that incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A - Last March 21,
1978, at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening, I, together with Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> (Agustin <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>) and Ben del Rosario were strolling at Barracks, <span class="SpellE">Mabolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City and not long
after, we agreed that I and Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> will go ahead and
the two Ben will be left behind because they have to go to the house of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> at <span class="SpellE">Cabantan</span> St., Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> then hailed a taxi, an Elite taxi, and then we
boarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was <span class="SpellE">sitted</span>
at the back while Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> was <span class="SpellE">sitted</span>
at the front seat besides the driver and Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
ordered the driver to deliver us to <st1:street><st1:address>M.J. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> Ave.</st1:address></st1:street><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived at San Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaña</span>, at the corner of
the street leading to <span class="SpellE">Casal's</span> Village, Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> ordered the driver to stop the vehicle and pointed a
revolver at the driver and said, "DON'T MOVE'BAY, WE NEED YOUR
VEHICLE" and at this moment, the driver attempted to fight back but was
prevented to by Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> who was a little bigger than
the driver and I was ordered by Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> to be the one
to drive the vehicle and the driver transferred at the back seat and who was at
all times being pointed to by Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> of his
revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was the one who drove the
taxi and from there we went back to Barracks and then we picked-up Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and Ben del Rosario and the two Ben were <span class="SpellE">sitted</span> at the back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> was <span class="SpellE">sitted</span>
at the right side of the driver and Ben del Rosario was at the left side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> agreed to proceed to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Opra</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>
passing thru Capitol Site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on our
way to <span class="SpellE">Opra</span> I saw that Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
also got his revolver and pointed it to the driver and when we arrived at the <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> Station at <span class="SpellE">Escario</span> St.,
the driver attempted to jump (this is the place where the Office of the Elite
taxi is located), and so there-was a commotion at the back and all of a sudden
I heard two shots coming from the revolver of Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
and at this moment we were already ascending to <span class="SpellE">Opra</span>
and I saw the driver leaning at the back seat and was no longer moving and Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> said: "I was hit".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Marina</st1:placename></st1:place>, I stopped the vehicle and
Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, Ben del Rosario and Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> immediately alighted and not long after Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> returned and we ran but we parted our ways and I went
home together with Ben del Rosario at Gil <span class="SpellE">Tudtud</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mabolo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I left Ben
del Rosario at home and I looked for Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and I
found him in the house of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> at <span class="SpellE">Cabantan</span> St. and Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> had a
gunshot wound and was treated by Cesar <span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> and
the ammuni­tion was already removed from his wrist and Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
accompanied me to my house and there I treated his wound again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.Q. - Do you know what happened to the driver which
you left behind inside the taxi at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Marina</st1:placename></st1:place>?</blockquote>

is already dead.</blockquote>

already dead?</blockquote>

that the name of that driver is Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10. Q. - What was your purpose why you brought the
driver and his vehicle to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Opra</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A. - We intend to
get his money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"11. Q. - Were you already aware of that intention at
that time when Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> pointed his revolver at the
driver when you were still at <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaña</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A. - I do not know
about it but I came to know about that when Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
searched the driver about his money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"12. Q. - Do you know already your companions before
that incident on <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1978">March 21, 1978</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A - I know this
Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> for about two weeks and also Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Ben del
Rosario, I know him for quite a long time already because he is a security
guard of my father.</blockquote>

and Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> were armed with a revolver during that
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How about you and Ben del
Rosario, do you have also a revolver at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"14. Q. - Who is the owner of that revolver used by Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A - The one brought by Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
belonged to Rudy <span class="SpellE">Inot</span> and Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
brought his own.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"15. Q. - Why
did you say that the revolver brought by Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
belonged to Rudy <span class="SpellE">Inot</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A </span>- Because a week before that
incident of <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1978">March 21, 1978</st1:date>,
Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and I
were in the house of Rudy <span class="SpellE">Inot</span> at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and while we were in the office of Rudy <span class="SpellE">Inot</span>, I saw
Rudy handed the .30 cal. revolver to Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"16. Q. - That weapon used by Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
in killing the driver was the same weapon given by Rudy <span class="SpellE">Inot</span>?</blockquote>

the time Rudy <span class="SpellE">Inot</span> gave that weapon to Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, I had borrowed many times when we were in the house
and I did not see any weapon of Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> except that
one given by Rudy <span class="SpellE">Inot</span>.</blockquote>

you made before this investigation?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The People's brief also reproduced the entire statement prefacing
it, however, with a narration of facts relevant to the determination of the
question of its admissibility as an extra-judicial confession, which We quote
from said brief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span> was one of the
drivers of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, operator of
"Allied Taxi" at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1978">March
 21, 1978</st1:date>, at or about <st1:time hour="7" minute="0">7:00 a.m.</st1:time>,
<span class="SpellE">Barbado</span> submitted his earning of P90.00 to his
employer at the latter's house at <st1:street><st1:address>100 <span class="SpellE">Escario</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later in the day or about 8:30 p.m., the
taxicab driven by <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span> passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and immediately thereafter <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
who was then outside his house waiting for a ride, heard two shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before he heard the shots, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city> noticed that the
taxicab was being driven recklessly as though the driver was drunk and the rear
left door was open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long thereafter
or at about <st1:time hour="21" minute="0">9:00 p.m.</st1:time>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city> received a call
informing him that <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span> was killed at Marina
Camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to the place and saw <span class="SpellE">Barbado's</span> body lying on the back seat of the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was blood inside the car and a bullet
hole in the driver's seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 3-7, 9,
12-17, 19-20, Hearing of <st1:date year="1978" day="26" month="10">October 26,
 1978</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The case was investigated by Lt. <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span>
Angel of the Police Force of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City after he re­ceived
a dead person alarm at Marina Hill at about <st1:time hour="8" minute="0">8:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1978">March
 21, 1978</st1:date> through a member of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded to the place and
found the body of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span> inside the taxi in
the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lt. Angel contacted
police in­formers and sometime on <st1:date month="3" day="23" year="1978">March
 23, 1978</st1:date>, he received information that one Cesar <span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> extracted a bullet from the hand of a certain Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house of
<span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> at <span class="SpellE">Cabantan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mabolo</span> and the Peter Line Ga­rage where <span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span>
was employed as driver were placed under <span class="SpellE">surveilance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the evening of the same day, <span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> was arrested at the garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Verano</span> who was at
the wheel escaped arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> admitted having extracted a bullet from the hand of
<span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and he men­tioned the names of Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> @ Agustin <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, Ben del Rosario and Emmanuel Velasco as the persons
responsible for the killing of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lt. Angel did not know the persons named by <span class="SpellE">Pelonio</span> except Velasco who resided at <span class="SpellE">Mabolo</span>
and whose father was a <span class="SpellE">compadre</span> of his superior
officer Captain Ruiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contacted the
father of Emmanuel Velasco and advised him to surrender his son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following this advice of Lt. Angel, Velasco's
father surrendered his son at the house of Lt. Angel who then brought Emmanuel
to headquarters so that his statement may be taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ylaya</span> rep­resented Velasco even before the latter gave his
statement to the police and was present at the office of Lt. Angel and at the
house of Velasco (pp. 2-12, 21, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Hearing of <st1:date month="5" day="11" year="1979">May 11, 1979</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The affidavit or statement of Emmanuel Velasco was taken down
by police corporal Romeo Cordova after Velasco was turned over to him by Lt.
Angel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the investigation was
conducted, Cordova informed Velasco of his constitutional rights among others,
to remain silent and to secure a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was also told that anything he said might be used against him and
Velasco offered no ob­jection saying only that he was willing to tell the truth
(pp. 4-7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Hearing of <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1979">April 30, 1979</st1:date>)."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hinting that there was some degree of threats and intimidation in
the giving of his statement and signing it before the swearing officer,
appellant would, however, more strongly rely for the inadmissibility of his
extra-judicial confession, as he contends, an alleged promise of immunity by
making him a state witness and thus impugn the <span class="SpellE">volun­tariness</span>
of the confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The non-attendance of
counsel during its execution is also averred as further ground for its
inadmissibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant listed a number of circumstances which to him would
show lack of free will or spontaneity on his part in giving his statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"First: appellant surrendered on <st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1978">April 1, 1978</st1:date>, yet he was investigated on <st1:date month="4" day="4" year="1978">April 4, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not charged with a crime in court yet
he had to stay under custody for three (3) days before investigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Second: while the investigator admits the investigation to
have been on <st1:date month="4" day="4" year="1978">April 4, 1978</st1:date>,
the statements were sworn 22 days later on <st1:date month="4" day="26" year="1978">April 26, 1978</st1:date> and all the time the appellant continued
to be detained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Third: after the statements were sworn on <st1:date month="4" day="26" year="1978">April 26, 1978</st1:date>, the information was filed more
than a month later on <st1:date month="5" day="29" year="1978">May 29, 1978</st1:date>,
with appellant continuously deprived of his liberty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fourth: while the actual surrender of appellant was on <st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1978">April 1, 1978</st1:date>, the prosecution has not
denied the tes­timony of the appellant that in the police blotter he was
officially entered as having surrendered only on <st1:date month="5" day="26" year="1978">May 26, 1978</st1:date> (Cf. <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-Sept.
18, 1979-p. 100).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fifth: knowing that the appellant was represented by a lawyer
as early as the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> surrender, it sounds
unnatural that such a lawyer would not be called upon to attend the
investigation of the appel­lant by the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Cf. <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-May 11, 1979-p.20).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sixth: that the statements in Exhibit "C" were made
"in consideration" of affiant's becoming a state wit­ness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-May 11, 1979
of Lt. Angel-pp. 21;16-17).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Seventh: while appellant was not mauled before the taking of the
affidavit, there is the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> statement of
the appellant (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-Sept. 18, 1979-p.99) that after
his surrender, nightly he would be threat­ened with bodily harm and before he
was to have signed the statements before State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>,
Pat. Romeo Cordova reminded him of the mauling of Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Petalcorin</span>
to near death, the lot which would befall appellant should he back out from

18, 1979-p.96).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Eighth: there is no statement whatsoever from Lt. Angel or
Romeo Cordova that appellant was made to read the finished typewritten
statements of the latter; on the other hand, the positive declarations of the
appellant that he was in front of the typewriter during the typing of the
affidavit in question-and-answer form and there­fore could not read what was
typed has never been contradicted (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-Sept. 18,
1979-pp. 89-91), nor is there a denial of the testimony of the appellant that
he has not read the typed affidavit from the time it was taken until 22 days
later when sworn before the State Prosecutor (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-Sept.
18, 1979-pp. 92-93).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ninth: before the swearing appellant invited the attention of
the Secretary of the State Prosecutor and Pat. Romeo Cordova that
"some" portions of the affidavit were not appellant's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no rebuttal or contra­diction to
this piece of evidence purporting to show that what appellant declared was not
faithfully recorded or typed by the Investigator (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-Sept.

denied or rebutted, thus it is odd that when the taking of appellant's
statements was held on <st1:date month="4" day="4" year="1978">April 4, 1978</st1:date>,
the same was done without the benefit of counsel's presence."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What is immediately striking from the foregoing circumstances as
set forth in appellant's brief is that there was a mixture of threat and
cajolery employed in the execution of the extra-judicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either or both would vitiate the confession
for lack of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>, the one essential element
for the admissibility of an extra-judicial con­fession, aside, of course, from
the need of attendance of counsel in the execution thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">How does the prosecution try to show that the execution of the
extra-judicial confession was attended with <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>?
We quote from the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief:</p>

<blockquote>"The alleged extra-judicial confession' referred to by
appellant's counsel is Exhibit C (p. 6, folder of Exhibits) which is the
statement given by the accused-appellant to Corporal Romeo Cordova of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Police Department regarding the incidents that
led to the death of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to appellant it was error for the
lower court to admit Exhibit C because it "has been vitiated with
involuntariness and executed without the attendance of counsel.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, appellant admitted in
court his desire to surrender to the authorities and 'to give (his) side to the
police so that the police will be <span class="SpellE">enlighted</span> about the
incident' (p. 121, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1979</st1:date>; pp. 8, 10-11, 13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Hearing
of <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1979</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also iden­tified <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
C as the affidavit he gave on April 4 and sworn to on April 26, 1978 before
State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Benicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>
(pp. 78-79, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Hearing of September 18, 1979; p.
41, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Hearing of September 20, 1979).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also a fact admitted by appellant that
while he was at the <span class="SpellE">Mabolo</span> Police Station for
safekeeping following his surrender, he was not mauled or harmed (p. 99, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, September 18, 1979; pp. 27-28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
September 20, 1979)."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Government counsels, after reproducing in full, appellant's
sworn statement<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
concluded without any explanation that appellant's, claim of involuntariness in
the execution of his sworn statement is with­out merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the conclusion is based on the abundance
of details as set forth in the statement which appellant alone could have
supplied, as the lower court expressly so stated, and the fact that it tends to
be ex­culpatory in the portions appellant gave as his answers (he denied
certain portions as not given by him), We find the conclusions not
well-founded.</p>

<p class="BODY">What was stated in the statement to be the purpose of the hold-up
was to get the money of the driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
appellant, clarifying this matter, stated that he did not know of such an
intention, even when Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> pointed his gun at the
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came to know of it only when
Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> searched the driver about his money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance tends to exclude appellant
from a previous understanding, if any, to rob the driver as to make him a
co-conspirator in the commission of that crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, no robbery was actually committed, and so the charge is
only for murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
quite correctly cited by appellant, this Court had occasion to state:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
other words, the accused must be shown to have had guilty participation in the
criminal design entertained by the slayer, and this presupposes knowledge on
his part of such criminal design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not enough that there be a relation between the acts done by the principal and
those attributed to the person charged as co-principal or accomplice; it is,
further­more, necessary that the latter, with knowledge of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> criminal intent, should cooperate with moral or
material aid in the consummation of the crime."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the killing, it appears abundantly clear that
same was a sudden and unexpected act of Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> and
merely on a likewise sudden, <span class="SpellE">unreflected</span> impulse,
when the driver made a sudden attempt to jump out of the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much so that when Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
suddenly shot at the driver, Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> was also
hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manner the killing happened
would thus seem also to exclude appellant from a previous conspiracy or under­standing
to make him equally liable for the act of Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> who
took it upon himself to shoot at the driver prompted by the unexpected move of
the driver of attempting to jump out of the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no circumstance upon
which to base a finding of appellant participating in the criminal design of
killing the driver, an element considered essential to make one a principal, or
even as a mere accomplice, in the commission of a particular crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony,
appellant also brought out some significant facts that tend to firm up the
conclusion already in­timated earlier that he could not be tagged as a
co-conspirator in the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, appellant, feeling tired begged leave to go ahead from the
party which they attended at Cesar <span class="SpellE">Pelonio's</span>
residence, but Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
and Ben del Rosario accompanied him to the corner for a taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a taxi was hailed, Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> decided to leave with appellant, while Ben <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and Ben del Rosario went back to the party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the taxi at the back seat, appellant felt
very sleepy with heavy eyes, but opened them when the taxi stopped, surprised
to see Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> pointing his gun at the driver and
commanding the latter to transfer to the back seat, appellant to take the
driver's seat and drive the car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's protest against Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho's</span> order
met with <span class="SpellE">Kho’s</span> gun pointed at him.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the killing, appellant stopped the car as if it had run out
of gas, prompting his companions to rush into the darkness, hut appel­lant
stayed behind to wait for the police or someone to come at the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
returned to urge appellant to leave the place for he may only be
"salvaged" by the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant also left, afraid that Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> might
shoot him if he insisted on waiting for the police, but in the dark, he lost
contact with Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He and Ben del Rosario took a PU car from some distance and headed for
the Velasco residence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing acts, as testified to by appellant without rebuttal
or contradiction, would establish the validity of appellant's claim of not
being a conspirator in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy, like the guilt itself for the
crime charged, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Government of course tries to show that appellant's testimo­ny
is not quite believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the fact
that after the shooting, appel­lant and Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> were
together in an island of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> is pointed to as
showing appellant's sharing in the criminal design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> went to
appellant's house to fetch him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant had to go with Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, obviously
under threat, for at the earliest opportunity, he managed by some pretense or
another, to break away from <span class="SpellE">Kho's</span> company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The apparent contradiction in his testimony that he does not
drink because of heart ailment, and that he was driving slowly because he was
under the influence of beer, can be easily explained that he is supposed not to
drink because of his heart ailment, but that on isolated occasion he may take
to beer, which, however, would easily affect him because he is not a drinker.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to why appellant acted too submissively to the orders of Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, which the Government also points to as rendering
appellant's ver­sion unbelievable, considering that appellant had one of his
father's security guard with him, Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> must have <span class="SpellE">drunked</span> unrestrainedly that he was acting with unreasoning
boldness over appellant, himself rendered more easily cowed by a mild drink of
beer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's testimony that although his companions left to escape
when the taxi stopped for lack of fuel, he stayed behind intend­ing to wait for
the police, is, likewise, branded as a mere afterthought, for he had many
opportunities to give himself up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
state counsels forgot that Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> returned to urge
appellant to leave the taxi, and the following morning, he fetched again appellant
from the latter's home from which time Boy <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> kept
appellant always with him until appellant succeeded, by some trick, in breaking
away from <span class="SpellE">Kho's</span> company.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find, notwithstanding the attempt of the prose­cution
to discredit appellant's testimony, which as just demonstrated, is not quite
convincing, that appellant's testimony is worthy of belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of contradictory testimony by a
state witness makes the evidence of the prosecution insufficient to establish
guilt beyond rea­sonable doubt, which thus consists of appellant's supposed
extra­judicial confession which, as presently to be shown, is also inadmis­sible
under the strict standard established by our New Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence, We are constrained to hold that the requirement
of counsel being present during the taking of statement of a suspect in a
custodial investigation, was not fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is evident from the trial court's own statement relevant to this
matter, which the People merely quoted in reliance thereof in meeting appel­lant's
contention that the requirement of attendance of counsel during the taking of
the statement has not been satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.
Defendant's father and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ylaya</span> accompanied the
accused when the accused surrendered to the police authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon such a surrender, the police authorities
could rightfully be assumed to imme­diately question and interrogate the
accused in respect to the murder of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Barbado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
father and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ylaya</span> would leave the accused to his
own devices when questioned by the police is acquies­cent of defendant's giving
out a statement respecting the charge or charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are of the be­lief that the accused was
indeed appraised of his consti­tutional rights under custodial interrogation
but that he averred that he did not wish to avail himself of the services of a
lawyer, to advice or guide him in the making of his statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His lawyer, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ylaya</span>, his father and five of his father's retained
counsel was at defendant's back and call.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What could have been easier for the accused to do than to give a ring by
tele­phone to these lawyers or send a messenger to secure their appearance, had
he felt that he needed one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be
remembered that it was at the initiative of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ylaya</span> that Lt. <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span>
Angel arranged with defendant's father for the surrender of the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the trial court's own observation that there was
no counsel in actual attendance during the taking down of the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court actually found that there was
a waiver on the part of appellant of his right to the assistance of counsel as
required for the admissibility of the statement as an extra­judicial
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no such waiver from
the mere fact that the appellant had lawyers at his beck and call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more reasonable to infer from the
non-attendance of counsel is that ap­pellant was not informed of said specific
right, as he ought to have been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
statement itself shows unequivocally, appellant was allegedly informed of his
constitutional rights, but was not even asked whether he wanted to exercise or
avail himself of such rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a
manifest failure to comply with the constitutional require­ment for the admissibility
of extra-judicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the alleged extra-judicial confession of appellant was
improperly admitted in evidence, resulting in utter lack of support of the
lower court's judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the guilt of appellant not having been
established beyond reasonable doubt, appellant is entitled to an
acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accord­ingly, the judgment
appealed from is hereby reversed and appellant, acquitted, with cost <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1978</st1:date>, the lifeless body of
driver Ricardo Barbado was found in­side his taxicab at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Marina</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placename>Cebu</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sustained two fatal entrance gunshot
wounds in the chest and abdomen and two exit wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bullet holes were found in the upholstery of
the cab, an indication that he was shot therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wallet contained thirty pesos but there
was no money inside the driver's till.</p>

<p class="BODY">A police investigator was apprised by informers that Agustin Kho,
Ben Verano, Ben <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario and Emmanuel F. Velasco
were responsible for the killing of Barbado.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Velasco was surrendered by his father <span style="">and his </span>lawyer, Maximino S. Ylaya, to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velasco gave a written statement to Corporal
Romeo Cordova after he was informed that he had the right to remain silent and
to secure the services of a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco in his confession revealed how the killing was
perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that in the evening
of <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1978</st1:date>, while he
and Kho were strolling at Barracks, Mabolo, <st1:place><st1:placename>Cebu</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Kho hailed a taxi and they
boarded it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velasco sat beside the
driver in the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kho sat in the
backseat.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the taxi reached San Jose de la Montana at the corner of the
street leading to Casal's Village, Kho ordered the driver (Barbado) to stop the
vehicle and then poked a revolver at him and said: "Don't move, Bay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We need your vehicle."</p>

<p class="BODY">The driver tried to fight back but Kho subdued him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was directed to transfer to the
backseat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kho kept the revolver pointed
at the driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kho ordered Velasco to
drive the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velasco drove the taxi
back to Barracks where he picked up Verano and Del Rosario who sat at the
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taxi proceeded to <st1:place><st1:placename>Opra</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verano also pointed his revolver at Barbado.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the taxi arrived at the Caltex gas station on <st1:street><st1:address>Escario
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, where the office of the taxicab was
located, Barbado attempted to jump out of the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that juncture, Kho fired two shots at
Barbado.</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco stopped the taxi at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Marina</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velasco and Del Rosario went home at Gil
Tudtud, Mabolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verano went to the home
of Cesar Pelonio at <st1:street><st1:address>Cabantan Street</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Police Lieutenant Domiciano R. Angel testified that Velasco was <u>represented
by lawyer M. S. Ylaya,</u> who re­sided in the Velasco compound <span class="GramE">and</span> is a <u>compadre</u> of Velasco's father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was Ylaya who advised the police to
negotiate with <span class="GramE">Velasco' s</span> father for his surrender.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the witness stand, Velasco gave a version substan­tially
similar to that found in his extrajudicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court took this fact into
consideration in convicting Velasco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
declared that he and Kho were riding in the taxicab of Barbado in the evening
of <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kho was in the front seat while Velasco was
in the backseat where he snoozed.</p>

<p class="BODY">He was suddenly awakened when he heard Kho telling the driver to
stop the cab and he (Velasco) thought that he had arrived at his
destination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw Kho pointing his
revolver at the driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kho ordered the
driver to transfer to the back-seat and directed Velasco to drive the cab.</p>

<p class="BODY">He drove the cab to <st1:street><st1:address>Cabantan Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kho saw Del Rosario and Verano walking
towards a sari-sari store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kho whistled
at the two and they boarded the cab.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After Kho and Verano had conversed in the dialect, Velasco, as
instructed by Kho, drove the taxi to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Opra</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verano searched the pockets of Barbado.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the taxi reached the gas station on <st1:street><st1:address>Escario
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Velasco heard a scuffle in the backseat
and then he saw Kho shooting Barbado twice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Velasco wanted to stop the cab but Kho ordered him to continue
driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He drove the taxi to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Marina</st1:placename></st1:place> and told his companions that
the taxi had run out of gas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left
the taxi and separated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco passed through the bushes in the field and met Del
Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took a PU car near the
Taoist temple and went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not
reveal the incident to the police because Kho warned him that if he squealed he
and the members of his family would be killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco and Kho left <st1:place><st1:placename>Cebu</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and fled to the islands near <st1:place>Bohol</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They returned to <st1:place><st1:placename>Cebu</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Velasco separated from Kho and returned home where his father told him
to surrender to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already
stated, he executed a confession which was sworn to before District State
Prosecutor Benicio L. Arzadon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco, who finished the third year of the commerce course, said
that he was induced to make the confession because of the assurance by the
police that he would be utilized as a State witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he was conversant with the
constitutional provision regarding the admissibility of extra­judicial
confessions.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that he was told by the police that <span style="">Ylaya, the lawyer of his </span>father, had
read his confession and had found it to be all right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ylaya is Velasco's godfather, being a sponsor
at Velasco's wedding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ylaya testified
that at the time Velasco was surrendered to the police he, (Ylaya) in­formed
Lieutenant Angel that he (Ylaya) was Velasco's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Indeed,
Ylaya </span>was Velasco's counsel at his arraignment and trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Velasco' <span style="">s</span></span><span style=""> </span>extrajudicial
confession is admissible under section 20, Article IV of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He waived his rights not to incriminate
himself, to be silent and to be assisted by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During custodial interrogation, he could have
availed himself of the services of his godfather, lawyer Ylaya, and of the five
lawyers of his father in the latter's mining, real estate and foundry
businesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velasco did not secure their
services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco is a well-educated and intelligent person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave his confession voluntarily and
without any outside pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
corroborated by evidence of the <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> <u>delicti.<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The charge against Velasco and his companions is murder qualified
by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His three companions were
not brought to trial because they have not been arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although robbery was intended, robbery was
not included in the indictment because the prosecution had no evidence to prove
that robbery was actually committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main evidence against Velasco is his own confession which was
confirmed by his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do his
confession and testimony prove the commission of murder?</p>

<p class="BODY">A casual perusal of his confession and testimony dis­closes that
the killing of Barbado was not attended with treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
killing was not </span>deliberate and <span style="">pre
conceived nor was </span>it a complete <span style="">surprise
</span>to the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two revolvers were
pointed at the victim during the time that he was in the backseat of the
taxicab.</p>

<p class="BODY">The intention of the four malefactors (including Velasco) was to
rob him and to enable <span class="GramE">themselves</span> to use the
taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing was-made upon the
spur of the moment and was triggered by Barbado's attempt to jump out of the
taxi and escape from his captors.</p>

<p class="BODY">So, the killing cannot be qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was abuse of superiority but this
circumstance was not alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a qualifying circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing is homicide aggravated by abuse
of superiority and use of a motor vehicle and mitigated by voluntary surrender
to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Can Velasco be regarded as a co-conspirator in the killing on the
basis of his confession and testimony which are the only pieces of evidence
against him?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record does not show that
Velasco conspired with Kho, Verano and Del Rosario to kill Barbado.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But his act of driving the taxicab with the knowledge that in the
backseat Kho was pointing his revolver at Barbado and that later Verano was
also poking his gun at Barbado is suffi­cient to implicate him as an <u><span style="">accomplice</span></u><span style=""> </span>in the homicide and to prove his community of design with his
companions to in­flict some wrong on Barbado.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He knew that at any moment his companions might kill Barbado and yet, in
spite of that know­ledge, he continued driving the taxicab.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am of the opinion that Velasco should be convicted as an
accomplice in the homicide and sentenced to an indetermi­nate penalty of six
years of <u><span style="">prision</span></u><span style=""> <u>correctional</u></span> as minimum to
eleven years of <u><span style="">prision</span></u><span style=""> <u>mayor</u> </span>as maximum and to pay <span style="">an </span>indemnity of six thousand pesos to
the heirs of Barbado.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur because:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">In respect to the violation of the constitutional right of the accused
to counsel when his 'supposed confession was taken by the police, it has always
been my position that to comply with the substantial import of Section 20 of
the Bill of Rights, it is not enough for the investigator to just inform the
person concerned of his right and then ask him if he is willing to give his
statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I maintain that to give bone
and muscle to the constitutional right under discussion, it must specifically
be shown that before the questioning was started, the detained person had been
asked whether or not he wanted to avail of the right to counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am aware that </span><span style="">the Constitution is pertinently worded thus:
"Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall
have the right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such
right." To my mind, the essence of this provision is not simply that the
person under custody be informed but that he should be given the chance to
exercise that right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Merely informing
him of the right to counsel without asking him if he wishes to exercise the
right <span style="">is in </span>my considered
opinion to pay no more than lip service to the substantial right contemplated
therein. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>To be sure every man may be
presumed to know, as a rule, the law and the constitution, but unless he is
asked if he desires to exercise his right under them, <span style="">I </span>cannot be satisfied that the wholesome intent of the charter's
guarantee of fairness and justice can be satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I agree, therefore, that the confession of
appellant Velasco in this case should not be taken into account.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR"><span style="">Assuming for the sake of argument that such confes­sion may be
considered, my conscience cannot lie easy on the </span>conviction that
Velasco's acts related to the purported robbery and unexpected shooting of
Barbado as revealed in said confes­sion could render him liable even as an
accomplice in the crime committed by his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, in his statement he said that their
purpose in taking Barbado and his vehicle to </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Opra</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place> was "to get his
money," but as, in fact, no getting of money took place, such statement is
insignificant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he continued to
drive the taxi despite his seeing that Kho and Verano were pointing their guns at
Barbado may be attributed to the fact that Kho practically threatened him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, if indeed, Kho and Verano intended
to rob Barbado of his money, the fact that Velasco saw them pointing their guns
at Barbado does not necessarily mean that Barbado was going to be hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Kho shot him only because he jumped
out of the vehicle unexpectedly.</p>
