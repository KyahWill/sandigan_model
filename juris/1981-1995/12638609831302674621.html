				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Alleging grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of
jurisdiction, petitioners numbering 170 in all, assail the Decision of the
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC Case No. 402-LR-XI-81 (LRD
Case No. STF-314-78) entitled "Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Olacao</span>,
et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., vs. <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>
Development Enterprises, et al.," promulgated on 18 September 1987,
setting aside the Decision of Labor Arbiter Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Libron</span>
awarding separation pay to petitioners, and sustaining, instead, private
respondents’ appeal on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> or bar by prior judgment (Annex
"A", Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">The following background facts, arranged chronologically, will
put the controversy in proper perspective:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Petitioners were the former workers of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development Enterprises, <span class="GramE">then</span>
a single proprietorship, owned, operated and managed by respondents Spouses <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leodegaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> and
Miriam <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>
("<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>," for brevity).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It operated a logging concession at <span class="SpellE">Kinablangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental (p. 233, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">a) On <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="11">28 November 1977</st1:date>,
petitioners filed with the then Ministry of Labor, Region XI, a complaint for <u>non-payment
of wages and emergency living allowance</u> (LRD Case No. ROXI-MC-857-77)
entitled "<span class="SpellE">Olacao</span> and 189 others vs. <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development Enterprises, Inc." The Complaint
was later certified to the Labor Arbitration Branch of the NLRC and docketed as
NLRC Case No. 897-MC-XI-78 (hereinafter, the "Unpaid Wages Case").</p>

<p class="BODY">b) In December, 1977, "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>"
decided to totally and permanently close its business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on 5 December 1977, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, the Executive Vice-president and General Manager,
filed an application with the Regional Director of the then Ministry of Labor
to formally close its business on account of business reverses (Annex
"C-2," Petition, p. 167, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This application was favorably acted upon on <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="12">15 December 1977</st1:date> by the Regional
Director of the Ministry of Labor, Regional Office No. XI, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
on condition that "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>" should pay
all unpaid wages and separation pay of all its employees (Annex
"C-3," ibid. p. 168, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">c) On <st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="1">5 January 1978</st1:date>
the owners of "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>" sold all their
shareholdings to private respondent, George Q. Choy, and the company was
thereafter known as <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development Enterprises,
Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">("<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>, Inc.," for short).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">d) On <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="1">21 January 1978</st1:date>,
"<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Inc.," under a new management,
paid its 381 employees including petitioners herein, all their unpaid wages,
living allowances, overtime pay and all other benefits due them <u>and </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">termination </span>pay</u>, computed up to <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="11">30 November 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon receiving said payments, petitioners
signed sworn individual documents entitled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">"Receipt </span>and Release" whereby they:</p>

<blockquote>"absolutely and forever release <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">and discharge the </span><span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>
Development Enterprises, its successors and assigns, of any and all claims and
liabilities whatsoever insofar as my past salaries/wages, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">termination pay</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, overtime pay and other privileges accorded
me by law and/or any other claims are concerned" (Annex "C-4",
Petition, p. 169, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">e) On <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="5">30 May 1980</st1:date>,
Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> T. Reyes dismissed the
"Unpaid Wages Case" (NLRC Case No. 897-MC-XI-78) for lack of merit
and for being moot and academic in view of the "Receipt and Release"
documents executed by the complainant-workers.<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">f) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="9">30 September 1982</st1:date>, the appeal interposed by
petitioners to the NLRC was dismissed by its First Division, stating in part:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful review of the entire record, we find no
justification for disturbing the Labor Arbiter's findings and conclusions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In our own view, the payment of the amounts
stated in the deeds above referred to has rendered to (sic) this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">case academic because the receipt by the
complainants of the said amounts is an established fact and there is no showing
that their execution of the said documents was tainted by anything that
vitiates free consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is
difficult to believe that more than 300 people could at the same time be forced
to execute the same against their will." (p. 2, Decision, p. 240, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">2. In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="11">27
 November 1978</st1:date>, petitioners filed another Complaint against "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>," Inc. this time for <u>Illegal Dismissal</u>
(LRD Case No. <span class="GramE">STF-314-78) with the Regional Office No.</span>
<span class="GramE">XI, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Davao</span></span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE">, of the
then Ministry of Labor.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
prayed for "reinstatement <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from the date of the illegal </span>dismissal." The Complaint was later on
certified to the Arbitration Branch and docketed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">as NLRC Case No. 402-LR-XI-81 </span>(the "Illegal Dismissal"
Case).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">a) In its Answer (Annex "C", Petition), "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>, Inc.," denied that it had dismissed
petitioners illegally inasmuch as the total closure of its establishment was
with prior clearance of the Regional Director of Labor, Region XI, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, and that pursuant to the latter's Order of 15
December 1977, its employees including complainants, were fully compensated
"all unpaid wages earned and separation pay equivalent to 15 days for
every year of service." <span class="GramE">As proof thereof, attached to
the Answer was the "Receipt and Release" sworn to by petitioner
Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Olacao</span> (Annex "C-4").</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">b) On <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="4">21 April 1980</st1:date>
"<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>, Inc." filed a Manifestation in
the "Illegal Dismissal Case" to the effect that the "Unpaid
Wages Case" was still pending, and that "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>
Development Enterprises" and <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>
Development Enterprises, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> are two different
entities (p. 3, Manifestation, p. 196 <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">c) At that point in time, it appears that the "Unpaid Wages
Case" was still on appeal with the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">d) On <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="7">30 July 1981</st1:date>,
petitioners filed an Amended Complaint in the "Illegal Dismissal
Case," <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> as additional respondents
spouses <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leodegaria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>,
Miriam <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Sons Management Corporation, <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development Enterprises, Inc., and George Q. Choy
(Annex "L", p. 203, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Amended Complaint alleged that the <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> respondents connived with one another in entering
into a fictitious contract of transferring the ownership of "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>" to George Q. Choy to effect the illegal
dismissal of petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, all of
them should be considered jointly and severally liable for the acts complained
of.</p>

<p class="BODY">e) The newly <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> private
respondents all denied liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its
own Answer, filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="8">19 August 1981</st1:date>,
"<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>, Inc." denied any connivance
with them in the dismissal of complainants (Annex "O", p. 215, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">f) In the interim, the timber license of <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>,
Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> was cancelled and since then up to the present
it has completely ceased operations (Memorandum for Private Respondent, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pp. </span>4 and 8).</p>

<p class="BODY">g) On <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="5">20 May 1986</st1:date>,
the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch, Branch XI, through Labor Arbiter Jose Q. <span class="SpellE">Libron</span>, rendered a Decision in the "Illegal Dismissal
Case," dismissing the charge of illegal dismissal for lack of merit and
awarding separation pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"CONFORMABLY WITH THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1) Dismissing the charge of illegal dismissal for lack of merit,
thus denying the prayer for reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) Ordering respondents <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>

Management Corporation, <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development
Enterprises, Inc., and George Q. Choy to pay jointly and severally the 170
complainants their <u>separation pay</u> equivalent to one month pay per year
of service.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

"Q", pp. 228-229, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) (Underscoring

<p class="BODY">h) On <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="7">2 July 1986</st1:date>,
private respondent received copy of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Libron's</span>
Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">i</span>)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On 14 July 1986, private respondents filed their Notice of Appeal and

dismissing the case because payments of wages had already been made; and (2)
the NLRC Decision on appeal (NLRC Case No. 897-MC-XI-78), promulgated on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="9">30 September 1982</st1:date>, affirming Labor

<p class="BODY">j) Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied,
they availed of the present Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, filed on <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="1">23 January 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="1">23 January 1989</st1:date>,
we resolved to give due course and required the submittal of memoranda, the
last of which was filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="6">5 June 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue for resolution is whether or not the NLRC
gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in reversing
Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Libron's</span> Decision on the principal
ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, joined by the Solicitor General, fault the NLRC with
grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC and
private respondents, on the other hand, negate the charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">We uphold the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">In actual fact, the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
"Unpaid Wages Case" (NLRC Case No. 897-MC-XI-78) was not raised for
the first time when the "Illegal Dismissal Case" was appealed to the
NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, on 21 April 1980, before the
Decision was rendered in the "Unpaid Wages Case," "<span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>" had filed a Manifestation in the
"Illegal Dismissal Case," calling attention to the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the "Unpaid Wages Case" "filed
sometime in the last quarter of 1977" and verified by one of the
petitioners herein Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Olacao</span> (Annex
"J", Petition).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for

Answer (Annex "D", ibid.) in the "Illegal Dismissal Case,"
it made specific reference to the "Receipt and Release" individually
executed by petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should have
been no surprise to complainants, therefore, when that matter was invoked on
appeal before the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the
NLRC is empowered to take judicial notice of its own pronouncements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, at the time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">said

which Decision was affirmed by the NLRC, First <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

rightfully invoke the Decision in the "Unpaid Wages Case" and the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> thereof by the First Division of the NLRC in

same in its Answer, which it <span class="GramE">filed only</span> on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">19

</span>But even then, it had alleged in its original Answer that "in

allowances and other benefits granted by the New <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Labor Code of the Philippines and other applicable Presidential
Decrees."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the NLRC
for concluding that from the said Decisions, the issue of termination pay had
already been passed upon and resolved; in other words, a clear case of '<span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>' or bar by former
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC found that
complainants had already been paid their several money claims including their
termination pay (p. 4, NLRC Resolution, September 19, 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parties ought not to be permitted to litigate
an issue more than once (Eternal Gardens Memorial Parks Corp. vs. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 73794, 19 September 1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Decisions in the "Unpaid Wages Case" legally and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">finally settled the question of separation
pay </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">But petitioners claim
that the causes of action in the two cases were different - in the "Unpaid
Wages Case", </span>money claims were involved; in the "Illegal
Dismissal Case," petitioners challenged their termination from employment.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The difference, however, appears only on
the surface.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In essence, because
petitioners claimed that they had been illegally dismissed, they prayed for
"full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the date of illegal
dismissal." In fact, it was separation pay that was awarded to them in
Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Libron's</span> Decision in the "Illegal
Dismissal Case," who found that "complainants' termination was
effected on a valid ground authorized by law, but considering that termination
and closure was effected without prior clearance x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> complainants should be granted separation pay" (p. 7
Decision).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge of illegal
dismissal was dismissed for lack of merit and complainants’ prayer for
reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> was denied (p. 12,
ibid.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further contend that their acceptance of separation
pay does not operate as a waiver of their claims in the "Illegal Dismissal
Case." Indeed, jurisprudence exists to the effect that a deed of release
or quitclaim cannot bar an employee from demanding benefits to which he is legally
entitled (Fuentes vs. NLRC, G. R. No. 76835, November 24, 1988); that
quitclaims and/or complete releases executed by the employees do not <span class="SpellE">estop</span> them from pursuing their claim arising from the
unfair labor practice of the employer (Garcia vs. NLRC, G.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>R. No. 67825, September 4, 1987, 153 SCRA
639); and that employees who received their separation pay are not barred from
contesting the legality of their dismissal and that the acceptance of those
benefits would not amount to <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> (Mercury Drug
Co., Inc. vs. Court of Industrial Relations, G. R. No. 23357, April 30, 1974,
56 SCRA 694):<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>De Leon vs. NLRC, G. R.
No. 52056, October 30, 1980, 100 SCRA 691).</p>

<p class="BODY">A telling difference from the cited cases, however, is the fact
that the issue of the validity of the releases, executed by petitioners under
oath, was squarely raised and resolved in Labor Arbiter Reyes’ Decision in the
"Unpaid Wages Case," which found categorically that:</p>

<blockquote>"The document relieved absolutely and forever released and
discharged the <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development Enterprises,
Inc., its successors and assigns, of any and all claims and liabilities
whatsoever insofar as their past salaries, <u>termination pay</u>, overtime pay
and other privileges accorded them by law." (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That Decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="5">30 May 1980</st1:date> and was affirmed by the NLRC, First Division,
on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="9">30 September 1982</st1:date>, which
found no justification for disturbing those findings, with this additional
observation:</p>

<blockquote>"More than the above, the record shows that the complainants
received, by virtue of the release documents, amounts which exceeded by leaps
and bounds their original claims for unpaid wages and allowances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid Decisions in the "Unpaid Wages Case" had
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be that private respondents’ appeal was filed on the 12th
day contrary to Article 223 of the Labor Code prescribing ten (10) calendar
days as the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents claim that the tenth day
fell on a Saturday when the offices of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">NLRC </span>were allegedly closed so that their last day to appeal was
Monday, July 14th.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is not
correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Saturday is still considered a
business day and if the last day to appeal falls on a Saturday, the act is still
due on that day (SM <span class="SpellE">Agri</span> and Gen. Machineries vs. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NLRC, </span>et al., G. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">R. No. </span>74806, January 9, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, as the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NLRC </span>had
pointed out in its Comment:</p>

<blockquote>"True, the appeal to it was filed on the 12th day but public
respondent wanted to avoid ruling on the same issue of separation pay for that matter
had been judicially settled in the other case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It merely exercised its prerogative in relaxing its rule regarding the
ten (10) calendar day period for filing appeals (Sec. 1, Rule VIII of the
Revised Rules of the NLRC) from decisions of its Labor Arbiters, as it had done
so in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">similar cases x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> " (p. 6, Comment, p.
333, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Indeed, the perfection of
an appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period is
considered jurisdictional.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
there was legal justification for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NLRC
</span>to have given due <span class="GramE">course</span> to the appeal, namely,
to obviate a miscarriage of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this proceeding, the issue of separation pay had been judicially settled, with
finality, in another case, also by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">NLRC, </span>therefore, had no alternative except <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>forestall the grant of separation
pay twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The principle against unjust
enrichment must be held applicable to labor cases as well.</p>
