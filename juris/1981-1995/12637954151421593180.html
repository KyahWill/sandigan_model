				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Petition for review on <em>certiorari</em> of the decision of 
the Court of Tax Appeals absolving the private respondents from liability for 
capital gains tax on the stocks received by them from the Eastern Theatrical, 
Inc.&nbsp; These were originally four cases involving appeals from the decision of 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue dated July 11, 1966, holding the said 
respondents, Vicente A. Rufino and Remedios S. Rufino, Ernesto D. Rufino and 
Elvira B. Rufino, Rafael R. Rufino and Julieta A. Rufino, and Manuel S. Galvez 
and Ester R. Galvez, liable for deficiency income tax, surcharge and interest in 
the sums of P44,294.88, P27,229.44, P58,082.60 and P58,074.24, respectively, for 
the year 1959.<br><br>The facts, as narrated by the Court of Tax Appeals, are as 
follows:<br><br>The private respondents were the majority stockholders of the 
defunct Eastern Theatrical Co., Inc., a corporation organized in 1934, for a 
period of twenty-five years terminating on January 25, 1959.&nbsp; It had an original 
capital stock of P500,000.00, which was increased in 1949 to P2,000,000.00, 
divided into 200,000 shares at P10.00 per share, and was organized to engage in 
the business of operating theaters, opera houses, places of amusement and other 
related business enterprises, more particularly the Lyric and Capitol Theaters 
in Manila.&nbsp; The President of this corporation (hereinafter referred to as the 
Old Corporation) during the year in question was Ernesto D. Rufino.<br><br>The 
private respondents are also the majority and controlling stockholders of 
another corporation, the Eastern Theatrical, Inc., which was organized on 
December 8, 1958, for a term of 50 years, with an authorized capital stock of 
P200,000.00, each share having a par value of P10.00.&nbsp; This corporation is 
engaged in the same kind of business as the Old Corporation.&nbsp; The 
General-Manager of this corporation (hereinafter referred to as the New 
Corporation) at the time was Vicente A. Rufino.<br><br>In a special meeting of 
stockholders of the Old Corporation on December 17, 1958, to provide for the 
continuation of its business after the end of its corporate life, and upon the 
recommendation of its board of directors, a resolution was passed authorizing 
the Old Corporation to merge with the New Corporation by transferring all its 
business, assets, goodwill, and liabilities to the latter, which in exchange 
would issue and distribute to the shareholders of the Old Corporation one share 
for each share held by them in the said Corporation.<br><br>It was expressly 
declared that the merger of the Old Corporation with the New Corporation was 
necessary to continue the exhibition of moving pictures at the Lyric and Capitol 
Theaters even after the expiration of the corporate existence of the former, in 
view of its pending booking contracts, not to mention its collective bargaining 
agreements with its employees.<br><br>Pursuant to the said resolution, the Old 
Corporation, represented by Ernesto D. Rufino as President, and the New 
Corporation, represented by Vicente A. Rufino as General Manager, signed on 
January 9, 1959, a Deed of Assignment providing for the conveyance and transfer 
of all the business, property, assets and goodwill of the Old Corporation to the 
New Corporation in exchange for the latter's shares of stock to be distributed 
among the shareholders on the basis of one stock for each stock held in the Old 
Corporation except that no new and unissued shares would be issued to the 
shareholders of the Old Corporation; the delivery by the New Corporation to the 
Old Corporation of 125,005-3/4 shares to be distributed to the shareholders of 
the Old Corporation as their corresponding shares of stock in the New 
Corporation; the assumption by the New Corporation of all obligations and 
liabilities of the Old Corporation under its bargaining agreement with the 
Cinema Stage &amp; Radio Entertainment Free Workers (FFW) which included the 
retention of all personnel in the latter's employ; and the increase of the 
capitalization of the New Corporation in compliance with their agreement.&nbsp; This 
agreement was made retroactive to January 1, 1959.<br><br>The aforesaid transfer 
was eventually made by the Old Corporation to the New Corporation, which 
continued the operation of the Lyric and Capitol Theaters and assumed all the 
obligations and liabilities of the Old Corporation beginning January 1, 
1959.<br><br>The resolution of the Old Corporation of December 17, 1958, and the 
Deed of Assignment of January 9, 1959, were approved in a resolution by the 
stockholders of the New Corporation in their special meeting on January 12, 
1959.&nbsp; In the same meeting, the increased capitalization of the New Corporation 
to P2,000,000.00 was also divided into 200,000 shares at P10.00 par value each 
share, and the said increase was registered on March 5, 1959, with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, which approved the same on August 20, 
1959.<br><br>As agreed, and in exchange for the properties, and other assets of 
the Old Corporation, the New Corporation issued to the stockholders of the 
former stocks in the New Corporation equal to the stocks each one held in the 
Old Corporation, as follows:</p>

<p align="justify">It was this above-narrated series of transactions that the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue examined later, resulting in the petitioner declaring 
that the merger of the aforesaid corporations was not undertaken for a <em>bona 
fide</em> business purpose but merely to avoid liability for the capital gains 
tax on the exchange of the old for the new shares of stock.&nbsp; Accordingly, he 
imposed the deficiency assessments against the private respondents for the 
amounts already mentioned.&nbsp; The private respondents' request for reconsideration 
having been denied, they elevated the matter to the Court of Tax Appeals, which 
reversed the petitioner.<br><br>We have given due course to the instant petition 
questioning the decision of the said court in holding that there was a valid 
merger between the Old Corporation and the New Corporation and declaring 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is well established that where stocks for stocks were 
exchanged, and distributed to the stockholders of the corporations, parties to 
the merger or consolidation, pursuant to a plan of reorganization, such exchange 
is exempt from capital gains tax.....<br><br>"In view of the foregoing, we are 
of the opinion and so hold that no taxable gain was derived by petitioners from 
the exchange of their old stocks solely for stocks of the New Corporation 
pursuant to Section 35(c)(2), in relation to (c)(5), of the National Internal 
Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act 1921."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The above-cited Section 35 of the

of this case depends, provides in material part as follows:<br><br>"Sec. 35.&nbsp;

<p align="justify">In support of its position that the Deed of Assignment was 
concluded by the private respondents merely to evade the burden of taxation, the 
petitioner points to the fact that the New Corporation did not actually issue 
stocks in exchange for the properties of the Old Corporation at the time of the 
supposed merger on January 9, 1959.&nbsp; The exchange, he says, was only on paper.&nbsp; 
The increase in capitalization of the New Corporation was registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission only on March 5, 1959, or 37 days after the 
Old Corporation expired on January 25, 1959.&nbsp; Prior to such registration it was 
not possible for the New Corporation to effect the exchange provided for in the 
said agreement because it was capitalized only at P200,000.00 as against the 
capitalization of the Old Corporation at P2,000,000.00.&nbsp; Consequently, as there 
was no merger, the automatic dissolution of the Old Corporation on its expiry 
date resulted in its liquidation, for which the respondents are now liable in 
taxes on their capital gains.<br><br>For their part, the private respondents 
insist that there was a genuine merger between the Old Corporation and the New 
Corporation pursuant to a plan aimed at enabling the latter to continue the 
business of the former in the operation of places of amusement, specifically the 
Capitol and Lyric Theaters.&nbsp; The plan was evolved through the series of 
transactions above narrated, all of which could be treated as a single unit in 
accordance with the requirements of Section 35.&nbsp; Obviously, all these steps did 
not have to be completed at the time of the merger, as there were some of them, 
such as the increase and distribution of the stock of the New Corporation, which 
necessarily had to come afterwards.&nbsp; Moreover, the Old Corporation was dissolved 
on January 1, 1959, pursuant to the Deed of Assignment, and not on January 25, 
1959, its original expiry date.&nbsp; As the properties of the Old Corporation were 
transferred to the New Corporation before that expiry date, there could not have 
been any distribution of liquidating dividends by the Old Corporation for which 
the private respondents should be held liable in taxes.<br><br>We sustain the 
Court of Tax Appeals.&nbsp; We hold that it did not err in finding that no taxable 
gain was derived by the private respondents from the questioned 
transaction.<br><br>Contrary to the claim of the petitioner, there was a valid 
merger although the actual transfer of the properties subject of the Deed of 
Assignment was not made on the date of the merger.&nbsp; In the nature of things, 
this was not possible.&nbsp; Obviously, it was necessary for the Old Corporation to 
surrender its net assets first to the New Corporation before the latter could 
issue its own stock to the shareholders of the Old Corporation because the New 
Corporation had to increase its capitalization for this purpose.&nbsp; This required 
the adoption of the resolution to this effect at the special stockholders 
meeting of the New Corporation on January 12, 1959, the registration of such 
issuance with the SEC on March 5, 1959, and its approval by that body on August 
20, 1959.&nbsp; All these took place after the date of the merger but they were 
deemed part and parcel of, and indispensable to the validity and enforceability 
of, the Deed of Assignment.<br><br>The Court finds no impediment to the exchange 
of property for stock between the two corporations being considered to have been 
effected on the date of the merger.&nbsp; That, in fact, was the intention, and the 
reason why the Deed of Assignment was made retroactive to January 1, 1959.&nbsp; Such 
retroaction provided in effect that all transactions set forth in the merger 
agreement shall be deemed to be taking place simultaneously on January 1, 1959, 
when the Deed of Assignment became operative.<br><br>The certificates of stock 
subsequently delivered by the New Corporation to the private respondents were 
only evidence of the ownership of such stocks.&nbsp; Although these certificates 
could be issued to them only after the approval by the SEC of the increase in 
capitalization of the New Corporation, the title thereto, legally speaking, was 
transferred to them on the date the merger took effect, in accordance with the 
Deed of Assignment.<br><br>The basic consideration, of course, is the purpose of 
the merger, as this would determine whether the exchange of properties involved 
therein shall be subject or not to the capital gains tax.&nbsp; The criterion laid 
down by the law is that the merger "must be undertaken for a <em>bona fide</em> 
business purpose and not solely for the purpose of escaping the burden of 
taxation." We must therefore seek and ascertain the intention of the parties in 
the light of their conduct contemporaneously with, and especially after, the 
questioned merger pursuant to the Deed of Assignment of January 9, 
1959.<br><br>It has been suggested that one certain indication of a scheme to 
evade the capital gains tax is the subsequent dissolution of the new corporation 
after the transfer to it of the properties of the old corporation and the 
liquidation of the former soon thereafter.&nbsp; This highly suspect development is 
likely to be a mere subterfuge aimed at circumventing the requirements of 
Section 35 of the Tax Code while seeming to be a valid corporate combination.&nbsp; 
Speaking of such a device, Justice Sutherland declared for the <em>United States 
Supreme Court in Helvering v. Gregory</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"When subdivision (b) speaks of a transfer of assets by one 
corporation to another, it means a transfer made 'in pursuance of a plan of 
reorganization' (Section 112[g]) of corporate business; and not a transfer of 
assets by one corporation to another in pursuance of a plan having no relation 
to the business of either, as plainly is the case here.&nbsp; Putting aside, then, 
the question of motive in respect of taxation altogether, and fixing the 
character of proceeding by what actually occurred, what do we find?&nbsp; Simply an 
operation having no business or corporate purpose — a mere devise which put on 
the form of a corporate reorganization as a disguise for concealing its real 
character, and the sole object and accomplishment of which was the consummation 
of a preconceived plan, not to reorganize a business or any part of a business, 
but to transfer a parcel of corporate shares to the petitioner.&nbsp; No doubt, a new 
and valid corporation was created.&nbsp; But that corporation was nothing more than a 
contrivance to the end last described.&nbsp; It was brought into existence for no 
other purpose; it performed, as it was intended from the beginning it should 
perform no other function.&nbsp; When that limited function had been exercised, it 
immediately was put to death.<br><br>"In these circumstances, the facts speak 
for themselves and are susceptible of but one interpretation.&nbsp; The whole 
undertaking, though conducted according to the terms of subdivision (b), was in 
fact an elaborate and devious form of conveyance masquerading as a corporate 
reorganization and nothing else.&nbsp; The rule which excludes from consideration the 
motive of tax avoidance is not pertinent to the situation, because the 
transaction upon its face lies outside the plain intent of the statute.&nbsp; To hold 
otherwise would be to exalt artifice above reality and to deprive the statutory 
provision in question of all serious purpose."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We see no such furtive intention in the instant case.&nbsp; It is 
clear, in fact, that the purpose of the merger was to continue the business of 
the Old Corporation, whose corporate life was about to expire, through the New 
Corporation to which all the assets and obligations of the former had been 
transferred.&nbsp; What argues strongly, indeed, for the New Corporation is that it 
was not dissolved after the merger agreement in 1959.&nbsp; On the contrary, it 
continued to operate the places of amusement originally owned by the Old 
Corporation and transferred to the New Corporation, particularly the Capitol and 
Lyric Theaters, in accordance with the Deed of Assignment.&nbsp; The New Corporation, 
in fact, continues to do so today after taking over the business of the Old 
Corporation twenty-seven years ago.<br><br>It may be recalled at this point that 
under the original provisions of the old Corporation Law, which was in effect 
when the merger agreement was concluded in 1959, it was not possible for a 
corporation, by mere amendment of its charter, to extend its life beyond the 
time fixed in the original articles; in fact, this was specifically prohibited 
by Section 18, which provided that "any corporation may amend its articles of 
incorporation by a majority vote of its board of directors or trustees and the 
vote or written assent of two-thirds of its members, if it be a non-stock 
corporation, or if it be a stock corporation, by the vote or written assent of 
the stockholders representing at least two-thirds of the subscribed capital 
stock of the corporation x x x:&nbsp; <em>Provided, however</em>, That the life of 
said corporation shall not be extended by said amendment beyond the time fixed 
in the original articles x x x."<br><br>This prohibition, which incidentally has 
since been deleted, made it necessary for the Old and New Corporations to enter 
into the questioned merger, to enable the former to continue its unfinished 
business through the latter.<br><br>The procedure for such merger was prescribed 
in Section 28-1/2 of the old Corporation Law which, although not expressly 
authorizing a merger by name (as the new Corporation Code now does in its 
Section 77), provided that "a corporation may, by action taken at any meeting of 
its board of directors, sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all or 
substantially all of its property and assets, including its goodwill, upon such 
terms and conditions and for such considerations, which may be money, stocks, 
bonds, or other instruments for the payment of money or other property or other 
considerations, as its board of directors deem expedient." The transaction 
contemplated in the old law covered the second type of merger defined by Section 
35 of the Tax Code as "the acquisition by one corporation of all or 
substantially all of the properties of another corporation solely for stock," 
which is precisely what happened in the present case.<br><br>What is also worth 
noting is that, as in the case of the Old Corporation when it was dissolved on 
December 31, 1958, there has been no distribution of the assets of the New 
Corporation since then and up to now, as far as the record discloses.&nbsp; To date, 
the private respondents have not derived any benefit from the merger of the Old 
Corporation and the New Corporation almost three decades earlier that will make 
them subject to the capital gains tax under Section 35.&nbsp; They are no more liable 
now than they were when the merger took effect in 1959, as the merger, being 
genuine, exempted them under the law from such tax.<br><br>By this decision, the 
government is, of course, not left entirely without recourse, at least in the 
future.&nbsp; The fact is that the merger had merely deferred the claim for taxes, 
which may be asserted by the government later, when gains are realized and 
benefits are distributed among the stockholders as a result of the merger.&nbsp; In 
other words, the corresponding taxes are not forever foreclosed or forfeited but 
may at the proper time and without prejudice to the government still be imposed 
upon the private respondents, in accordance with Section 35(c)(4) of the Tax 
Code.&nbsp; Then, in assessing the tax, "the basis of the property transferred in the 
hands of the transferee shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the 
transferor, increased by the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the 
transfer." The only inhibition now is that that time has not yet 
come.<br><br>The reason for this conclusion is traceable to the purpose of the 
legislature in adopting the provision of law in question.&nbsp; The basic idea was to 
correct the Tax Code which, by imposing taxes on corporate combinations and 
expansions, discouraged the same to the detriment of economic progress, 
particularly the promotion of local industry.&nbsp; Speaking of this problem, H.B. 
No. 7233, which was subsequently enacted into R.A. No. 1921 embodying Section 35 
as now worded, declared in the Explanatory Note: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The exemption from the tax of the gain derived from exchanges 
of stock solely for stock of another corporation resulting from corporate 
mergers or consolidations under the above provisions, as amended, was intended 
to encourage corporations in pooling, combining or expanding their resources 
conducive to the economic development of the country."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Our ruling then is that the merger in question involved a 
pooling of resources aimed at the continuation and expansion of business and so 
came under the letter and intendment of the National Internal Revenue Code, as 
amended by the above-cited law, exempting from the capital gains tax exchanges 
of property effected under lawful corporate 
combinations.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Court of 
Tax Appeals is affirmed in full, without any pronouncement as to 
costs.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p>
