dated July 27, 1988 in Civil Case No. 84-24032 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> M. Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> M.
Ruiz vs. <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
and Adolfo Cruz" amending the May 15, 1986 decision of Judge Antonio M.
Martinez (now Justice of the Court of Appeals).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> and Adolfo Cruz are common-law spouses and owners
in common of a 2-storey house and lots described in Transfer Certificate of
Title (TCT) No. 56053 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City but registered only in the name of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> M.
Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> M. Ruiz are the lessees of Door
No. 1 of the aforesaid two storey house divided into 2 doors, for a monthly
rental of P650.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime on <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="11">November
 19, 1982</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> executed an
agreement where it was provided that Ruiz will buy the house and lot for the
sum of P175,000.00 under the following terms and conditions:</p>

<blockquote>"That I, EULALIO M. RUIZ, of legal age, Filipino, married to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> M. Ruiz, with residence and postal address at 399
Gen. Luna, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Metro Manila, Philippines, am
a tenant of MISS ZENAIDA S. SANGALANG and I agree to purchase the above
mentioned parcel of land from MISS ZENAIDA <span style="">S. </span>SANGALANG for the total amount of ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
THOUSAND PESOS (175,000.00), Philippine Currency, to be paid as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P65,000.00) down
payment and will assume the amount of balance of THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE
HUNDRED PESOS (P31,500.00) with the BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLAND, <span class="SpellE">Marulas</span> Branch, Metro Manila; that after payment of said
balance mortgage a balance of seventy eight thousand five hundred pesos
(P78,500.00) will be payable on or before December 31, 1983; my failure to
comply with the above conditions of payment, the said property above described
will be open for sale and all partial payments will be refunded by Miss <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>". (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 45)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was also stipulated that the Ruiz spouses will continue paying
the monthly rental of P650.00 until the amount of P175,000.00 shall have been
fully satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the following payments were made by
Ruiz:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P65,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
as down payment and P21,119.62 to the Bank on the assumed mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is disagreement however as to the
amount paid to <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> on the balance of
P78,500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
maintains that she received only P33,793.00 while Ruiz insists that they paid
P53,073.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Ruiz spouses filed a complaint on April 24, 1984 for
specific performance with damages against <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> and Adolfo Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Ibid, p. 14).</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the trial court found that the Ruiz spouses failed
pay in full the balance of P78,500.00 on or before December 31, <span style="">1983 as </span>stipulated and even on the
extended period of March 22, 1984.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the Ruiz spouses are not entitled to their prayer for specific
performance with damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>the same breath, the trial court
decided that it is only fair that <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> return/refund to the Ruiz spouses the payment
made by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, it ruled
that the Ruiz spouses shall continue to pay the agreed amount of rental in the
amount of P650.00 until the property is surrendered to <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
(RTC decision, May 15, 1986, p. 7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 48).</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, in view of all the foregoing, we hereby rule as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. <span style=""> </span>Ordering the plaintiffs to pay defendant <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> the amount of
P20,000.00 moral damages:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. <span style=""> </span>Ordering plaintiffs to pay defendant <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>, attorney's fees in the amount of P15,000.00; and
to pay the costs of suit; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. <span style=""> </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> is hereby ordered to return the payments made by
the plaintiffs pursuant to the Agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED". (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 48)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Ruiz spouses appealed the decision to the Court of <span class="SpellE">Apeals</span> but the same <span style="">was
</span>dismissed for failure to pay the docket fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="">p. </span>162) On May 29, 1987, an entry of
judgment was made by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of the private respondents, respondent Judge issued an
order for the issuance of a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Ibid., p. 59).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Clerk of Court, in his capacity as <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>
<span style="">city sheriff, caused </span>the
execution of the 1st and 2nd paragraphs of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the May 15, 1986 decision without including in the writ, the
execution of the 3rd par. thereof in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A notice of levy as well as a notice of <span style="">garnishment were </span>both issued to the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 51)</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 2, 1987, the Ruiz spouses filed an "<u>Ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> Motion for Execution of Decision Now Partly
Executed," praying that a writ of execution be issued for par. 3 of the
said <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion and that the sheriff be
ordered to make full execution of the decision by "off-setting"
and/or setting-off par. 3 as against pars. 1 and 2 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid, p. 92)</p>

<p class="BODY">An order was issued by the respondent judge on September 8, 1987
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the fact that a writ of execution has
already been issued and the same was enforced only with respect to paragraphs 1
and 2 of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision
dated May 15, 1986, let a writ of execution be issued with respect to paragraph
3 of the said <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 59)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> order was reiterated by
the respondent judge in his order dated December 11, 1987 (Ibid., p. 60) after
an omnibus motion was filed by the petitioners on September 8, 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid., p. 53)</p>

<p class="BODY">As expected, the parties could not agree on the execution of the
decision, as regards par. 3 thereof; that is the amount to be returned by <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> to the Ruiz spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> and
Adolfo Cruz on May 7, 1988 moved to amend said decision of May 15, 1986 which
they alleged to have clear disparities and evident ambiguities between the body
of said decision and the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while the trial court is fully aware that a decision once
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> can no longer be amended or
corrected, it opted for the purpose of finally settling the claims of the
parties and thereby avoid multiplicity of suits, to amend the decision in
question, on July 27, 1988, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> <span style="">portion </span>of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, Order is hereby issued directing:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the cancellation of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lis</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> </span>annotated at the back
of the title of the subject property by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the plaintiffs to pay the defendant the sum
of P1,500.00 monthly from May 15, 1986, the effective date of the decision up
to the date they vacate door no. 2;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the return of payments made by the plaintiffs
to defendant <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
which shall be without prejudice to off-setting of rental payments from
November 1982; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the writ of possession be issued on the
property, subject matter of the rescission of the contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 64)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> and Cruz filed a Motion for
Execution on the above-quoted order <span style="">on </span>September
1, 1988 (Ibid., p. 65) but before the day of the hearing of said motion, the
Ruiz spouses filed an "Urgent Motion to Cancel Hearing of Motion,"
(Ibid., p. 127).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 15, 1988, the<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span> filed the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of the 2nd division of this Court dated January
10, 1990, the petition was given due course (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 152-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners’ memorandum was
filed on April 11, 1990 (Ibid., p. 192) while respondents’ memorandum was filed
on March 30, 1990 (Ibid., p. 171).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue to be resolved in the instant petition
is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not there is an ambiguity
in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the May 15, 1986
decision sufficient to warrant the questioned order of the respondent court
amending subject final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span>
failed to comply with the agreement and <span class="SpellE">recission</span> of
the contract is in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties
are also agreed that the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span> must return the
physical possession of the property to <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
while the latter is obliged to return all partial payments made on the property
to the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span> in accordance with the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the bone of contention in this case is
the exact amount to be returned by <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> to the
Ruiz spouses which was not spelled out by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span> claim
that they are entitled to a refund of P124,192.62 plus 24% interest compounded
annually, the alleged legal rate under Central Bank Circular, or a total amount
of P169,414.95.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>, on the other hand, countered
that she received only the amount of P120,092.62 or a difference of P4,100.00
from that claimed by the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span>, let alone the
computation of interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> insists that she is entitled to a P1,500.00 a
month rental for Door No. 2 of said house which the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span>
occupied after the execution of the agreement (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 166) instead of confining themselves to Door No. 1 which they used to occupy
and for which they have originally been paying rentals.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful study of the decision of the trial court of May 15,
1986 shows that aside from the fact that the refund ordered to be made by <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> was not specified in exact numbers, there appears
to be no ambiguity in the decision to such an extent as to warrant an amendment
of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the total amount of P139,192.62 claimed by the Ruiz spouses
to have been actually paid to <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>, only the
amount of P15,000.00 in the form of dishonored checks have been discounted by
the trial court leaving a balance of P124,192.62; more specifically shown as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Downpayment</span>
on Nov. 19, 1982 – – – –<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P65,000.00<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Payment to the Bank of P.I. – – – – – –
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P21,119.62<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Payment made to <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
P53,073.00 less<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>P15,000.00 total sum of two<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) dishonored checks – – – – – – – – –<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P38,073.00<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>– – – – – – – – – –
– – – – – – –<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Total Payments Made <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>P124,192.62</blockquote>

<blockquote>(decision, p. 2 &amp; 3<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, it <span style="">is </span>evident
that this is the amount that <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> was ordered to
return to the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span> pursuant to par. 3 of the said <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only set-off specified by the trial court in the assailed May
15, 1986 decision were the lost profits suffered by <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
because of the annotation of the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lis</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> on her title by the Ruiz
spouses which were considered compensated by the increase in value of the
property due to the repair made by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it appearing that there was in fact a part execution of pars.
1 and 2 of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the 1986
decision against the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span>, it is but proper that
the amount to be paid by <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> is the total
payments made by the petitioners in the amount of P124,192.62.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span>’ claim of interest as
aforementioned, it has been held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Fule</span>, 133 SCRA 762 (1984) that where the court
judgment which did not provide for interest is already final, there is no
reason to add interest in the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Interest was not demanded by the <span class="SpellE">Ruizes</span> when
the case was pending before the lower court, hence, there is no reason for this
Court to grant such claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As ruled by
this Court, such claim is groundless since the decision and orders sought to be
enforced do not direct the payment of interest and have long become final (<span class="SpellE">Canonizado</span> v. Ordonez-Benitez, 149 SCRA 555[1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as to <span class="SpellE">Sangalang's</span> claim for
P1,500.00 as monthly rental for Door No. 2, the records show that such claim
was never raised in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
issue of additional rentals was brought up by <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>
only when the motion for execution of par. 3 of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision was filed by the Ruiz spouses (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 189).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a basic rule that an
issue which was not raised in the court below cannot be raised for the first
time on appeal as it would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play,
justice and due process (<span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Servidad</span>, 107 SCRA 276 [1981]; De la Santa v. CA, 140 SCRA
44, [1985]; <span class="SpellE">Dihiansan</span> v. CA, 157 SCRA 434 [1987]; <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> v. CA, 147 SCRA 434 [1987]; <span class="SpellE">Dulos</span>
Realty and <span class="SpellE">Dev't</span>. Corp. v. CA 157 SCRA 425 [1988];
Ramos v. IAC, GR No. 78282, July 5, 1989; Filipino Merchants vs. CA, GR No.
85141, Nov. 28, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Sangalang's</span> claim cannot be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, since the May 15, 1986 decision has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and in fact has been partly executed, the
respondent judge had lost its jurisdiction thereon (<span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span>
Mining Corp. vs. <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, G.R. 77210, Sept. 19, 1988;
<span class="SpellE">Baclayon</span> et al. v. CA, G.R. No. 89132, Feb. 26,
1990).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has exceeded his authority,
considering that the trial court has no authority to modify or vary the terms
and conditions of a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Nabong</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sadang</span>, <span style="">167</span>
SCRA 232 [1988]; Commercial Credit Corporation vs. CA, 169 SCRA 1 [1989];
Christian Literature Crusade v. NLRC, 171 SCRA 712 [1989]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What remains in his authority in relation
thereto is purely the ministerial enforcement or execution of the judgment
(Christian Lit. Crusade, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Baclayan</span> vs.
CA <u>supra</u>.) Therefore, for having substantially affected the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment such Order of the respondent judge dated
July 27, 1988 is null and void for lack of jurisdiction, <span style="">including </span>the entire proceedings held
for the purpose (<span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span> Mining vs. <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, <u>supra</u>).</p>
