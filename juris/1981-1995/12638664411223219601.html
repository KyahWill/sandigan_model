Castillo, 28 SCRA 719 [1969]).</span></blockquote> <blockquote>As the civil status of the child is the source from which the right to support is derived, there must be a declaration to that effect before support can be ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a declaration may be provisional, it being sufficient that affidavits are considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Crisolo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Mangoma</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, 90 Phil. 508 [1951]; Sanchez v. Francisco, 68 Phil. 110 [1939]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the question must nevertheless be squarely resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be that the birth certificate is prima facie evidence of acknowledgment of the child, so that until it is finally shown to be spurious it must be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Civil Code, Art. 410; Act No. 3753, sec. 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it may be that its probative value is impaired by the verified opposition of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are, however questions for the trial court to resolve in passing on the application for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>."</blockquote> <p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>the subsequent resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1985</st1:date>, the appellate court also made the following observations:</p> <blockquote>"The contention has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although Art. 291, in enumerating those entitled to support, refers in paragraph 3 to ‘acknowledged natural children,’ and in paragraph 5 simply to ‘illegitimate children who are not natural,’ nonetheless<span style=""> there is a need for the l</span>atter class of children (spurious) to be recognized either voluntarily or by judicial decree, otherwise they cannot demand support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent contends that the cases cited in the decision (<span class="SpellE">Crisolo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, 94 Phil. 862 [1954] Cruz v. Castillo, 28 SCRA 719 [1969]) refer to the right of natural children to support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle, however, is the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in <span class="SpellE"><u>Paulino</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span></u>, 113 Phil. 697 [1961], which involves a claim to inheritance by a spurious child, it was held:</blockquote> <p class="2Q">‘An illegitimate (spurious) child to be entitled to support and <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights from his putative or presumed parents must prove his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Filiation</span> may be established by the voluntary or compulsory recognition of the illegitimate (spurious) child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recognition is voluntary when ‘made in the record of birth, a will, a statement before a court of record, or in any authentic writing.’ It is compulsory when by court action the child brings about his recognition.’</p> <p class="BODY">Article 291 of the Civil Code provides as follows:</p> <blockquote>"ART. 291.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following are obliged to support each other to the whole extent set forth in the preceding article:</blockquote> <blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The spouses;</blockquote> <blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Legitimate ascendants and descendants;</blockquote> <blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parents and acknowledged natural children and the legitimate descendants of the latter;</blockquote> <blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parents and natural children by legal fiction and the legitimate and <span style="">illegitimate </span>descendants of the latter;</blockquote> <blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parents and illegitimate children who are not natural.</blockquote> <p class="2Q">Brothers and sisters owe their legitimate and natural brothers and sisters, although they are only of the half-blood, the necessaries of life, when by a physical or mental defect, or any other cause not imputable to the recipients, the latter cannot secure their subsistence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assistance <span style="">includes, in a proper case, expenses necessary for elementary education and for professional or vocational training."<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class="BODY">From the foregoing provision it is clear that parents and illegitimate children who are not natural children are also obliged to support each other as specified in paragraph no. 5 above-cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be distinguished from the obligation to support each other as between the parents and acknowledged natural children and the legitimate or illegitimate children of the latter; and that between parents and natural children by legal fiction and the legitimate and illegitimate descendants of the latter under paragraphs (3) and (4) above-cited.</p> <p class="BODY">Under Article 287 of the Civil Code it is provided:</p> <blockquote>"ART. 287<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Illegitimate</span> children other than natural in accordance with Article 269 and other than natural children by legal fiction are entitled to support and such <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights as are granted in this Code."</blockquote> <p class="BODY">In this case petitioner established the paternity of the child <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alfie</span></span><span style=""> </span>not only by her own affidavit but also by the affidavits of two (2) witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition thereto petitioner submitted a birth certificate of the child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent claims that the same is spurious as it was sworn before a notary public in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> when the child was born in <span class="SpellE">Cavinte</span> Maternity Clinic in Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p> <p class="BODY">There must be a declaration of the status of the child from which the right to support is derived and before support can be ordered.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>The requirement for recognition by the father or mother jointly or by only one of them as provided by law refers in particular to a natural child under Article 276 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a child is presumed to be the natural child of the parents recognizing it who had the legal capacity to contract marriage at the <span style="">time of conception.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, an illegitimate child like the minor <span class="SpellE">Alfie</span> in this case whose father, the private respondent herein, is married and had no legal capacity to </span>contract marriage at the time of his conception is not a natural child but an illegitimate child or spurious child in which case recognition is not required before support may be granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p> <p class="BODY">However, under Article 887 of the Civil Code, in all cases of illegitimate children, their <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> must be proved.<span style="">&nbsp;
