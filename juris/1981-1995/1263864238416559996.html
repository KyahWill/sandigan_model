<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On appeal, the appellate
court dismissed the petitioners’ petition on the grounds that the trial court
has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case below considering that
what is being sought therein specifically is not the nullification of the
decision in Civil Case No. 30159, but the nullification of the auction sale of
the property in dispute which the private respondent claims to be conjugal in
nature and, </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">such, could not
be held liable for a corporate obligation without her knowledge and consent;
that therefore, there is also no <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>; that the said private respondent had a valid
cause of action and that the respondent's action has not prescribed since the
latter filed the action only on June 16, 1968 and even if the counting of the
four-year prescriptive period be reckoned from the cancellation of her title,
still said respondent's right to recover possession has not yet prescribed.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this present case, the petitioners principally contend that
the private respondent's action below had already prescribed because the
four-year period should be reckoned from the registration of the petitioner
bank's certificate of sale in 1959.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the same covered the whole property, the respondent,
therefore, had constructive notice of such sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, they argue that the private
respondent was also placed on notice when the levy and attachment was annotated
at the back of the title on May 14, 1957, and, as a matter of fact, the
respondent even signed the agreement to postpone the sale, she, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">being </span>the treasurer of Mindanao Deep
Development Co., but that the respondent failed to assert whatever right she
had on the property and neither did she file any third-party claim or an action
to recover her conjugal share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
addition, the petitioners state that the amended decision of the then Juvenile
and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) awarding the property to the respondent was
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only </span>rendered in 1968, long
after the petitioner bank had registered its interest in 1959 and obtained
title in 1965.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners,
therefore, maintain that their motion to dismiss filed below should have been
granted on the ground that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondent's
action </span>had already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records will bear out the fact that when the property in
dispute was levied upon, the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondent
knew about it because she was the treasurer of the Mindanao Deep Development
Co., and as such, she even signed the agreement to postpone the sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If she had any interest in the property, she
should have asserted the same during that time; and since the petitioner Bank </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">able to obtain a certificate of sale and registered it in 1959, the
private respondent is deemed to have constructive notice of the same as early
as 1959.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Thus, in the case of <u>Heirs</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Maria</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Marasigan</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Intermediate</u>
<u>Appellate</u> <u>Court</u>, (152 SCRA 253, 259-260 [1987]), we ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>clear
showing that although the late Maria <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span>
acquired the property in question from the <span class="SpellE">Bazars</span>
pursuant to a deed of absolute sale on December 18, 1974 or a little <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">over </span>four months before the filing of
Civil Case No. 97479, the transaction became effective as against third persons
only on July 5, 1977 when it was registered with the Registry of Deeds of
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the act of registration
which creates constructive notice to the whole world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 51 of Act 496, as amended by Section
52 of the Property Registration Decree (P.D. 1529) provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Sec. 52.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Constructive notice upon
registration.</span> - Every conveyance <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>affecting
registered land shall, if registered, filed or entered in the office of the
Register of Deeds for the province or city where the land to which it relates
lies, be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">constructive notice to all
persons from the time of such registering, filing or entering."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The private respondent,
therefore, should have opposed the petitioner Bank's registration of
certificate of sale of the whole property if indeed she </span>claims that
one-half of the said property belongs to her.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Furthermore, the <span class="GramE">respondent,</span> was unable to prove </span>fraud or any
irregularity in the issuance of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, she did not make any move at that
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It, thus, follows that she cannot
also avail of the action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> which must
be filed within four </span>(4) years from the discovery of fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only fact <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that respondent asserts is that the property is conjugal and what was
levied upon was only her husband's share and not hers, and, therefore, the sale
was void in so far as her share was concerned which is, one half of the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But aside from doing nothing
within the prescriptive period stated above, the private </span>respondent did
not present any evidence that the property was <span class="GramE">conjugal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>able to present only the decision of the
JDRC in 1968, three years after the Bank had obtained title to the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, since the respondent
failed to present any evidence during the levy and sale of the property that
the same was acquired during her marriage with her husband, the
judgment-debtor, the presumption that the levied property was conjugal cannot
apply since the title of the property was in the name of her husband and only
described him as "married to" the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Moises</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Jocson</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Hon.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals,</u>
<u>et</u> <u>al.</u>, (G.R. No. 55322, February 16, 1989), we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"It is thus clear that before <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> may validly invoke the presumption under
Article 160 he must first present proof that the disputed properties were
acquired during the marriage of Emilio <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The certificate of title,
however, upon which petitioner rests <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his
claim is insufficient.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the properties were registered
in the name of ‘Emilio <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Jocson</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> married to <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span>’ is no proof that the properties were acquired
during the spouses' <span class="SpellE">coverture</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acquisition of title and registration thereof
are two different acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well
settled that registration does not confer title but merely confirms one already
existing (See <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>,
<u>supra</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be that the
properties under dispute were acquired by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
when he was still a bachelor but were registered only after his marriage to <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span>, which explains
why he was described in the certificates of title </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">married to the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to petitioner's position, the certificates of title
show, on their face, that the properties were exclusively Emilio <span class="SpellE">Jocson's</span>, the registered owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so because the words ‘married to’ <span class="GramE">preceding</span> ‘<span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span>' are merely descriptive of the civil status of
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> (<span class="SpellE">Litam</span> v.
Rivera, 100 Phil. 354; Stuart v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, No. <span class="GramE">L-16467, April 27, 1962, 4 SCRA 1143; <span class="SpellE">Magallon</span>

other words, the import from the certificates of title is that Emilio <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> is the owner of the properties, the same having been
registered in his name alone, and that he is married to <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span>
<span class="SpellE">Poblete</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are not unmindful that in numerous cases <span class="GramE">We</span> consistently held that registration of the property in
the name of only one spouse does not negate the possibility of it being
conjugal (See <span class="SpellE">Bucoy</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>,
No. <span class="GramE">L-25775, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 26, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 23 SCRA 248).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this ruling is not inconsistent with the
above pronouncement for in those cases there was proof that the properties,
though registered in the name of only one spouse, were indeed conjugal
properties, or that they have been acquired during the marriage of the spouses,
and therefore, presumed conjugal, without the adverse party having presented
