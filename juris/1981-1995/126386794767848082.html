				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These disbarment proceedings against Attorney <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> were filed by Maria <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span>,
docketed as Administrative Case No. 2285, and by Spouses <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
Angel and Alfonso Angel (hereinafter referred to as the Angel Spouses),
docketed as Administrative Case No. 2302.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both cases were consolidated upon the instance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> who, in his answer,
denied the imputations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaints in Adm. Case No. 2285 and Adm. Case No. 2302 were
filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1981</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1981</st1:date>, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1982</st1:date>,
after Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> filed his comment, the Court
referred the case to the Solicitor General for investigation, report, and
recommendation as provided, then, by Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of
Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1990" day="25" month="4">April 25,
 1990</st1:date>, more than eight years later, that the Office of the Solicitor
General returned the entire records of Adm. Cases Nos. 2285 and 2302 with the
accompanying complaint for disbarment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the administrative complaint for disbarment in both cases
was filed.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;">ADMINISTRATIVE CASE NO. 2285</p>

<p class="BODY">Maria <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> claims in her verified
complaint that respondent <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
who has been her "retaining (sic) counsel" in all her legal problems
and court cases as early as 1966, has always had her unqualified faith and
confidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1972, one Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Blaylock
sued <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
from a parcel of land described as "<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 4131,
TS-308." <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> appeared for <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span>
and also for Blaylock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> confronted <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> about
this but the latter reassured <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> that he will
take care of everything and that there was no need for <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span>
to hire a new lawyer since he is still <span class="SpellE">Tiania's</span>
lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
prepared the answer in the said <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, which
<span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> signed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> made <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span>
sign a Compromise Agreement<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which the latter signed without reading.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two years from the submission of the Compromise Agreement, <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> was shocked when she received an order to vacate<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold off
her <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> for another two years, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> advised <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> to pay him
a certain amount for the sheriff.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> denied the charges in
detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he handled some legal
problems and executed some <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> deeds for <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> from 1966-1971, <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> had
also engaged the services of various counsel to represent her in several
criminal and civil cases, involving violations of municipal ordinances and <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he
could not be the complainant's "retaining counsel" in all her legal
problems and court cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> then insisted that he appeared
on behalf of Mrs. Blaylock, and not as counsel of <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span>,
in Civil Case No. 1104-0.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never saw
or talked to <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> from the time the said civil case
was filed up to the pre-trial and as such could not have discussed with her the
complaint, the hiring of another lawyer, and more so the preparation of the
answer in the said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted
that during the pre-trial of the said case, <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span>
showed to him a document which supported her claim, over the property in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
after going over the document, expressed his doubts about its
authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This convinced <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> to sign a Compromise Agreement and to pay the
acquisition cost to Blaylock over a period of six (6) months.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> never fulfilled any of her
obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She moreover made the
situation worse by selling the contested property to a third party even after
an alias writ of execution had ordered the transfer of the possession of the
disputed property to Blaylock.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the petition was filed five years after <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span> allegedly suffered "terrible shock" upon
receiving the Notice to Vacate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Citing <span class="SpellE"><b>Arboleda</b></span><b> v. <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,</b><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> said that the overdue filing of a complaint against
a lawyer should already create a suspicion about the motives of the complainant
or the merit of the complaint.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;">ADMINISTRATIVE CASE NO. 2302</p>

<p class="BODY">The Angel spouses, complainants in A.C. No. 2302, allege that
sometime in 1972, they sold their house in favor of Blaylock (the same Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Blaylock in A.C. No. 2285) for the amount of
seventy thousand pesos (P70,000.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> (the same respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>), acted as their counsel and prepared the Deed
of Sale of a Residential House and Waiver of Rights Over a <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the money paid by Blaylock, the Angel spouses bought another
parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> prepared the Deed of Sale which was signed by the
vendor, a certain Laura <span class="SpellE">Dalanan</span>, and the Angel
spouses, as the vendees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> allegedly made the Angel spouses sign two (2) more
documents which, accordingly, were made parts of the sale transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Those two (2) documents later turned out to be a Real Estate
Mortgage of the same property purchased from Laura <span class="SpellE">Dalanan</span>
and a Promissory Note,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
both in favor of Blaylock.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Angel spouses never realized the nature of the said documents
until they received a complaint naming them as defendants in a collection suit<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
filed by <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> on behalf of the plaintiff,
Commercial Corporation of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, a firm headed by
Blaylock.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Angel spouses added that <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
reassured them that there was no need for them to engage the services of a new
lawyer since he will take care of everything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> even appeared as counsel for the Angel
spouses in a civil case<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
they filed sometime in 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in
1978, a Notice to Vacate,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
on the basis of the two (2) documents they signed in 1972, was served on them.</p>

<p class="BODY">These acts, the complainants charge, violate the ethics of the
legal profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They lost their
property as a result of the respondent's fraudulent manipulation, taking
advantage of his expertise in law against his own unsuspecting and trusting
clients.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in the first case, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> presented
an elaborate explanation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> alleged that it was his client,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Blaylock, who introduced to him the
Angel spouses in 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Blaylock wanted <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> to check the background of the Angel spouses in
connection with the loan they were seeking from Blaylock.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his interview with Mrs. Angel, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
learned that the amount of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) to be loaned to
the Angel spouses from Blaylock would be used to repurchase the property at <st1:street><st1:address>39
  <span class="SpellE">Fendler</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
which the Angel spouses had originally owned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In turn, the Angel spouses should sell the same to Blaylock.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> himself facilitated the transfer
by delivering to the complainants the P20.000 for the repurchase of the <span class="SpellE">Fendler</span> property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This in turn was sold to Blaylock.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the sale of the <span class="SpellE">Fendler</span> property
would render the Angel spouses homeless, they suggested to Blaylock that they
would need an additional loan of forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00) to purchase
from Laura <span class="SpellE">Dalanan</span> another property located at <st1:street><st1:address>#66
  <span class="SpellE">Kessing</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
which was mortgaged in favor of a certain <span class="SpellE">Salud</span>
Jimenez.</p>

<p class="BODY">To expedite the transfer of the <span class="SpellE">Kessing</span>
property from <span class="SpellE">Dalanan</span> to the Angel spouses, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> himself delivered to <span class="SpellE">Salud</span>
Jimenez twenty-two thousand (P22,000.00) pesos from Blaylock in payment of the
mortgage debt of <span class="SpellE">Dalanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The balance of eighteen thousand (P18,000.00)
pesos was then delivered to Mrs. Angel upon the execution of the final
documents between the Angel spouses and <span class="SpellE">Dalanan</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> explained that simultaneously he
executed a Real Estate Mortgage over the <span class="SpellE">Kessing</span>
property and a Promissory Note for the Angel spouses in favor of Blaylock for
the amount of seventy-four thousand seventy five (P74,075.00) pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although only forty thousand (P40,000.00) was
received by Mrs. Angel and <span class="SpellE">Dalanan</span>, the difference
between seventy-four thousand seventy five pesos and forty thousand pesos
represented the interests in advance over a period of five years in which the
loan would be paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the monthly amortizations became due, the Angel spouses
never paid any of it despite repeated demands from Blaylock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Blaylock assigned the promissory note to the
Commercial Credit Corporation which later on filed a civil case against the
Angel spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Angel spouses never filed an answer and were declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon execution, the <span class="SpellE">Kessing</span> property was levied on and sold at public auction
followed by a Notice to Vacate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> admits appearing for the Angel
spouses in Civil Case No. 1458, filed July 26, 1976, but only because he had
his client Blaylock's interest foremost in his mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Blaylock, through <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, had sued one <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermogeno</span>, a lessee of
Blaylock's property, in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before the institution of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, <span class="SpellE">Hermogeno</span>, leased
out the same premises to Mrs. Angel on <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four days later, <span class="SpellE">Hermogeno</span>, without the knowledge and consent of Mrs. Angel,
regained possession of the leased premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, in filing a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Hermogeno</span>, on behalf of Blaylock, was also doing so for
Mrs. Angel.</p>

<p class="BODY">These explanations notwithstanding, the Solicitor General charged
the respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
with malpractice and gross misconduct punishable under Section 27 of Rule 138
of the Rules of Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and violation of his oath of office as an attorney for the following acts:</p>

<blockquote>a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Administrative Case No.
2285</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">At the pre-trial of Civil Case No. 1104-0, the respondent appeared
as counsel for the plaintiff and while appearing for the same, gave advice and
warnings to the defendant which paved the way for an amicable settlement and
which may have prejudiced the defendant's rights.</p>

<p class="2Q">b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Administrative Case No.
2302</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(1) Respondent,
while acting as counsel for Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Blaylock
and her Commercial Credit Corporation; also acted as counsel of the complainant
Mrs. Angel when he prepared the Deed of Sale of a Residential House and Waiver
of Rights Over a <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> for Mrs. Angel in favor of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Blaylock, daughter of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Blaylock.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(2) Respondent,
while acting as counsel for Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Blaylock
and her Commercial Credit Corporation, also acted as counsel of Mrs. Angel when
he proceeded to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and paid <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> Jimenez the sum of twenty two thousand
pesos (P22,000.00) for <span class="SpellE">Dalanan's</span> <span class="SpellE">Kessing</span>
Property.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(3) Respondent was
representing conflicting interests when he simultaneously prepared the Deed of
Sale of the <span class="SpellE">Kessing</span> property in favor of Mrs. Angel
and the Real Estate Mortgage for the same property to be signed by Mrs. Angel
in favor of Mrs. Blaylock and her Commercial Credit Corporation.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(4) Respondent used
Mrs. Angel by pretending to protect her interest as his client in Civil Case
No. 2020-0, when admittedly he was only "forced to help and assist Mrs.
Angel in said case to protect the property of Mrs. Blaylock."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Was the respondent guilty of representing conflicting interests?</p>

<p class="BODY">The specific law applicable in both administrative cases is Rule
15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which provides:</p>

<blockquote>A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interest except by written
consent of all concerned given after full disclosure of the facts.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We prohibit the representation of conflicting interests not only
because the relation of attorney and client is one of trust and confidence of
the highest degree, but also because of the principles of public policy and
good taste.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attorney has the duty to
deserve the fullest confidence of his client and represent him with undivided
loyalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once this confidence is abused,
the entire profession suffers.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The test of the conflict of interest in disciplinary cases
against a lawyer is whether or not the acceptance of a new relation will
prevent an attorney from the full discharge of his duty of undivided fidelity
and loyalty to his client or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or
double-dealing in the performance thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering this criterion and applying it to the present administrative cases,
we find no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the Solicitor General
upholding the complaints against the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the aforementioned acts of the
respondent in representing Blaylock, and at the same time advising <span class="SpellE">Tiania</span>, the opposing party, as in the first administrative
case, and once again representing Blaylock and her interest while handling the
legal documents of another opposing party as in the second case, whether the
said actions were related or totally unrelated, constitute serious misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are improper to the respondent's office
as attorney.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, taking into consideration the advanced age of the
respondent, who would have reached seventy three (73) years, as of this date,
the Court, while uncompromisingly firm in its stand against erring lawyers,
nonetheless appreciates the advance years of the respondent in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> guilty of
malpractice and gross misconduct in violation of the Code of Professional
Responsibility, we hereby SUSPEND him from the practice of law for a period of
one (1) year.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let this Decision be spread upon the personal records of the
respondent and copies thereof furnished to all courts and to the Integrated Bar
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
