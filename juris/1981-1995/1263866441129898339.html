</span>Because he thought that <span class="SpellE">Nestora</span> <span class="SpellE">Horohoro</span> was already dead he decided to bring the <span class="SpellE">rota</span> air electric fan and radio cassette recorder inside
the house of <span class="SpellE">Praxedes</span> <span class="SpellE">Quidang</span>
where <span class="SpellE">Nestora</span> <span class="SpellE">Horohoro</span> was

<p class="BODY">A close analysis of the above information will reveal that it has
sufficiently alleged the proper offense committed which is that of Robbery with
Homicide and fully <span class="GramE">apprises</span> the accused about what he
is facing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the term "with the intent to gain and by the use of
force and violence" precedes the part alleging the "homicide",
the information taken as a whole is sufficient to enable a person of common
understanding to know that the crime charged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">is </span>that of robbery with homicide as the necessary elements of the
said offense are present in the above information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in studiedly correct grammar so that, as argued by the distinguished counsel of
the appellant, technical offenses are accurately presented with all
distinguishing and essential elements characterized beyond question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also states assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arquendo</u></span>
that robbery was committed, the killing was the result of the quarrel between
the victim and <span class="GramE">himself</span> thus, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">homicide was not committed as a consequence
of or on occasion of the robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is without merit.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant’s reason for stabbing the victim is that "when
he saw that his finger was bleeding because of the bite of <span class="SpellE">Nestora</span>
<span class="SpellE">Horohoro’s</span> teeth, he felt so obfuscated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">so </span>he held his knife and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Nestora</span> <span class="SpellE">Horohoro</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This statement is purely self-serving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The more believable reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>the appellant’s craving for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the radio cassette recorder and the electric
fan and his willingness to get them from the appellant whatever the means or
cost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Joseph Lim
reveals that the appellant already had a plan to get not only the radio
cassette but the <span class="SpellE">rota</span> air electric fan as well even
before the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the
appellant, therefore, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only an attempt to
cover-up his plan to get the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">two </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">items as he did not even make mention of an
electric fan to be borrowed from the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

policemen were already there because of the tip that someone was coming back to
sell what were probably hot items.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The homicide then, was committed as a consequence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>or on occasion of the robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that robbery was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 293 of the Revised Penal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Code </span>states:</p>

<p class="BODY">These elements are present in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The intention to gain can be gleaned not only
from the testimony of the businessman-buyer, Joseph Lim but also from the
appellant's own testimony as he would have used the proceeds of the sale of the
radio cassette and electric fan for his fare.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was also the use of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">force

<p class="BODY">The appellant alleges that the aggravating circumstances of
