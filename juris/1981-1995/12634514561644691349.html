Angayao, plaintiff-appellee versus Ramon Agton, defendant-appellant",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  which affirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao in
 Civil Case No. 5977 entitled "Santiago Angayao, Plaintiff-Appellee 
versus Ramon Agton, Defendant-Appellant", the dispositive part of which 
reads:
<blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby ren­dered directing the defendant

</p><p>
On April 5, 1968 Santiago Angayao filed a complaint for recovery of real
 property and damages against Ramon Agton in the Court of First Instance
 of Davao, Branch I, docketed as Civil Case No. 5977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  The land sought to be recovered is a portion containing three (3) 
hectares being a portion of Lot 184 of the cadastral survey of Davao, 
located in Torii, City of Davao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The trial court rendered judgment ordering the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff the land sought to be recovered.
</p><p>
The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the decision of the trial court.
</p><p>
The antecedent facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It appears that previous to the filing of this suit, a civil case
 was filed for and in behalf of the herein plaintiff-appellee (while he 
was then a minor) on or about Oct. 10, 1951, with the Court of First 
Instance of Davao for the recovery of possession of real property with 
damages against the here­in defendant-appellant Ramon Agton and seve­ral
 others.  The case involved a parcel of land known as Lot No. 786, 
Cadastral 102 of Davao City, situated in Baliok, Davao City, and was 
docketed as Civil Case No. 726.  An amicable settlement was entered 
into, among the terms of which appellant obligated him­self to deliver 
to the appellee a parcel of land, more particularly described in 
para­graph 3 of the said amicable settlement, reflected in paragraph 5 
of the complaint in the instant case as follows: </p>
  <p> 'That plaintiff hereby accepts three (3) hectares portion of the 
land in question as a settlement in full of his claim against the 
Defendant, and in consideration thereof hereby agrees to the complete 
termi­nation of this case.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Judgment was rendered in accordance with this amicable settlement, and 
immediately there­after, the defendant therein (appellant here­in), 
pointed out to a parcel of land situated in Toril, Davao, more 
particularly described in paragraph 8 of the instant complaint as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 'A parcel of land (Lot 184-A of the subdivision plan Psd-28181 
being a portion of Lot 184 of the cadastral survey of Davao, G.L.R.O. 
Cad. Record No. 318), situated in the City of Davao.  Bounded on the 
NE., by Lot 180 of Davao Cad., and Lot 184-B of the subdivision plan; on
 the SW by Provincial Road and on the NW., by Lot 182 of Davao; x x x; 
containing an area of Seven­teen Thousand Eight Hundred Eleven Square 
meters (17,811) more or less.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
as the parcel of land subject of the said amicable settlement.  The 
herein plaintiff made demands for the delivery of the said parcel of 
land situated in Toril but the defendant herein promised to deliver the 
said parcel of land to the appellee when the latter attains the age of 
majority.  On the occasion, the appellant, in fact, invited the appellee
 to the premises of the land in question in order to be present in the 
sur­vey thereof for the segregation of that portion which was to be 
given to him.  After said survey, defendant told plaintiff to wait for a
 little while as the delivery of the land would be made after the 
approval of the said survey.  The defendant-appellant continued making 
such promises in fraud of the appellee, taking undue advantage of the 
latter's minority and ignorance, the appellee being an unlettered 
Bagobo.  Inspite of re­peated demands, no delivery of the said par­cel 
of land was made, thus prompting the appellee to file this case before 
the court a quo."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
As stated by the Court of Appeals, the main issue is whether the land 
promised to be delivered by Ramon Agton to Santiago Angayao is the 
parcel of land described in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the complaint or a 
parcel of land described in paragraph 8 thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
The petitioner, Ramon Agton, assigned the following errors allegedly committed by the Court of Appeals:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I </p>
  <p> "RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER HAS 
NOT SPECIFICALLY DENIED THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF FACTS CONSTITUTING 
RESPONDENT ANGAYAO'S CAUSE OF ACTION IN THE PRESENT CASE. </p>
  <p> "II </p>
  <p> "RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING IN TOTO THE 
DECISION OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO IN THE INSTANT CASE."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Anent the first error assigned, the petitioner submits:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the
 answer of herein petitioner Agton does not spe­cifically deny the 
material allegations of the complaint and, therefore, admits the same. </p>
  <p> "Paragraph 2 of petitioner Agton's answer entered the following denial - </p>
  <p> '2. That the defendant specifically denies the alle­gations in paragraphs 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the complaint.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and then proceeded to aver the truth of the matters involved, in the following 'Special &amp; Affirmative Defenses' -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Special and Affirmative Defenses </p>
  <p> “1.  That all the foregoing allega­tions are hereby incorporated 
by refe­rence to form part of these affirmative and special defenses. </p>
  <p> “2.  That since as alleged in para­graph 6 of the complaint 'the 
defendant in Civil Case No. 726 did not own nor had any interest, right 
or participation in Lot No. 786, Cad. 102, or any portion thereof', the 
plaintiff herein and the plaintiff in Civil Case No. 726 had no cause of
 action in fact against the defen­dant in said Civil Case No. 726 so the
 defendant could not have offered as he did not in fact offer, to the 
plaintiff, a portion of 3 hectares of the land des­cribed in paragraph 8
 of the complaint which was then covered by Transfer Certi­ficate of 
Title No. T-2528 in the name of the defendant, and which parcel of land 
was not involved in Civil Case No. 726. </p>
  <p> “3.  That in Civil Case No. 726 the defendant was actually a 
TRUSTEE of the heirs of one CERILA BAGOBA with whose heirs the defendant
 was made a joint defendant. </p>
  <p> “4.  That in the Amicable Settlement in Civil Case No. 726, the 
plaintiff herein was represented by his counsel, who then also 
represented the Guardian Ad Litem. </p>
  <p> “5.  That the said Amicable Settle­ment was approved by this 
Honorable Court and as a matter of fact a decision based thereon was 
rendered by this Honorable Court which decision had long ago become 
final and executed. </p>
  <p> “6.  That way back on July 8, 1953, the said Amicable Settlment 
was confirmed and ratified by the plaintiff through his counsel when 
said counsel filed a 'PETI­TION FOR DETACHMENT OF EXHIBIT', paragraph 3 
of which reads: </p>
  <p>
  '3. That said exhibit is needed for the survey of the portion of the land alloted to the plaintiff.'
  </p>
  <p> “7.  That way back on November 26, 1962, the plaintiff confirmed 
and ratified the termination of Civil Case No. 726 when he filed through
 counsel an 'EX-PARTE MOTION TO WITHDRAW EXHIBITS' paragraph 1 of which 
reads: </p>
  <p>
  '1. That the above-entitled case has already been terminated as early as 1952';
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
on which date of confirmation and ratifi­cation the plaintiff was more 
than 28 years old, hence, this complaint states no cause of action 
against the defendant.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “8.  That the plaintiff became of the age of majority way back in 
1954, hence, if at all the plaintiff has a cause of action against the 
defendant, it should have been filed at the latest, four years after 
1954 or in 1958 to be exact. </p>
  <p> “9.  That the present action assail­ing the validity of the 
Amicable Settle­ment in Civil Case No. 726 has already prescribed.  (pp.
 1-13, R.A.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
"It is significant to note from the above-quoted portions of the answer of petitioner Agton, that the same tender issues."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
It is to be noted that the allegations in the special and affirmative 
defenses refer to paragraphs 6 and 8 of the complaint which read:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "6.  That defendant Ramon Agton, who was also the defendant in 
Civil Case No. 726, did not own nor had any interest, right or 
participation in Lot No. 786, Cad. 102, or in any portion thereof, and 
he could not have possibly ceded or transferred a portion of THREE (3) 
HECTARES of said Lot to plaintiff Santiago Angayao in consideration of 
the amicable settlement (Annex "A") on February 28, 1952, as in fact, up
 to the present date, no delivery of the portion mentioned in the 
amicable settlement has been made by defendant Ramon Agton to plaintiff;
 </p>
  <p>
    x x x
  </p>
  <p> "8.  That plaintiff herein, on or about February 28, 1952, signed 
the docu­ment, amicable settlement, without under­standing fully the 
contents thereof, and when the same was read, interpreted and explained 
to him by the defendant, plain­tiff was made to understand that the 
por­tion of 3 hectares mentioned in said amicable settlement was a 
separate lot situated in the poblacion of Toril, Davao City, more 
particularly described as follows: </p>
  <p> 'A parcel of land (Lot 184-A of the subdivision plan Psd-28181 
being a portion of Lot 184 of the cadastral survey of Davao, G.L.R.O. 
Cad. Record No. 318), situated in the City of Davao.  Bounded on the 
NE., by Lot 180 of Davao Cad.; on the SE., by Lot 180 of Davao Cad.; and
 Lot 184-B of the subdivision plan; on the SW by the Provincial plan; on
 the SW. by the Provincial Road and on the NW., by Lot 182 of Davao 
Cad.; x x x; containing an area of SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED 
ELEVEN SQUARE METERS (17,811) more or less.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing allegations are partly admitted and denied in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the answer which allege:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “4.  That the defendant partly admits and partly denies the 
allegations in paragraph 6 of the complaint, the facts being as they are
 recited in the affir­mative and special defenses herein. </p>
  <p> “5.  That the defendant specifically denies the allegations in 
paragraph 8 of the complaint, the facts being as they are recited in the
 affirmative and special defenses herein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> Paragraph 2 of the answer only generally denies paragraphs 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the com­plaint which read: </p>
  <p> "7.  That the true circumstance that transpired during the 
discussion of the settlement in Civil Case No. 726 was that, Santiago 
Angayao, a minor and an uneduca­ted Bagobo and who was not assisted by 
his guardian ad litem in the discussion was of­fered by defendant Ramon 
Agton, a portion of three (3) hectares in the poblacion of Toril, Davao 
City, for and in consideration of the amicable settlement; </p>
  <p>
  x x x
  </p>
  <p> “9.  That in the afternoon of February 28, 1952, after the 
amicable settlement was signed by Santiago Angayao, defendant Ramon 
Agton brought the plaintiff in defendant's car to Toril, Davao City, and
 upon arri­ving thereat, defendant pointed to the plaintiff the very 
portion of 3 hectares in the poblacion of Toril, Davao City, 
particularly the property above-mentioned; </p>
  <p> “10. That defendant promised the plaintiff that the former would 
deliver the possession of the said 3 hectares portion of his land to 
plaintiff upon plaintiff's reaching the age of majority; </p>
  <p> “11. That for several instances, defendant had assured the 
plaintiff, a distant relative of defendant, that posse­ssion of the 3 
hectares of land in the Toril poblacion would be delivered when 
plaintiff, upon reaching the age of majo­rity, demanded on the defendant
 the deli­very of the parcel of land; </p>
  <p> “12. That defendant, in utter bad faith and in an inequitable act,
 after offering various pretexts, later on assured plaintiff that 
delivery of the land would finally be made by him (defendant) after all 
his children are through with their studies; </p>
  <p> “13. That defendant is holding and possessing the above-mentioned 
property in trust for the benefit of plaintiff; that said property has 
not passed to the hands of any purchaser for value and in good faith; </p>
  <p> “14. That sometime in September, 1962, defendant requested the 
plaintiff, who was then in Baliok, Davao City, to come to Toril 
poblacion, Davao City, in order to be present in the survey of the land 
and the segregation of that por­tion to be given to him; that upon 
plain­tiff's arrival in Toril poblacion, he joined the defendant who was
 with four other men with survey chains and poles and who were 
introduced by defendant to plaintiff as the survey party; that 
plain­tiff was with the defendant when they were locating the concrete 
monuments marking the points of the land during the said survey; and 
that after said survey, defendant again told plaintiff to wait for a 
little time because the delivery of the land would be made after the 
approval of the survey; </p>
  <p> “15. That defendant has committed fraud taken undue advantage over
 plain­tiff's minority and ignorance when, in order that plaintiff would
 sign the ami­cable settlement in Civil Case No. 726, defendant promised
 to cede in favor of plaintiff a portion of 3 hectares of his land in 
the Toril poblacion and that, later on, when plaintiff began demanding 
the fulfillment of the obligation, defendant acted inequitably by 
leading the plaintiff to believe that delivery of the land would be made
 as promised."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The denial in paragraph 2 of the answer is not supported by the 
substance of the matters which the defendant will rely upon to support 
his denial as required by Section 10, Rule 8, Revised Rules of Court.
</p><p>
The petitioner's special and affirmative defenses do not controvert the 
allegations in paragraphs 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the 
complaint.  The alle­gations in the special and affirmative defenses 
refer to paragraphs 6 and 8 of the complaint.
</p><p>
It is clear from the foregoing that paragraph 2 of the answer is not a 
specific denial.  An answer which merely "denies generally and 
specifically each and every allegation contained in each and every 
paragraph of the complaint" is but a general denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  A denial does not become specific merely because it is qualified by that word.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  The effect is that the material allegations in paragraphs 7, 9, 10, 
11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the complaint are deemed admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Court of Appeals did not commit the first error assigned.
</p><p>
The petitioner submits that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the 
decision of the trial court and sustaining "respondent Angayao's claim, 
in spite of clear evidence to the contrary, and the absence of evidence 
to establish the fact that petitioner AGton obligated himself to deliver
 3 hectares of the Toril Lot (Lot No. 184-A), virtually ignoring the 
final decision between the parties in Civil Case No. 726 which 
constitutes res judicata."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  The issue raised is factual.
</p><p>
The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff Santiago Angayao in view of the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The Court is convinced that the three hectares mentioned in the 
amicable settle­ment have never been delivered to plaintiff Santiago 
Angayao.  And as stated elsewhere in this decision, the defendant is 
deemed to have admitted in his answer that he made the plaintiff 
understand that the three hectares mentioned in the amicable settle­ment
 ????? a portion of a lot situated in Toril, Davao City, Lot No. 184-A 
of the subdivision plan Psd-28181 being a portion of Lot 184 of the 
Cadastral Survey of Davao, G.L.R.O. Cad. Record No. 318 covered by 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2528 of the Register of Deeds of 
Davao in the name of the defendant, which he promised to deliver to the 
plaintiff but has not delivered up to now. </p>
  <p> "The defendant set up the defense that the action assailing the 
validity of the amicable settlement had prescribed.  But the 
above-entitled case is not an action for annulment of the amicable 
settlement.  It is an action for recovery of real property which the 
defendant promised to deliver to the plaintiff and which action 
prescribes in thirty years.  The judgment in Civil Case No. 726 based on
 the amicable settlement was novated by the promise of the defendant to 
deliver the three hectares covered by Trans­fer Certificate of Title No.
 2528 of the Register of Deeds of Davao in his name."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Court of Appeals found that the land promised by Ramon Agton to be 
delivered to Santiago Angayao is the land described in paragraph 8 of 
the complaint be­cause:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Regarding error 2, suffice it to say that enough testimonial 
evidence was intro­duced, apart from that already judicially admitted by
 the appellant, that the land sought to be recovered was not the same 
land mentioned in the amicable settlement in Civil Case No. 726 but the 
parcel of land in the poblacion of Toril, Davao, which was described in 
paragraph 8 of the appellee's complaint, as gleaned from the testimony 
of Angayao, as follows: </p>
  <p> "Q   Mr. Angayao, you alleged in your complaint and had been 
admitted by the defendant in his answer, that you had been offered by 
the defendant 3 hectares of his land in the poblacion of Toril in 
con­sideration of the settlement in Civil Case No. 726, how many times 
did you make demands from the defendant for the delivery to you of the 
three hectares which were in consideration of that amicable settlement 
of Civil Case No. 726? </p>
  <p> "x x x </p>
  <p> "A.   Many times." (tsn., pp. 16, 18). </p>
  <p>
    COURT:
  </p>
  <p> "Q   Did you receive the land consisting of three hectares mentioned in the amicable settlement? </p>
  <p> "A    No, sir. </p>
  <p> "Q   Did you receive the three hectares in the poblacion of Toril 
which ac­cording to you defendant pointed to you to be the three 
hectares mentioned in the document, in the ami­cable settlement? </p>
  <p> "A    He just pointed it to me, but he did not give it to me." (tsn., p. 37) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately, the foregoing testimony stands uncontradicted by the 
records.  It therefore follows that the allegations in paragraph 8 of 
the complaint have been preponderantly proven."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
</p><p>
The record shows that the findings of fact of the trial court and the 
Court of Appeals on the identity of the land which Ramon Agton promised 
to deliver to Santiago Angayao are supported by the evidence.  Said land
 has not been delivered by Ramon Agton to Santiago Angayao.  There is no
 basis for the Supreme Court to set aside said factual findings.
