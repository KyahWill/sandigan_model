				<BR><STRONG>MEDIALDEA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Presented for resolution are three consolidated petitions, all
relating to petitioners' effort to recover one-half (1/2) interest in five lots
which they claim belonged to their late father, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>,
and now to them as the latter's heirs, but which respondents hold adversely.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their claim is embodied in a complaint for "rescission, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, and/or partition with damages" filed
with the then Court of First Instance of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and docketed as Civil Case No. 16374 (now 680), entitled "<span class="SpellE">Bienvenida</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson-Lagniton</span>, et
al. v. <span class="SpellE">Sps</span>. Ester <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
Vinson, et al." This complaint was dismissed by the trial court on motion
of the defendant, herein respondent Norma N. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, on the ground that
petitioners' claim is unenforceable, barred by prior judgment, had prescribed,
and that petitioners were guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the plaintiffs, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, questioned the order directly to this Court and
whose petition for review was docketed as G.R. No. 74757.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other plaintiffs filed an amended notice
of appeal with the trial court signifying their intention to appeal to the
Court of Appeals. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Their notice of appeal
remains up to the present <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They come to this Court by way of petition
for <i>mandamus</i> to compel respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calasara</span> "to act on their notice of appeal"
and to cause the transmittal of the records of Civil Case No. 680 to the Court
of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their petition was docketed
as G.R. No. 79555.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1988</st1:date>, this Court gave due
course to both petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meantime, subsequent to the filing of the complaint, petitioners
also filed a "Motion in Intervention" in the testate estate
proceeding of the deceased Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> of which a
portion of the land they are claiming ostensibly forms a part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="1">January
 4, 1982</st1:date>, the probate court issued an order denying petitioners'
motion to intervene on the ground that their claimed right is already fully
protected considering that they had already filed Civil Case No. 680.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reconsideration of the above order having
been denied they filed with this Court a petition for <b><i>certiorari</i></b>
docketed as G.R. No. 61466 which was given due course on January 7, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 79555, petitioners argue that upon the trial court's
receipt of their <u>amended</u> notice of appeal, it was its ministerial duty
to forward the records of Civil Case No. 680 to the Court of Appeals, and its
failure to do so is correctible by <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the principle invoked is correct, this Court finds the same
inapplicable to petitioners' situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As pointed out by respondents the <u>amended</u> notice of appeal was
filed out of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that
the order (G.R. No. 79555, pp. 53-55, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
of respondent judge, dated <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="4">April 22,
 1986</st1:date>, dismissing Civil Case No. 680 was received by petitioners on <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="5">May
 15, 1986</st1:date>, they filed with the trial court their notice of appeal
(p. 59, <u>Ibid</u>) signifying their intention to elevate the questioned order
to this Court “on the ground that said Order is contrary to law and
jurisprudence.” On May 28, 1986, they filed an <u>amended</u> notice of appeal
(p. 60, <u>Ibid</u>) where they informed the trial court that they would be
appealing instead to the then Intermediate Appellate Court, again on the same
ground above quoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the notice of appeal to this Court was filed on
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, however, has no significance
and did not suspend the running of the 15-day period to appeal (<span class="SpellE">Pamantasan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Lungsod</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Maynila</span> v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, No. <span class="GramE">L-65439, </span><st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 31, 1986</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 143 SCRA 311; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="GramE">Jr. v.

is to be remembered that the correct mode of appeal from decisions or decrees
of Regional Trial Courts to this Court on pure questions of law is by petition
for review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Briefly, under the amendment
introduced by Republic Act No. 5440, a 1968 law, a litigant who invokes the
exclusive jurisdiction of this Court (Sec. 2, R.A. No. 5440) to review
decisions or decrees of inferior courts, in cases in which only errors or
questions of law are involved, must do so by filing a petition for review by <b><i>certiorari</i></b>
in the form and in the manner required for petitions for review by <b><i>certiorari</i></b>
of decisions of the Court of Appeals (Sec. 3, <u>Ibid</u>), outlined in Rule 45
of the Rules of Court (Sec. 25, Interim Rules and Guidelines), and not by
ordinary appeal under Rule 42.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the present set up, no notice of appeal is required.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, within 15 days<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
from receipt of the decision or decree assailed, a petition for review shall be
filed directly with this Court, paying within the same period of time docketing
fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition, however, shall not
be acted upon without proof of service of a copy thereof on the trial court
(Sec. 1, Rule 45, <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Rules of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Review of the decision or decree is not a
matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, and will be granted only
when there are special or important reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
(Sec. 4, <u>Ibid</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In</span> the case at bar, petitioners allowed
the 15-day period to lapse without having filed a petition for review nor paid
the docketing and legal research fund fee with this Court, which acts are
necessary for perfecting their appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead they filed their <u>amended</u> notice of appeal with the trial
court signifying their intention to appeal to the Court of Appeals beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court has consistently ruled that the perfection of an appeal <u>within
the statutory period</u> is a jurisdictional requirement and failure to do so
renders the questioned decision or decree final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and no longer subject to review (Garcia v. <span class="SpellE">Echiverri</span>,
No. <span class="GramE">L-44455, </span><st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 23, 1984</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 132 SCRA 631
citing <span class="SpellE">Acda</span> v. Minister of Labor, No.</span> L-51607,
<st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1982</st1:date>, 119
SCRA 309; Agricultural and Industrial Marketing, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, No. <span class="GramE">L-39515, </span><st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="11"><span class="GramE">November 2, 1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 118 SCRA 49;

this Court had relaxed this rule in a number of instances where to do so would
serve substantial justice (Director of Lands v. <span class="SpellE">Romamban</span>,
No. <span class="GramE">L-36948, </span><st1:date year="1984" day="28" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 28, 1984</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 131 SCRA 431;

782; Castro v. Court of Appeals, No.</span> L-47410, <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1983</st1:date>, 123 SCRA 782), there appears no
reason to apply the exception to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the delay was not excusable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was incumbent upon petitioners to utilize
the <u>correct mode of appeal of decisions or decrees of trial courts to this
Court</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the mistaken choice of
their remedy, they can blame no one but themselves (<span class="SpellE">Yucuanseh</span>
Drug Co. v. NLU, 101 Phil. 409).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
should have known that the filing with the trial court of a notice of appeal to
the Supreme Court was a useless act which could not arrest the running of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> 15-day period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An erroneous application of the law or rules is not an excusable error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, there appears no dispute as to the material facts of
the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The allegation of facts
contained in respondent Norma N. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de <span class="SpellE">Jocson's</span></span> motion to dismiss was
not refuted by petitioners in their opposition thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead their attack was focused on the legal
consequences thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being so, there is
no factual issue which petitioners intend to raise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a pleading (G.R. No. 79555, p. 76, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) they filed with this Court, petitioners
manifested that they seek to appeal to the Court of Appeals because they
"believe there are questions of facts to be resolved ultimately, like the
area of the property sought to be recovered, the damages, cost, and attorney's
fees claimed." But these questions of facts have no relation at all to the
question of the correctness of the order granting the motion to dismiss on the
ground of unenforceability, bar by prior judgment, prescription or <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of
the foregoing, it would be superfluous, and indeed erroneous for this Court to
order the records of Civil Case No. 680 to be forwarded to the Court of Appeals
since <span class="GramE">We</span> have exclusive jurisdiction to review on <b><i>certiorari</i></b>
decisions or decrees of trial courts which involve only errors or questions of
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, and most importantly, on the merits, <span class="GramE">We</span>
see no reason to disturb the order of dismissal of Civil Case No. 680.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, from the given facts petitioners'
cause of action had prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint (G.R. No. 74757, pp. 23-29, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There they alleged that in 1933, their
father, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, together with his sister, <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, inherited five
lots pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>; that Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
entrusted to <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
and her husband, Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, possession of his
share in the lots for the spouses’ use and enjoyment during their lifetime on
condition that they pay for the taxes thereon; that as a consequence, the
spouses and their successors-in-interest have been in possession of the lots in
dispute since 1933; that it was further agreed that upon the spouses' demise,
the interest of Agustin in the lots would revert to him or his
successors-in-interest; that Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
predeceased the spouses in 1954, his wife died much earlier in 1931; that with
Agustin's demise the petitioners, being the only compulsory heirs, became the
owners of the one-half undivided interest of Agustin on the lots; that further,
based on the foregoing, a trust relationship was created between the spouses <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> and Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> on the one hand and the petitioners on the other,
the former having the obligation to deliver to the latter Agustin's share; that
thereafter <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
died; that contrary to the above described arrangement, Ester <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> (married to <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Vinzon</span>), the adopted daughter of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> and Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>,
together with the latter, caused the transfer of the tax declaration of the
properties in their names; that it was only at the wake of Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, who died in July 1981, when petitioners came to
know of the above described circumstances and of the fraud committed against
their father and to them as heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners prayed <b><i>inter</i></b> <span class="SpellE"><b><i>alia</i></b></span>
that they be declared the legal owners of one-half of the five lots and
entitled to possession thereof, and that they be awarded rentals for the use of
the property, and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was directed against the private respondents - the
spouses Ester <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Vinson with Norma N. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span> de <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
(the second wife of Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>) representing the
testate estate of Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, being the named
executrix thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aforementioned,
defendant executrix filed a Motion to Dismiss (pp. 30-37, <u>Ibid</u>) on the
ground that petitioners' cause of action being based on express trust (between
Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>) is unenforceable under Article 1443 of the Civil
Code; that it is barred by prior judgment because one-third (1/3) of the five
lots which the petitioners are claiming was adjudicated to Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> and the remaining two-thirds (2/3) thereof were
adjudicated to Ester <span class="SpellE">Jocson-Vinzon</span> in the intestate
estate proceeding of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
(SP No. 6650), where the lots were reported to be the <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>
properties of the deceased, and in which proceeding the petitioners themselves
sought to intervene, though <span class="SpellE">unsuccesfully</span>, not as
adverse claimants to the estate but as heirs of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>; that it is barred by prescription (citing
Article 1141, Civil Code) and <span class="SpellE">laches</span> because the lots
had been registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> since 1935 while petitioners' complaint was filed
only in 1981, and further considering that the properties were "claimed in
absolute registered ownership" by the estate of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> in 1961 and later by Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> and Ester <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> <span class="SpellE">Vinzon</span> who partitioned the lots with the intestate court's
approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">An opposition (pp. 57-61, <u>Ibid</u>) was filed by petitioners
where they pointed out that there was no express trust alleged by them but
rather implied trust; that their claim is not barred by prior judgment because
Special Proceeding No. 6650 has a different subject matter and cause of action
than Civil Case No. 680; that the registration by <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> of the realties in her name was illegal, and
the defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and prescription is a
confession of wrongdoing or guilt; that trustees are disabled to acquire the
property under trust; and they are not guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
because they had no previous knowledge of the fraud committed by respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing undisputed facts, the trial court, as
aforementioned, dismissed petitioners' complaint in an order (pp. 4-5, <u>Ibid</u>),
dated April 22, 1986, the essential part of which reads, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Records show that after the death of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> in 1961 an
Intestate <span class="GramE">proceedings</span> was instituted in court to
settle her estate (S.P. No. 6650).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
said special proceedings the heirs of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
attempted to intervene, which was however <span class="SpellE">dis</span>-allowed
because the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> were not heirs of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is worthwhile to note in this proceedings
that Lot Nos. 572, 571, 2215, 410 and 579 (now Lot Nos. 579 <span class="GramE">A[</span>2214]
and 579 B[2215]) transfer certificates of titles were transferred in the name
of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> way back
in 1933.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid real properties
which comprise the bulk of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> are the same properties subject of this <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further when this case was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1981</st1:date> there was a lapse of 46 long years after
<span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> transferred the titles in her name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs have never been in possession of
the land and the trustee, if any, never recognized the alleged trust
relationship, so that the doctrine in De <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>
vs. De <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> (16 SCRA 489) is not applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides Express trust concerning an immovable
cannot be proved by <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence and action based
on express trust also prescribed [sic] and the property held in trust may be
acquired by adverse possession from the moment the trust is repudiated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">prescriptibility</span>
of an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> based on implied or
constructive <span class="GramE">trust,</span> is now a settled question in this
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It prescribes in ten years
(<span class="SpellE">Escay</span> vs. CA, 61 SCRA 371).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The filing of this case in 1981 long after
the death of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
in 1961 and other person involved renders it difficult to determine with
certitude whether plaintiff had really been defrauded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Fraud or breach of trust, ought not lightly
to be imputed to the living, for, the legal presumption is the other way; as to
the dead, who are not here to answer for themselves, it would be the height of
injustice and cruelty to disturb their ashes, and violate the sanctity of the
grave, unless the evidence of fraud is clear, beyond reasonable doubts' (<span class="SpellE">Prevost</span> vs. Grants, 6 <span class="SpellE">Whest</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(US) 481, 498).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, and finding the
motion to dismiss well-taken the same is hereby granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other issues raised in this case being
too technical are brushed aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
case is hereby DISMISSED without pronouncement as to cost."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not necessary to discuss the propriety of each and every
basis of the trial court in dismissing petitioners' complaint, it being
sufficient to focus attention on the matter of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 74757, petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
argued that there could be no prescription in this case because respondents'
predecessors-in-interest had kept from him and his co-plaintiffs knowledge that
they have a participation in the five lots and that it was only during the wake
of Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, who died in 1981, that petitioners
came to know of the fraud committed against them as described in their
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, petitioner pointed
out that by filing a motion to dismiss, respondents, in effect, admitted
"wrong-doing and fraud" on their part.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find this argument unavailing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hypothetically admitting that the petitioner's predecessor-in-interest,
Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, inherited the herein disputed five
lots together with <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>,
the accepted fact is that the latter registered the lots in 1935 as her
exclusive properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By that
registration, <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> announced to the whole world
that the five lots were hers alone and effectively renounced whatever claim
Agustin might have over the properties (Lopez v. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
No. <span class="GramE">L-18788, </span><st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 31, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 10 SCRA 167;
See also <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> v. CA, No.</span> L-39299, <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact of repudiation is not here
contested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners called the act of
<span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> as illegal and in violation of the will of
her father. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>This may be so, and
petitioners may call <span class="SpellE">Natalia's</span> registration of the
lots by any other name but from that time, she held the property adverse to
Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Any trust relationship, either express or resulting trust, which <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> and Agustin intended to bind themselves with
respect to the lots was renounced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
any constructive trust which might have arisen by <span class="SpellE">Natalia's</span>
fraudulent act cannot anymore be enforced considering that before the present
Civil Code, the longest period of prescription is 10 years (Diaz v. <span class="SpellE">Gorrido</span>, 103 Phil. 261 [1958]), and Agustin <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> never filed an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever right he might have had over the
five lots was extinguished 10 years after 1935, either because <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> had acquired the properties by acquisitive
prescription or Agustin's cause of action had prescribed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, petitioners clearly have
no claim over the disputed lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever claim they might have had, they derived as heirs of Agustin but
as Agustin's right over the lots was extinguished way back in 1945 so was
petitioners'.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, petitioners clearly have no claim
against the estate of Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, and, therefore,
have no reason to intervene in the testate estate proceeding of the deceased. <span class="GramE">G.R. No. 61466, thus, has</span> become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition in 1) G.R. No. 61466 is DENIED
for having become moot and academic; 2) G.R. No. 74757 is DENIED for lack of
merit and the order of the respondent court, dated April 22, 1986, dismissing
civil case no. 16374 (now civil case no. 680) is AFFIRMED; and 3) G.R. No.
79555 is DISMISSED.</p>
