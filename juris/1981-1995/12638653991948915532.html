				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Sentenced to life imprisonment and a P20,000.00 fine for violation
of the Dangerous Drugs Act, the accused-appellant comes before us to plead that
his conviction was a mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
will state at the outset that the mistake was his.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that having learned in the
morning of <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1987</st1:date>,
that a certain Cristy was selling marijuana in <st1:street><st1:address>Fernandez
  St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename>Dagupan</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Capt. Francisco Bustamante of
the Office of Narcotics organized a team composed of Sgt. Florentino Baillo,
Sgt. Feliciano de Vera, and Pat. Maximiano Peralta, to seek him out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The team proceeded to the said street and
there found the accused-appellant in front of the Rodela Theater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Baillo approached him and offered to buy
marijuana, for which the latter demanded the sum of P15.00 a foil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Baillo agreed. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Cristy then asked a man called Alex, who was
passing by, to get the marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alex
returned at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time> that same
morning and upon Cristy’s instructions handed an object wrapped in aluminum
foil to Baillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Baillo unwrapped the
package and found it contained dried marijuana leaves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then made the pre-arranged signal of
removing his sun-glasses, and the other members of the team, who had
unobtrusively positioned themselves some ten meters away, moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arrested both Cristy and Alex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way to the police station, however,
Alex jumped off the jeep where they were riding and escaped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cristy, who was later identified as Ernesto
Avila, was left to face the charge. </p>

<p class="BODY">The above narration was made at the trial by Baillo, Peralta and
De Vera.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Marieta Bien, forensic chemist of the National Bureau of Investigation,
testified on the results of her microscopic, chemical and chromatographic
examination of the marijuana after it had been turned over to the NBI by De
Vera.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Avila denied the charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said that in the morning in question he was in front of their shop
attending to the wood lamination of some pictures when Sgt. Baillo accosted him
and asked him if he knew a person by the name of Alex Querrer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He averred he pointed to Alex, who happened to
be passing by, and Baillo left to approach Alex, whereupon he himself went
inside the shop to attend to his work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly afterwards, Baillo, accompanied by two other persons in civilian
clothes, returned and, holding him by the wrist, told him to come with them and
Alex for interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rode in a
jeep, but on the way Alex jumped off and escaped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He himself stayed put because he was
terrified of the men's firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
taken to a house in Tapuac St. and told he would be released if he would reveal
the whereabouts of Alex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he could
not, he was detained at police headquarters and eventually charged with selling
marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
His testimony was corroborated by his sisters, Josephine and Fermina Avila.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After assessing the evidence of the parties, Judge Crispin C.
Labong of the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan City found the accused-appellant
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime imputed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We defer to his decision in view of his
superior opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and to test their
credibility on the stand under direct and cross examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of a showing that they were
reached arbitrarily or without sufficient basis, the factual findings of the
trial judge are received with much respect by, and indeed are binding on, even
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, the accused-appellant points to certain
discrepancies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, but we find they
are only minor inconsistencies that do not militate against the validity of his
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have repeatedly
declared, the witnesses testifying on the same event do not have to be
consistent in every detail as differences in recollections or viewpoints or
impressions are inevitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Total recall
or perfect symmetry is not required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
long as the witnesses concur on the material points, slight differences in
their remembrance of the details do not reflect on the essential veracity of
their testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">The non-presentation by the prosecution of the money used for the
buy-bust operation was not, contrary to the defense theory, a fatal
omission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no rule that such
kind of evidence is indispensable in a prosecution for the illegal sale of
dangerous drugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marijuana itself
was offered as an exhibit.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It was properly marked, not only by Baillo, who wrote the name of Avila and
then affixed his own signature on the aluminum foil wrapper, but also Bien, who
signed the back of the envelope where she placed the marijuana after her
examination, and the masking tape she used to seal the envelope.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that the prosecution witnesses who conducted the
buy-bust operation had not known Avila before they arrested him on August 11,
1987, and so had no reason to arrest and charge him without cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused?appellant has not shown any
evil motive that may have prompted them to accuse him unjustly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By contrast, it is not unnatural that when
Avila’s sisters testified, their statements under oath were made out of loyalty
more to their brother than to the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the trial court has not erred in finding, on the
basis of the evidence on record, that the accused-appellant committed the crime
of selling a prohibited narcotic in violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so he must be punished as the law
demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It truly is tragic that a man
of only 24 years must spend the rest of his life behind bars for his
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the greater tragedy is in
the damaged lives of thousands of our youth who have been ensnared the evil of
drug addiction by heartless persons like the convict in the dock.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>
with costs against the accused-appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
