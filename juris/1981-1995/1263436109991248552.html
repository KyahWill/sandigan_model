<p class="BODY"><span style="">Planters
Products, Inc. (PPI), purchased from </span>Mitsubishi International Corporation
(MITSUBISHI) of New York, U.S.A., 9,329.7069 metric tons (M/T) of Urea 46%
fertilizer which the latter shipped in bulk on 16 June 1974 aboard the cargo
vessel M/V "Sun Plum" owned by private respondent Kyosei Kisen
Kabushiki Kaisha (KKKK) from Kenai, Alaska, U.S.A., to Poro Point, San
Fernando, La Union, Philippines, as evidenced by Bill of Lading No. KP-1 signed
by the master of the vessel and issued on the date of departure.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 May 1974, or prior to its voyage, a time charter-party on
the vessel M/V "Sun Plum" pursuant to the Uniform General Charter<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

in Tokyo, Japan.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Riders to the aforesaid charter-party starting from par. 16 to 40 were attached
to the pre-printed agreement.  Addenda
Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 to the charter-party were also subsequently entered into on
the 18th, 20th, 21st and 27th of May 1974, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before loading the fertilizer aboard the vessel, four (4) of her
holds<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
were all presumably inspected by the charterer's representative and found fit
to take a load of <span style="">urea in bulk pursuant to par. 16 of the charter-party which
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"16.  x x x x At loading port, notice of readiness
to be accomplished by certificate from National Cargo Bureau inspector or substitute
appointed by charterers for his account certifying the vessel's readiness to

<p class="BODY">After the Urea fertilizer was loaded in bulk by stevedores hired
by and under the supervision of the shipper, the steel hatches were closed with
heavy iron lids, covered with three (3) layers of tarpaulin, then tied with
steel bonds.  The hatches remained
closed and tightly sealed throughout the entire voyage.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arrival of the vessel at her port of call on 3 July 1974,
the steel pontoon hatches were opened with the use of the vessel's boom.  Petitioner unloaded the cargo from the holds
into its steel-bodied dump trucks which were parked alongside the berth, using
metal scoops attached to <span style="">the </span>ship,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the charter-party (which provided for
an F.I.O.S. clause).<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> The

<p class="BODY">Each time a dump truck was filled up, its load of Urea was
covered with tarpaulin before it was transported to the consignee's warehouse
located some fifty (50) meters from the wharf.  Midway to the warehouse, the trucks were made to pass through a weighing
scale where they were individually weighed for the purpose of ascertaining the
net weight of <span style="">the
cargo.  The port area was windy, certain
portions of the route to the warehouse were sandy and the weather was variable,
raining occasionally while the discharge was in progress.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The
petitioner's warehouse was made of corrugated galvanized iron (GI) sheets, with
an opening at the front where the dump trucks entered and unloaded the
fertilizer on the warehouse floor.  Tarpaulins and GI sheets were placed in-between and alongside the trucks
to contain spillages of the fertilizer.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It took eleven (11) days for PPI to unload the cargo, from 5 July
to 18 July 1974 (except July 12th, 14th and 18th).<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> A
private marine and cargo surveyor, Cargo Superintendents Company Inc. (CSCI),
was hired by PPI to determine the "outturn" of the cargo shipped, by
taking <span style="">draft readings of the
vessel prior to and after discharge.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The survey report submitted
by CSCI to the consignee (PPI) dated 19 July 1974 revealed a shortage in the
cargo of 106.726 M/T and that a portion of the Urea fertilizer approximating 18
M/T was contaminated with dirt.  The
same results were contained in a Certificate of Shortage/Damaged Cargo dated 18
July 1974 prepared by PPI which showed that the cargo delivered was indeed
short of 94.839 M/T and about 23 M/T were rendered unfit for commerce, having
been polluted with sand, rust and dirt.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently,
PPI sent a claim letter dated 18 December </span>1974 to Soriamont Steamship
Agencies (SSA), the resident agent of the carrier, KKKK, for P245,969.31
representing the cost of the alleged shortage <span style="">i</span>n the goods shipped and the diminution in value of that <span style="">p</span>ortion said to have been contaminated
with dirt.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent SSA explained that they were not able to respond to
the consignee's claim for payment because, according to them, what they
received was just a request for shortlanded certificate and not a formal claim,
and that <span style="">this
"request" was denied by them because they "had nothing to do
with the discharge of the shipment.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence, on
18 July 1975, PPI filed an action for damages with the Court of First Instance
of Manila.  The defendant carrier argued
that the strict public policy governing common carriers does not apply to them
because they have become private carriers by reason of the provisions of the
charter-party.  The court </span><i><span style="">a quo </span></i><span style="">however
sustained the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant carrier for the
value of the goods lost or damaged when it ruled thus:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner PPI appeals to us by way of a petition for review
assailing the decision of the Court of Appeals.  Petitioner theorizes that the <i>Home Insurance </i>case has no
bearing on the present controversy because the issue raised therein is the
validity of a stipulation in the charter?<span style="">party delimiting the liability of
the shipowner for loss or damage </span><span style="">to
</span><span style="">goods
caused by want of due deligence on its part or </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">of its manager to make the vessel seaworthy </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">all
respects, and not whether the presumption of negligence provided under the
Civil Code applies only to common carriers and not to private carriers.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">
Petitioner further argues that since the possession and control of the vessel
remain with </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">shipowner,
absent any stipulation to the contrary, </span><span style="">such </span><span style="">shipowner should be made liable for the negligence of the
captain and crew.  In fine, PPI faults
the appellate court in not applying the presumption of negligence against
respondent carrier, and instead shifting the </span><i><u><span style="">onus probandi</span></u></i><i><span style=""> </span></i><span style="">on the shipper to show want of due
deligence on the part of the carrier, when he was not even at hand to witness
what transpired during the entire voyage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the primordial issue here is whether <span style="">a </span>common carrier becomes a private
carrier by reason of a charter-party; in the negative, whether the shipowner in
the instant case was able to prove that he had exercised that <span style="">degree </span><span style="">of
diligence required of him under the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is said that etymology is the basis of reliable judicial
decisions in commercial cases.  This
being so, we find it fitting to first define important terms which are relevant
to our discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A
"charter-party" is defined as a contract by which an </span>entire
ship, or some principal part thereof, <span style="">is
</span>let by the owner to another person for a specified time or use;<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
a contract of affreightment by which the owner of a ship or other vessel lets
the whole or a part of her to a merchant or other person for the conveyance of
goods, on a particular <span style="">voyage,
in consideration of the payment of freight;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Charter parties are of two
types:  (a) contract of affreightment
which involves the use of shipping space on vessels leased by the owner in part
or as a whole, to carry goods for others; and, (b) charter by demise or
bareboat charter, by the terms of which the whole vessel is let to the
charterer with a transfer to him of its entire command and possession and
consequent control over its navigation, including the master and the crew, who
are his servants.  Contract of
affreightment may either be time charter, <span style="">wherein the vessel is leased to the
charterer for a fixed period of time, or voyage charter, wherein the ship is
leased for a single voyage.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">In both cases, the charter?party
provides for the hire of the vessel only, either for a determinate period of
time or for a single or consecutive voyage, the shipowner to supply the ship</span><span style="">'</span><span style="">s stores, pay for the wages of </span><span style="">the master </span><span style="">and the
crew, and defray the expenses for the maintenance of the ship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other
hand, the term "common or public carrier" is </span><span style="">defined in
Art. 1732 of the Civil Code.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The
definition extends to carriers either by land, air or water which hold
themselves out as ready to engage in carrying goods or transporting passengers
or both for </span><span style="">compensation
as </span><span style="">a
public employment and not as a </span><span style="">casual
occupation.  The distinction between a
"common or public carrier" and a "private or special
carrier" lies in the character of the business, such that if the
undertaking is a single transaction, not </span><span style="">a part of the general business or </span><span style="">occupation, although </span><span style="">involving
the carriage of goods for a </span><span style="">fee,
the person or corporation offering such service </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a private carrier.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1733 of the New Civil Code mandates that common carriers,
by reason of the nature of their business, should observe extraordinary
diligence in the vigilance over the goods they carry.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> In
the case of private carriers, however, the exercise of ordinary diligence in
the carriage of goods will suffice.  Moreover, in case of loss, destruction or deterioration of the goods,
common carriers are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted
negligently, and the burden of proving otherwise rests on <span style="">them.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On the contrary, no such
presumption applies to </span>private carriers, for whosoever alleges damage to

was the negligence of the carrier.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not
disputed that respondent carrier, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the </span>ordinary course of business, operates as a common
carrier, transporting goods indiscriminately for all persons.  When petitioner chartered the vessel M/V
"Sun Plum", the ship captain, its officers and compliment were under
the employ of the shipowner and therefore continued to be under its direct
supervision and control.  Hardly then
can we charge <span style="">the
charterer, a stranger to the crew and to the ship, with the duty of caring for
his cargo when the charterer did not have any control of the means in doing </span><span style="">so.  </span><span style="">This is evident </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the
present case considering that the steering of the </span><span style="">ship, the </span><span style="">manning of
the decks, the determination of the course of the voyage and other technical
incidents of maritime navigation were all consigned to the officers and crew
who were screened, chosen and hired by the shipowner.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

such, notwithstanding the charter of the whole or portion of a vessel by one or
more persons, provided the charter <span style="">is </span>limited
to the ship only, as in the case of a time-charter or voyage-charter.  It <span style="">is
</span>only when the charter includes both the vessel and its crew, as in a
bareboat or demise that a common carrier becomes private, at least insofar as
the particular voyage covering the charter-party is concerned.  Indubitably, a shipowner in a time or voyage
charter retains possession and control of the ship, although her holds may, for
the moment, be the property of the <span style="">charterer.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent carrier's heavy reliance on the case of <i>Home
Insurance Co. v. American Steamship Agencies, supra, </i>is misplaced for the
reason that the <span style="">meat of </span>the
controversy therein was the validity of a stipulation in the charter?party
exempting the shipowner from liability for loss due to the negligence of its
agent, and not the effects of a special charter on common carriers.  At any rate, the rule in the United States
that a ship chartered by a single shipper to carry special cargo is not a
common carrier,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>

of goods by sea requires a more exacting interpretation of admiralty laws, more
particularly, the rules governing common carriers.</p>

her, the case is different; the shipowner <span style="">is

her services only are let, the same grounds for imposing a strict
responsibility exist, whether he is employed by one or many.  The master and the crew are in each case his

deposition taken on 19 April 1977 before the Philippine Consul and Legal
Attache in the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo, Japan, testified that before the

and fumigated.  After completing the
loading of the cargo in bulk in the ship's holds, the steel pontoon hatches were
closed and sealed with iron lids, then covered with three (3) layers of
serviceable tarpaulins which were tied with steel bonds.  The hatches remained close and tightly
sealed while the ship was in transit as the weight of the steel covers made it
impossible for a person to open without the use of the ship's boom.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, the presumption of negligence on the part of respondent
carrier has been efficaciously overcome by the showing of extraordinary zeal
and assiduity exercised by the carrier in the care of the cargo.  This was confirmed by respondent appellate
court thus -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x x Be that as it may, contrary to the trial court's
finding, <u>the record of the </u><u><span style="">instant
</span>case discloses ample evidence showing that defendant carrier was not
negligent in performing its obligations</u>.  Particularly, the following testimonies of plaintiff-appellee's own
witnesses clearly show absence of negligence by the defendant carrier; that the
hull of the vessel at the time of the discharge of the cargo was sealed and
nobody could open the same except in the presence of the owner of the cargo and
the representatives of the vessel (TSN, 20 July 1977, p. 14); that the cover of
the hatches was made of steel and it was overlaid with tarpaulins, three layers
of tarpaulins and therefore their contents were protected from the weather
(TSN, 5 April 1978, p. 24); and, that to open these hatches, the seals would
have to be broken, all the seals were found to be intact (TSN, 20 July 1977,
pp. 15-16)" (underscoring Supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The period during which private respondent was to observe the
degree of diligence required of it as a public carrier began from the time the
cargo was unconditionally placed in its charge after the vessel's holds were
duly inspected and passed scrutiny by the shipper, up to and until the vessel
reached its destination and its hull was re-examined by the consignee, but
prior to unloading.  This is clear from the
limitation clause agreed upon by the parties in the Addendum to the standard
"GENCON" time charter-party which provided for an F.I.O.S., meaning,
that the loading, stowing, trimming and discharge of the cargo was to be done
by the charterer, free from all risk and expense to the carrier.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Moreover,
a shipowner is liable for damage to the cargo resulting from improper stowage
only when the stowing is done by stevedores employed by him, and therefore
under his control and supervision, not when the same </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">done by the consignee or stevedores
under the employ of the latter.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1734 of the New Civil Code provides that common carriers
are not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the goods if
caused by the character of the goods or defects in the packaging or in the
containers.  The Code of Commerce also
provides that all losses and deteriorations which the goods may suffer during
the transportation by reason of fortuitous event, <i>force majeure, </i>or the
inherent defect of the goods, shall be for the account and risk of the shipper,
and that proof of these accidents is incumbent upon the carrier.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The

from the <span style="">preceding </span>causes if it is

his having failed to take the precautions which usage has established among
careful persons.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent carrier presented a witness who testified on the
characteristics of the fertilizer shipped and the expected risks of bulk
shipping.  Mr. Estanislao Chupungco, a
chemical engineer working with Atlas Fertilizer, described Urea as a chemical
compound consisting mostly of ammonia and carbon monoxide compounds which are
used as fertilizer.  Urea also contains
46% nitrogen and is highly soluble in water.  However, during storage, nitrogen and ammonia do not normally evaporate
even on a long voyage, provided that the temperature inside the hull does not
exceed eighty (80) degrees centigrade.  Mr. Chupungco further added that in unloading fertilizer in bulk with
the use of a clamped shell, losses due to spillage during such operation
amounting to one percent (1%) against the bill of lading is deemed
"normal" or "tolerable." The primary cause of these
spillages is the clamped shell which does not seal very tightly.  Also, the wind tends to blow away some of
the materials during the unloading process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dissipation of quantities of fertilizer, or its deterioration
in value, is caused either by an extremely high temperature in its place of
storage, or when it comes <span style="">in </span>contact
with water.  When Urea is drenched in
water, either fresh or saline, some of its particles dissolve.  But the salvaged portion which is in liquid
form still remains potent and usable although no longer saleable in its
original market value.</p>

<p class="BODY">The probability of the cargo being damaged or getting mixed or
contaminated with foreign particles was made greater by the fact that the
fertilizer was transported in "bulk," thereby exposing it to the
inimical effects of the elements and the grimy condition of the various pieces
of equipment used in transporting and hauling it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of respondent carrier also showed that it was highly
improbable for sea water to seep into the vessel's holds during the voyage
since the hull of the vessel <span style="">was </span>in
good condition and her hatches were tightly closed and firmly sealed, making
the M/V "Sun Plum" in all respects seaworthy to carry the cargo she
was chartered for.  If there was loss or
contamination of the cargo, it was more likely to have occurred while the same
was being transported from the ship to the dump trucks and finally to he
consignee’s warehouse.  This may be
gleaned from the testimony of the marine and cargo surveyor of CSCI who
supervised the unloading.  He explained
that the 18 M/T of alleged "bad order cargo" as contained in their
report to PPI was just an approximation or estimate made by them <u>after</u>
the fertilizer was discharged from the vessel and segregated from the rest of
the cargo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that it was in the month of July when the vessel
arrived port and unloaded her cargo.  It
rained from time to time at the harbor area while the cargo was being
discharged according to the supply officer of PPI, who also testified that it
was windy at the waterfront and along the shoreline where the dump trucks
passed enroute to the consignee's warehouse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, we agree with respondent carrier that bulk shipment of
highly soluble goods like fertilizer carries with it the risk of loss or
damage.  More so, with a variable
weather condition prevalent during its unloading, as was the case at bar.  This is a risk the shipper or the owner of
the goods has to face.  Clearly,
respondent carrier has sufficiently proved the inherent character of the goods
which makes it highly vulnerable to deterioration; as well as the inadequacy of
its packaging which further contributed to the loss.  On the other hand, no proof was adduced by the petitioner showing
that the carrier was remiss in the exercise of due diligence in order to
minimize the loss or damage to the goods it carried.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

TSN, 5 April 1978, pp. 7-8.  “Drop
survey" is the drop of the vessel showing certain meters or centimeters of
the vessel.  In the ship there is a
draft from one meter upward.  When the vessel
arrives, (CSCI) conducted initial draft survey before discharging, together
with the ship's representative by getting the draft forward and aft.  They divided it by 2 to get the mean draft
and the average draft.  After getting
the mean draft, they got the displacement scale of the vessel to show certain
tons of the ship, then deducted the non-cargo weight, like the fuel oil, the
fresh water.  Finally, the total load of
the ship is taken.  After discharging,
CSCI went over same procedure to get the weight of the vessel.  These figures were then subtracted from the
total load of the ships to get the weight of the cargo.</p>
