<blockquote>"On January 3, 1972 the plaintiffs filed a complaint to remove
the cloud and quiet the title over their property pursuant to the provisions of
Article 476 of the Civil Code.  The
disputed property is a 213,083 square meter parcel of land at Tarragona, Davao
Oriental denominated as Lot 2642 of the Mati Cadastre.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In their answer filed on January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">24, </span>1972, the defendants included a counterclaim to nullify the
plaintiffs' certificate of title, to order the plaintiffs to vacate the
disputed land, and to pay attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The plaintiffs are the registered owners of Lot 2642.  The original <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">certificate of title was issued on December 17, 1964 in the name of
Feliciano Carreon pursuant to a decree in </span>a cadastral proceedings.  On March 18, 1969 a transfer certificate of title
was issued in the names of plaintiffs as heirs of Feliciano Carreon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On October 12, 1971 the defendants annotated on the plaintiffs'
certificate of title an affidavit of adverse claim.  This was the cloud sought to be removed by the plaintiffs in their
action to quiet title.  According to the
plaintiffs, the defendants' annotation on their title was a decision of the
Supreme Court in <u>Paciencia Lim </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Serrano
v. Court of Appeals</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>(33

Lot 2642 in the defendants-appellees' favor.  Not having been parties in that case, the plaintiffs stated that
decision is not effective against them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendants asked for the nullification and voiding of the plaintiffs'
certificate of title in their counterclaim because -</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)  Lot 2642 was the subject of a public land
application of the late Antonio Maguinsawan from whom the defendants trace
their rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) There was a
pending cadastral case No. N-25, N-326 wherein Lot No. 2642 was claimed not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">only </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">by the </span>late Feliciano Carreon but also defendant Hermila
Cartagena and Paciencia <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lim Serrano.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)   The alleged orders supposedly signed by Judge
Numeriano P. Napoles as a result of which a decree of registration was issued
in favor of the late Feliciano Carreon could not have been issued because Lot
2642 was a contested lot and Judge Napoles was a municipal judge and not the
judge of a court of first instance plus the absence of the supposed orders in
favor of Feliciano Carreon in a long decision adjudicating non-contested lots
in the cadastral proceedings.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petition is devoid of
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the first issue raised
by petitioners that there could be no reconveyance of the property because the
respondents never alleged ownership and fraud before the trial court, We agree
with the findings of the Court of Appeals which is herein reproduced with
approval:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This allegation cannot be credited.  Practically all the paragraphs of the answer with counterclaim
either assert the ownership of the defendants against that of the plaintiffs or
question the latters' title and ownership<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
as gotten through fraud.  The words
'ownership' and 'fraud' are not magic incantations the absence of which renders
</span>a pleading worthless.  Ownership
and fraud are better expressed in entire <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sentences
and paragraphs illustrating these concepts.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The answer admits the complaints' averments that the defendants
caused an affidavit of adverse claim to be annotated on TCT No T-14292.  The adverse claim was a claim of ownership
by the defendants against plaintiffs’ titled ownership.  The answer admits the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paragraph in the plaintiffs' complaint about
the Supreme Court's decision in L-28332 adjudicating Lot 2642 to the
defendants.  The decision is reiterated
in paragraph 10 of the counterclaim.  </span>Paragraphs
2, 3, and 4 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">counterclaim point
out that a cadastral case over the property is still pending thus showing that
the cadastral title already issued must have been secured through fraud.  Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 narrate the
allegedly questionable circumstances surrounding the challenged orders of the
cadastral judge.  The </span>counterclaim
asks for the voiding ab initio of the certificate of title on the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> ground that there was no legal basis for its
issuance because the Judge never issued the </span>supposed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">orders upon which the title </span>was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">based.  No matter how one reads the answer with counterclaim, it can be
interpreted in only one way - the </span>defendants claiming to be owners are
challenging the validity of the plaintiffs' title allegedly secured through
fraudulent means.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The appellants state that the irregularities were perpetrated by<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> persons other than Feliciano Carreon and </span>suggest
that compensation from the assurance fund is a more proper procedure than an
action for reconveyance.  We do not
think so.  The defendants assert rights
of ownership.  The plaintiffs do not
fall under the class of innocent title holders contemplated in the provisions
on compensation from the assurance fund.  As the lower court observed, the plaintiffs are not innocent purchasers
for value who acquired the land for valuable consideration.  They merely stepped into the shoes of
Feliciano Carreon.  While the
fraudulently acquired title of Feliciano Carreon has been cancelled and a transfer
certificate of title has been issued in the names of his heirs, the latter title
may still be cancelled and the property reconveyed to the real owners.  In this regard, we agree with the ruling of
the lower Court on the issue of ownership.  It stated -</blockquote>

<blockquote>The ownership of the defendants over the property in question has
been satisfactorily shown to the Court by the evidence adduced by them.  The Answer of the late Feliciano Carreon
filed in Cadastral Case No. N-25, over the lot in question (Exhs. "6"
and "6-A") shows that he had acquired ownership over the land in
question by "occupation and cultivation in concept of owner after the
death of my brother Pantaleon Carreon".  In other words, the late Feliciano Carreon derived his rights over the
property from his brother, Pantaleon Carreon.  But Pantaleon Carreon had transferred his rights over the property to
Antonio Maguinsawan, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>shown by
Exhs. "4" and "4-A", way back on September 1, 1936.  So, when Feliciano Carreon claimed this lot
by filing his Answer in 1959 in Cadastral Case No. N-25, LRC Cad. Rec. No.
N-191, he had no right over the same because he could not have acquired the
rights of Pantaleon Carreon who had already transferred his rights to Antonio
Maguinsawan.  After the death of Antonio
Maguinsawan, the herein property passed to the defendants herein as heirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The ownership of the defendants over the lot in question is also
shown by Exhibits "7", "7-A", "8" and
"8-A", which are the Survey Notification Cards of Feliciano Carreon
over Lot 2642 which is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">adjoining to the
lot in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">question, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and Survey Notification Cards of the Heirs of
Paterno Catipunan for Lot No. 2644, another adjoining lot of the lot in
question.  From these exhibits, it is
shown that Lot No. 2642 is in the name of the <u>Heirs of Antonio Maguinsawan</u>.  All these documentary evidence strongly and
clearly show that Lot No. 2642 really belongs to the defendants herein as Heirs
of Antonio Maguinsawan.  There can also
be no doubt as to the ownership of the herein defendants over the lot in
question as the same has been confirmed by the Decision in GR-No. L-28332 of
the Supreme Court (CA-GR No. 32974-R).  Although the plaintiffs cannot be bound by this Decision because they
are not parties to the case, yet this is an additional showing that the
defendants herein are the owners of the property in question."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the issue that the
trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the counterclaim because of
failure to pay docket fees, suffice it to say that the counterclaim for
reconveyance is necessarily connected with the subject matter of the complaint,
so that it is a compulsory counterclaim.  Under the rules then in force there is no need to pay docketing fees for
a compulsory counterclaim.  Moreover,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the third and fifth assigned
errors the findings of the lower court that Exhibits "1-A" and
"1-C" are fictitious</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and were issued without due process is
predicated on the testimony of Atty. Lobasano, the clerk of court, that the
records did not contain the original of the alleged orders, Exhibits
"1-A" and "1-C".  Thus, the trial court made the following disquisition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing documentary exhibits, the Court is
convinced that the issuance of the Decree of registration covering the lot in
question and which resulted to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">issuance
of </span>Original Certificate of Title No. 0-2496 in the name of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Feliciano </span>Carreon, and which was also
subsequently transferred to his heirs, the Plaintiffs herein, under Transfer
Certificate of Title No.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>T-14292,
was procured through fraud.  The Orders
of Municipal Judge Numeriano Napoles (Exhs. '1-A' and ‘1-C') which were the
basis <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the issuance of the
decree of registration, were indeed fictitious for no originals of the same
were found in the records of Cadastral Case No. N-25, LRC Cad. Rec. No. N-191,
wherein the lot in question is involved.  If these Orders were really genuine, there would be no reason why the
originals could not be found in the records of said case.  The evidence is bereft of any showing that
the cadastral record was tampered as to warrant a conclusion that the originals
of Exhibits "1-A" and "1-C" were lost or destroyed.  As a matter of fact, a long decision of
Municipal Judge Napoles (Exh. "9") adjudicating non-contested lots
still exists.  Since the record shows
that there is an Order of Judge Numeriano Napoles adjudicating non-contested
lots, dated August 16, 1960, there would be no reason that said Municipal Judge
would still issue a separate Order (Exh. "1-C") adjudicating Lot No.
2642 to Feliciano Carreon.  Considering
that the said Order is dated August 16, 1960, the same could have been included
in that long Order of the said Judge (Exh. "9").  This is an indication or a showing that
Exhibit ‘1-C’ is fictitious and that no original of the same had even
existed.  Aside from this, since the
records also of the Cadastral Case shows that Lot No. 2642 is still pending
hearing, there is more reason for us to believe that the Order adjudicating Lot
2642 (Exh. "1-C") is not genuine.  Hence, it can be concluded that the decree of registration of the lot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>question was obtained through
fraud.  Even assuming that the alleged
Order adjudicating the lot in question is a genuine one, yet the same can be
assailed for want of due process as the other claimants of the lot in question,
namely, Paciencia Lim Serrano and defendant Hermila Cartagena, were deprived of
their day in court.  They were not given
an opportunity to adduce their evidence over the lot in question.  As a matter of fact, they still believe,
that, up to the present, no hearing has yet been conducted.  The alleged order being issued without due
process, the same is, therefore, null and void."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">These survey

<p class="BODY">Under the sixth assignment of error it is argued that respondents
failed to show any right of possession to warrant registration of the
questioned lot under Act No. 496.  We

that said lot was acquired by Antonio Maguinsawan on September 1, 1936.  He is the father in law of respondent
Hermila Cartagena and grandfather of respondent Salvacion Maguinawan Lunay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 2889, filed by respondents, is an action for
recovery of possession as owners of said property.  The Supreme Court ruled in their favor in G.R. No. L-28332.  While this case was pending respondents and
Feliciano Carreon and Paciencia Lim Serrano filed answers in Cadastral Case No.
N-25.  As above adverted to, in the
survey notification cards prepared by Feliciano Carreon for Lot No. 2641, he acknowledged
that Lot No. 2642, which is the now disputed lot, belongs to the heirs of
Antonio Maguinsawan, respondents herein.  In his answer, he traced the ownership of his brother Pantaleon Carreon
of Lot 2642 who sold the same to Antonio Maguinsawan.  Petitioners therefore, cannot lawfully stake any claim to the
same as heirs of Feliciano Carreon whose right is derived only from Pantaleon
