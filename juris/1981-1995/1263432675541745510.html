<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon arraignment, the
appellant pleaded not guilty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court
summarized the prosecution’s evidence as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x x x [D]uring the hearing the prosecution presented witnesses
Emilia Rosaldez, Pat. George Baculinao, Pat. Ernesto Ancayan and Pat. Luisito
Silvano.  They alleged that on May 6,
1989 a team of policemen conducted a buy bust operation against one alias
Pandong who had been the subject of numerous complaints from concerned
residents, for drug pushing.  The team
directed by Capt. Gaudencio Cordora, the ISOG and Narcotics Unit Chief of the Pasay
City Police Station, was formed after surveillance (sic) alias Pandong was
identified with the help of a Confidential Informant (CI).  The team was composed of Pat. Ancayan, who
acted as poseur buyer with Pat. Baculinao, Pat. Silvano, Pat. Taytay and others
(sic) were back-ups and perimeter guards.  They proceeded to the vicinity of Leveriza near the corner of Fresno
St., in Pasay City at around 1 pm.  There, Pat. Ancayan, saw the suspect who was identified later as
Fernando Santiago standing alone infront of his house near the door.  He then approached the suspect and told him
that he will buy shabu worth P150.00.  The accused responded and he immediately left and went inside the house
and after a while he returned.  Pat
Ancayan then handed to the accused the buy bust money consisting of 1 pc/P100
and 1 pc. 50 peso bills.  After he
received the money, the accused handed to Pat. Ancayan an aluminum foil and
seeing that it contained the shabu, Pat. Ancayan immediately took hold of the
accused.  At that instance Pat.
Baculinao who was just a few meters away rushed to the accused helped (sic) in
placing under control.  He then searched
the accused and recovered the buy bust money from his left front pant
pocket.  Also recovered from the accused
in his wallet was a small T-bag of suspected dried marijuana leaves, and 20
live M-16 Armalite Rifle bullets placed in a box was (sic) recovered in the
house on top of a table (TSN., June 5/89).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The suspected shabu (Exh. F-1) and marijuana leaves (Exh. E-1) were
taken to the office of the NBI for laboratory analysis, and Emilia Rosaldez the
Forensic Chemist who conducted the examination certified, after the usual
qualitative chemical, physical and chromatographic or confirmation states that
the suspected shabu was positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated
drug and the dried leaves positive for marijuana (TSN., June 5/89; Exh. D. C.)”
(Rollo, p. 6)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant countered
the prosecution’s version of the incident of May 6, 1989 by presenting his own
version, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x x x That between the hours of 1 and 1:30 p. m., on May 6, 1989
two (2) policemen whom he identified as Patrolmen Bruno and Baculinao picked
him from his house and brought him to the Pasay City Police Station.  That in the house before the policemen came
a certain Boy Morris whom he had known for 2 weeks and talked to him (accused);
that he was then resting having just been sick of flu and told to come down;
that he refused and it was when (sic) the policemen came up the house; they
searched first the place, then they find (sic) nothing they asked him to bring
out shabu and when he could not produce anything as there was none in the house
they hit him on the chest with fist blow.  He denied that he was keeping and selling shabu; that the ammunitions
recovered in his house belonged to Reynaldo Disposado, a member of the military
(navy) who has stayed with him; that at the police headquarters a policeman
showed him shabu and marijuana; that he was being made to sign a document and
when he refused that (sic) he denied having sold shabu to Pat. Ancayan and
having received P150.00 from him (TSN., Aug. 2/89).” (Rollo, pp. 6-7)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After joint trial of the three (3) cases, the Regional Trial
Court of Pasay City, Branch 115 found the appellant guilty as charged in
Criminal Case No. 89-2516.  He was, however,
acquitted in the two (2) other cases.  The dispositive portion of the joint decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>“All the premises considered, judgment is rendered finding the
accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of selling or delivering to
another, Japanese synthetic cocaine or shabu, a regulated drug, defined and
penalized under Section 15, Republic Act 6425, as amended, and sentences him to
suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay the fine of P20,000.00 with
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and the cost of this proceedings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For insufficiency of the evidence the charges of illegal possession
of 20 rounds of M-16 live bullets and of illegal possession of dried marijuana
leaves in small quantity are ordered dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The subject shabu and dried marijuana leaves and the live M-16
bullets are confiscated and forfeited and the Branch Clerk is directed to turn
them to the Dangerous Drugs Board/Firearms and Explosive Unit for disposition.”
(Rollo, p. 8)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant now
contends:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN
NOT HOLDING THAT THE PROSECUTION MISERABLY FAILED TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE
ACCUSED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THE
ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY AS CHARGED, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN
SENTENCING HIM TO UNDERGO SUBSIDIARY IMPRISONMENT IN CASE OF INSOLVENCY.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As in most criminal cases
of the same nature, the main issue raised hinges on credibility of witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant submits
that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are inconsistent, contradictory,
doubtful, incredible and not sufficient to sustain conviction.  He specifically mentions the testimonies of
Pat. George Baculinao and Pat. Silvano.  According to him, the testimonies of the two police officers were
presented to corroborate the testimony of Patrolman Ancayan and to establish
the veracity of the buy bust operation.  However, the two (2) officers testified that they did not actually see
the sale of the shabu between the poseur-buyer who was Patrolman Ancayan and
the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The well-entrenched
principle is that the commission of the crime of illegal sale of a prohibited
drug is considered consummated once the sale transaction is established.  (People v. Macuto, 176 SCRA 762 [1989];
People v. Dekingco, 189 SCRA 512 [1990]; People v. Enrique, Jr., G. R. No.
90738, December 8, 1991) In the instant case, </span>Patrolman Ancayan, the <span style="">poseur-buyer testified </span>as regards the
sale <span style="">transaction of shabu between him
and </span>the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Patrolman </span>Ancayan
categorically stated <span style="">that after
conducting </span>a surveillance wherein the <span style="">identity of the accused as a </span>drug pusher was established, <span style="">he, together with Cpl. </span>Racquion, Pat.
Silvano, Pat. <span style="">Baculinao and Pat. Monsod
</span>conducted a buy bust operation.  <span style="">He acted as the poseur-buyer </span>while the
other members <span style="">of the operation </span>positioned
themselves not far <span style="">from the appellant’s
</span>residence.  Pat. Ancayan, then <span style="">proceeded to the </span>residence of the
appellant and saw <span style="">the latter standing
in front of </span>his residence.  He <span style="">then approached the appellant </span>and told
him that he wanted <span style="">to buy shabu in </span>the
amount of P150.00.  The appellant <span style="">then went </span>inside his house and after
more or less five (5) <span style="">minutes, </span>the
appellant came out.  After giving <span style="">the appellant the </span>buy bust money the
appellant <span style="">handed him an </span>aluminum
foil containing the shabu.  The <span style="">money and the shabu </span>were identified in
court by Pat. Ancayan.</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts, alone, unequivocally <span style="">prove the consummation </span>of the crime of illegal sale <span style="">of prohibited drug.  We ruled </span>in <u><span style="">Peo</span>p</u><u><span style="">le</span></u><span style=""> <u>v.</u> <u>Fabian</u> G</span><span style="">.R.
No. 83329, December 10, </span>1991, citing <u><span style="">People</span></u> <u><span style="">v</span>.</u>
<u><span style="">de</span></u><span style=""> <u>la</u></span> <u><span style="">Cruz</span></u><span style=""> (191 SCRA 160 [1990]) </span>“that w<span style="">hen a police officer went through the motions
of </span>buying prohibited drugs and <span style="">his
offer to buy was accepted by the accused-seller, the crime was consummated by </span>mere
delivery of <span style="">the drug purchased”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the fact that Pat. George Baculinao and Pat. Silvano were
not close enough to witness the sale transaction between the appellant and Pat.
Ancayan is immaterial.  Moreover, these
police officers had satisfactorily explained why they did not witness the sale
transaction.  Thus, Patrolman Baculinao
testified that he did not see the appellant delivering the aluminum foil
containing shabu since he was about five (5) meters away from the appellant
while Pat. Silvano was about fifty (50) meters away from the appellant and Pat.
Ancayan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant’s theory that “it is unlikely and hard to believe
that the appellant, if indeed a pusher, would readily sell shabu to a buyer he
does not know” deserves scant consideration.  We have consistently ruled in the past that “retail drug pushers sell
their prohibited wares to customers, be, they strangers or not, in private as
well as in public places.” (People v. Fabian <u>supra</u> citing People v.
Sanchez, 173 SCRA 305 [1989]; People v. Paco, 170 SCRA 681 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the fact that the police team which conducted the buy
bust operation did not personally know the identity of the appellant at the
time of the sale transaction and the appellant questions the veracity of the
operation against him does not erode the credibility of the team.  What matters is the fact that the appellant
sold and delivered shabu, a prohibited drug to Patrolman Ancayan who acted as
poseur buyer.  The prosecution witnesses
are police officers and are presumed to have regularly performed their duties
in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  (People v. Mariano, 191 SCRA 136 [1990]; People v. Catan, G.R. No.
92928, January 21, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty imposed by the trial court is reclusion
perpetua.  This should be life
imprisonment.  Applying, therefore, the
rule that when the penalty imposed is higher than prision coreccional no
subsidiary imprisonment shall be imposed upon the culprit (Article 39 (3)
Revised Penal Code; People v. Andiza, 164 SCRA 642 [1988]; People v. Bati, 189
SCRA 97 [1990]) we agree with the appellant that the trial court committed an
error in sentencing him to undergo subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction appealed from is
AFFIRMED.  The penalty imposed should,
however, be <u>life</u> <u><span style="">imprisonment</span></u><span style=""> </span>instead of reclusion perpetua and it
is further ordered that there shall be no subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency.  Costs against the
appellant.</p>
