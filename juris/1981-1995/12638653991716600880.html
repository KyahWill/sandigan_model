<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="9">22 September 1982</st1:date>,
herein private respondent <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Sanchez, claiming
to be the registered owner of a parcel of land with an area of 794 square
meters situated in <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>, General <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
under TCT No. T-112547 of the <span style="">land
records of the province of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, filed a complaint
with the Municipal Trial Court </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">General <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, docketed therein as Civil Case No. 329, to
oust herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>
from the said land on the ground that he (<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>)
needed the same for the use of his married son who had no place of his
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant </span>(<span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span>) <span style="">denied the
allegations of the complaint and claimed that the house occupied by her, as
well as the lot </span>on <span style="">which it was
constructed, belonged to her mother, which, the latter inherited from her
deceased parents, <span class="SpellE">Clemencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>

<p class="BODY">After trial, <span style="">or </span>on
<st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="9">24 September 1984</st1:date>, judgment
was rendered by the municipal court, ordering the defendant <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span>) to
immediately surrender possession of the disputed property to the plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendant was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">further ordered to pay the plaintiff the

and P200.00, for attorney’s fees.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the municipal
court found that the parcel of land in question was covered by a certificate of
title duly issued in the name of the plaintiff, and the ownership and title of
the <span style="">plaintiff to the said property was
confirmed by one Modesto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> who testified that </span>the
<span style="">said land was sold to him by his
mother, <span class="SpellE">Clemencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> and
he, in turn, sold a part thereof to the plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
Sanchez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal court further
found that the defendant had not presented any evidence to rebut and overcome
the validity of the plaintiff's title to the said property.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant (<span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span>) did not appeal
from the said municipal court judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, on <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="10">31 October 1984</st1:date>,
the said <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>,
together with Antonio <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> y <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>

and daughter, respectively, of <span style="">the late
spouses <span class="SpellE">Clemencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> and
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, filed a complaint against Modesto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Sanchez with
th</span>e Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, docketed
therein as Civil <span style="">Case No. TM-69, for the
annulment of the certificates of title covering the lot in question, which were
allegedly issued fraudulently in the respective names of the said Modesto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Sanchez and
for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the lot to them (plaintiffs
in the case).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="12">10
 December 1984</st1:date>, the Municipal Trial Court of General <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
issued a writ of execution in Civil Case No. 329.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>, however,
refused to <span style="">vacate the land so that soon
thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Sanchez (as plaintiff) filed a
motion for the issuance of an order for the demolition of the house of <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span> (as
defendant).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the
plaintiffs in Civil Case No. TM-69 before the </span><span style="">RTC </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> amended their complaint to include the judge of the
Municipal Trial Court of Gen. <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, as party defendant, claiming that the motion for
the demolition of the house occupied by <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>, i</span>f granted and enforced by said municipal
court, would cause irreparable damage and injury to said co-plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, plaintiffs in Civil Case No.
TM-69 prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain
the said municipal court from ordering the demolition of the house of <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>The defendants in Civil Case No. TM-69

same with the court, hence, the RTC of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
acquired no jurisdiction over the case (Civil Case No. TM-69).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of the defendants in Civil Case No. TM-69 (who are
herein private respondents), a preliminary hearing was conducted on their
affirmative defenses and on 24 November 1986, the trial court dismissed the
complaint on the grounds that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
complaint was filed without a previous confrontation before <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">Lupon</span> of

the said defendant Modesto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, and yet, no earnest
efforts had been exerted by the plaintiffs towards a compromise agreement with
the defendants, in accordance with the provisions of Article 222 of the Civil
Code.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue for resolution is whether or not the
respondent Court of Appeals committed a reversible error in ruling that the
remedy of the petitioners was <span style="">appeal
(not <i>certiorari</i>) from the decision rendered in Civil Case </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">329 of the Municipal Trial Court </span>of G<span style="">eneral <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cavite</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, and the order of dismissal in Civil Case
No. TM-69 of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, errors of judgment or of procedure, not relating to
the court's jurisdiction nor involving grave abuse of discretion, are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by <i>certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>The Court has repeatedly held that <i>certiorari</i>
is not the remedy <span style="">when appeal is
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there are exceptions
to the rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, <i>certiorari</i>
is justified where the trial judge capriciously and whimsically exercises his
judgment,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or where an appeal is not adequate to
protect one's rights or where there may be danger of failure of justice,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and in order to prevent irreparable damage
and injury to a party.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <i>Certiorari</i> may be availed of where an
appeal would be slow, inadequate, insufficient, and will not promptly relieve a
party from the injurious effects of the judgment complained of, or in order to
avoid further litigation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, while an appeal from the decision in Civil
Case No. 329 of the Municipal Trial Court of General <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> was available to the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>, such remedy was
not adequate in the light of her answer that the house and land occupied by her
and <span style="">from where she was sought to be
ejected, belonged to her deceased mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In actions of forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, the
main issue is possession <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>, independently of any claim of
ownership or possession <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> that
either party may set forth in his pleadings;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and an appeal does not operate to change the
nature of the original action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
appeal, in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, it is within the
discretion of the court to look into the evidence supporting the </span>assigned
errors relating to the alleged ownership of <span style="">appellant insofar as said evidence would indicate or determine the
nature of appellant's possession of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court should not however
resolve the issues raised by such assigned errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>resolution of said issues would
effect an adjudication on <span style="">ownership
which is not sanctioned in the summary action for </span>unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, an appeal by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span> from the judgment of the municipal court in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceedings (Civil Case No. 329) would have
affected only the material possession of the land disputed by the <span style="">parties, but would not resolve the issue of
ownership put forth by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> <span class="SpellE">Presco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
filing of an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to resolve the
issue of ownership was proper, and this was done by her in Civil Case No. TM-69
before the RTC of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cavite</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appeal from the dismissal order of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> in Civil Case No. TM-69, while also available to the
herein petitioners, since the dismissal of their amended complaint was a final
order, was nonetheless inadequate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that the private respondent <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Sanchez
had, in the meantime, asked the Municipal Trial Court of General <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to issue an order for the demolition of the house of <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span>

<p class="BODY">An appeal, then, from the Regional Trial Court's order dismissing

the injurious effects of an order of demolition issued in Civil Case No. 329 by
the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a danger

<p class="BODY">Besides, the reasons for the dismissal of the amended complaint
in Civil Case No. TM-69 were patently erroneous as to amount to grave abuse of

(petitioners herein) towards a compromise settlement with the defendants
(private respondents herein) <span style="">pursuant
