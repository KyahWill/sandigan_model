<p class="BODY">The present case involves two decisions of the Collector of
Customs of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City on a seizure case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1988</st1:date>, ordering the release of 9,000
bags of sugar belonging to petitioner Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Yaokasin</span>
which were seized by the Philippine Coast Guard and turned over to the custody
of customs authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second,
rendered on <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1988</st1:date>
reverses the first decision and orders the forfeiture of the sugar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did not appeal the June 7 -
decision and the Collector of Customs rendered the second decision predicated
on the automatic review powers of the Commissioner in decisions adverse to the
government, as embodied in Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20-87.</p>

<p class="BODY">The memorandum was issued by then Acting Commissioner of Customs
Alexander Padilla on <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1987</st1:date>,
and provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"CUSTOMS
MEMORANDUM ORDER</blockquote>

<blockquote>NO. <u>20-87<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>TO:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All Collectors of Customs and Others Concerned</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Effective immediately, you are hereby directed to implement
strictly the following -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in">'Decisions of the Collector of Customs in
seizure and protest cases are subject to review by the Commissioner upon appeal
as provided under existing laws; <u>provided, however, that </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">where </span>a decision of the Collector of
Customs in such seizure and </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">protest
cases is </span>adverse to the government, it shall automatically be reviewed</u>
by the Commissioner of Customs.'</p>

<blockquote>"In view thereof, no releases in any seizure or like cases may
be effected unless and until the decision of the Collector has been confirmed
in writing by the Commissioner of Customs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"For immediate and strict compliance.</span></blockquote>

(Emphasis Ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner disputes the validity of the memorandum, claiming
instead that the law applicable to his case is Sec. 2313 of the Tariff and
Customs Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of 1982.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not the Commissioner of
Customs has the power of automatic review over decisions of the Collector of <span class="GramE">Customs in seizure and protest cases.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority upholds the automatic review power, based on CMO No.
20-87.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I disagree, based on the

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case are similar to that involved in <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Man v. Jacinto (93 Phil. 1093), briefly stated below:</p>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1951" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1951</st1:date>,
the Manila Port Collector of Customs ordered the seizure of the shipments of
textile and a number of sewing machines, consigned to <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Sy</span></st1:city> <st1:state>Man.</st1:state></st1:place><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1951" day="4" month="6">June
 4, 1951</st1:date>, he ordered the release of the articles covered by the
seizure order, upon payment of the corresponding customs duties, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">except the sewing machines which were
declared forfeited to be sold, if saleable or otherwise, destroyed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1951" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1951</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Man received a copy of the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Man's counsel
sought execution of the decision, based on the fact that the Commissioner of
Customs could no longer review the decision after the lapse of 15 days from
notification of said decision to <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Sy</span></st1:city>
 <st1:state>Man.</st1:state></st1:place></blockquote>

<blockquote>The issue centered on the power of automatic review of the
Commissioner of Customs, based on his power and supervision and control over
the Collector of Customs, allegedly implemented by way of the Memorandum
promulgated by the Insular Collector of Customs, dated August 18, 1947, which
provides that as in protest cases, decisions of the Collector of Customs in
seizure cases, whether appealed or not, are subject to review by the Insular
Collector (now Commissioner).</blockquote>

<blockquote>We ruled that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) Since the Memorandum Order dated <st1:date year="1947" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1947</st1:date> was never approved by the department head
and was never published in the Official Gazette, as required by Sec. 551 of the
Revised Administrative Code, the same cannot be given legal effect;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Additionally, the Memorandum is adjudged inconsistent with law,
since there is no law giving the Commissioner the power to review and revise <span class="SpellE">unappealed</span> decision of the Collector of Customs in seizure
cases;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) Under the law then in force, governing the Bureau of Customs,
the decisions of the Collector of Customs in a seizure case, if not protested
and appealed by the importer to the Commissioner of Customs on time becomes
final, not only to him, but also against the Government as well, and neither
the Commissioner nor the Department Head has the power to review, revise or
modify such <span class="SpellE">unappealed</span> decision.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, it is claimed that CMO No. 20-87 merely

1, Section 2313 of RA 1937 (Tariff and Customs Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
already governed the review powers of the Commissioner of Customs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while both Section 12 of the Plan and
2313 of the Tariff and Customs Code deal with the review powers of the
Commissioner of Customs, the Plan is a general law, as it concerns itself with
the reorganization of the executive branch of the government in a martial law
regime, whereas the Code is a special law, i.e., specifically on tariff and
customs duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Plan
is subservient to the Code and the automatic review power granted therein can
not be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to subsequent amendments, Section 2313 of the Code provided

a <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span> may be undertaken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of a period was "decidedly
unsatisfactory and even unjust, if not oppressive" to the importer, who
was willing "to abide by the decision of the Collector, to pay the amounts

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Man case, <span class="GramE">We</span>
noted two defects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first pertained
to the absence of the period found in Sec. 2315, while the second referred to a
need for a provision on review and revision by the Commissioner of Customs on <span class="SpellE"><u>unappealed</u></span><u> seizure cases</u>, as governed by Sec.

Legislature may be requested to insert a section in the Revised Administrative
Code similar to Section 1393 (now Section of the Customs Law) which applies to <span class="SpellE">unprotested</span> cases of assessment duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defect in said section however is that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">it </span>does not fix the period within
which the automatic review and revision or <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span>
to be ordered by the Commissioner and the Secretary of Finance must be <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This defect
should be remedied." (p. 1107)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, as can be seen, our legislators merely acted on
the defect found in Sec. 2315 by providing for a period in cases of assessment
of duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, they invested
the Commissioner with automatic review powers where an assessment was adverse
to the government, thus, eliminating any possible prejudice to the
government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">did </span>not, however, provide any authority for automatic review in <span class="SpellE">unappealed</span> seizure cases, similar to that found in Sec.
2313, thus belying any intent to implement the Plan with respect to the automatic
review powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Man case, it is now argued
that the lack of automatic review<b> </b>causes prejudice to the
government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">We </span>quote from <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Man:</p>

<blockquote>"It is argued that if this power of review and revision by the
Commissioner of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">unappealed</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> seizure cases</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>is not conceded, then in cases where
the Collector in his decision commits a blunder prejudicial to the interests of
the Government, or renders a decision through fraud or in collusion with the
importer, the Government cannot protect itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The argument is not without merit; but we must bear in mind that the law
is promulgated to operate on ordinary, common, routine cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule is and the law presumes that in
seizure cases Collectors of Customs act honestly and correctly and as
Government officials, always with an eye to the protection of the interests of
the Government employing them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
mistakes are committed at all more often than not they are in favor of the
Government and not against it, and that is the reason <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">why when the importer feels aggrieved by
their decision, he is given every chance and facility to protest the decision
and appeal to the Commissioner</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Cases of erroneous decisions against
the interest of the Government of decisions rendered in collusion and
connivance with importers <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">are the
exception</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>To protect the Government in such
exceptional cases</u>, </span>we find that in every seizure case, section 1378
(now Section 2302, Customs Law) of the Revised Administrative Code requires the
Collector to immediately notify the Commissioner and the Auditor General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be that this requirement has for its
main purpose the recording of and <span class="GramE">accounting for the articles
seized so that in case of confiscation the Commissioner and the Auditor General
will know what articles have</span> become government property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">But
the notice will also inform the Commissioner and the Auditor General of the
seizure</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>If the seizure is important or
unusual, the Commissioner may, if he so desires, order the Collector as his
subordinate to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">withhold action on
the seizure, or hold in abeyance, within a reasonable time, the promulgation of
his decision</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>until
after he had conferred with the Commissioner or the latter had studied the case
and given suggestions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that stage of
the proceedings <u>before</u> definite action is taken by the Collector, and <u>a
decision rendered</u> by him, it would seem that any action by him as a
subordinate is still subject to the supervisory authority and control of the
Commissioner as his chief, and the latter may still influence and direct the
Collector's action if he finds occasion for doing so." (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We believe that for as long as the procedure laid down in Sec.
2302 is observed, there can be no resulting prejudice to the government in <span class="SpellE">unappealed</span> seizure cases, since the Commissioner in the
exercise of his supervisory authority can ask the Collector to "withhold
action on the seizure or hold in abeyance within a reasonable time the
promulgation of a decision, until after he has conferred with the
Collector," in cases of unusual or important seizure.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it now stands therefore, there is no law allowing automatic
review in seizure cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, CMO No. 20-87, issued supposedly in implementation of Sec. 12 of the
Plan/P.D. No. 1, which has since been amended/modified, is void and of no effect,
being inconsistent with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming applicability of P.D. No. 1/Plan, CMO No. 20-87 would
still not be effective since it was not published as required by Section 551 of
the Revised Administrative Code (the law then in force since the 1987 Revised
Administrative Code took effect on September 21, 1988), which in part provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">CAO No. 226 deals, among others, with "protests and
appeals," and implements Section 2313 of the Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Par. VII thereof similarly gives the

<p class="BODY">In contrast, CMO No. 20-87 <u>enlarges</u> the power of the
Commissioner of Customs by investing him with automatic powers in seizure
cases, in effect amending COA No. 226.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

</span>Absent such publication, the same cannot be upheld for non­-compliance
with Sec. 551 of the Revised Administrative Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">For these reasons, I vote to GRANT the petition.</p>
