<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence upon which the Trial Court based its

follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At or about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of January 27,
1986, Evelyn Cantina was already dismissed from her classes at the <span class="SpellE">Abellana</span> National High School, located at Jones Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From
there, her classmates, Priscilla <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span> <span class="SpellE">Bringuila</span>, accompanied
her in walking towards Colon Street, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, to
buy some medicine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not long after, a
passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> plying the Guadalupe-Carbon market
route stopped by the side of the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The driver, <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span>,
invited the three girls to board his <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As Colon Street is very near, Evelyn Cantina
declined the invitation at first.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> was however, insistent in giving the three girls a
lift.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the latter accepted the
invitation by taking the front seat, with Evelyn sitting right beside <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>driver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time however, <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>
Rodriguez and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumalinog</span>
were already seated at the passengers' area at the back (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pp. 18-21, April 24, 1986, Priscilla <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon reaching the corner of Jones Avenue and Colon Street,
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven by <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span>
stopped at the red traffic light.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Bringuila</span> and <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span>
disembarked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evelyn was also about to
alight but she was prevented by <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> who threatened
to raise her skirt if she insists on alighting and following her two companions
<span class="SpellE">Bringuila</span> and <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span> tried
to help Evelyn by pulling her out but meanwhile, the green light turned on and
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> sped off towards Juan Luna Street (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 17-26, April 24, 1986, Priscilla <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span>).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"Reaching Juan Luna, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
then made a U-turn on its return trip to Guadalupe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mean­while, <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>
Rodriguez transferred to the front seat beside Evelyn (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">p. </span>20, August 6, 1986, Evelyn
Cantina).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Anticipating that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driven by <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> would make a return trip to
Guadalupe, <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bringuila</span>
posted themselves beside the corner of Colon and Juan Luna Streets near the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Savings Bank, where vehicles would stop at the
red light signal (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 34, April 24, 1986,
Priscilla <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, on its way to Guadalupe, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driven by <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> stopped at the corner of Colon and
Juan Luna Streets when the red light signaled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Evelyn attempted to go down from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
but, she was prevented by <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span> Rodriguez who placed
his leg as barricade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Realizing that
Evelyn <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">was </span>being prevented from
disembarking, <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bringuila</span>
who stood by the roadside, close to the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
attempted to pull Evelyn from the vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, they did not succeed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> again sped off and headed
towards Jones Avenue when the green light turned on (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 22, August 6, 1986, Evelyn Cantina).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the way to the Capitol and upon reaching the <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Police Station, the
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> turned left along B. Rodriguez Street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When it was already near the Southern Medical
Center, <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span> Rodriguez and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sumalinog</span> got off from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
leaving <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">only </span><span class="SpellE">Alburo</span>
and Evelyn on board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alburo</span>
then drove off, turning right at V. <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Avenue,
passing thru <span class="SpellE">Englis</span>, <span class="GramE">the</span>
place where Evelyn resides.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter
then begged <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> that she <span class="GramE">be</span>
allowed to disembark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> did not heed Evelyn's plea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he pulled a knife and threatened to
slash her side if she would disembark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> then proceeded to Beverly Hills (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 27-30, August 16, 1986, Evelyn Cantina).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thinking that Evelyn might have been dropped by <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> at her residence in <span class="SpellE">Englis</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Atillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bringuila</span>
boarded another jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were hoping
that Evelyn was already home and that they could get the notebook which one of
them left with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, only
Evelyn's mother was there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They then
realized that Evelyn was really in trouble and so they related to her mother
what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alarmed by such information,
the latter sought the help of Ester <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>, a neighbor
and close friend (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 5-10, May 13, 1986,
Priscilla <span class="SpellE">Atillo</span>).</blockquote>

downtown, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, called up by phone Evelyn's
father, who came home not long after (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 26,
May 13, 1986, Ester <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Together, they then formed search teams to
look for Evelyn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lourdes Cantina and
Ester <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> went as search team No. 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Riding on a taxi, they searched the
reclamation area and made inquiries from the motels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Evelyn's father as well as
her <span class="GramE">uncle,</span> rode on two separate <span class="SpellE">motortcycles</span>,
making <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">up </span>search teams 2 and 3,
and scoured the streets of the city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the search proved futile (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp.
29-32, May 13, 1986, Ester <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

OPPRA (Capitol Hills), <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> stopped the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Holding the
knife, he went down from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and
threateningly came close to Evelyn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
then pointed the knife at her and told her that something would happen to her
if she would shout.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he pushed
Evelyn's head against the steering wheel which rendered the latter unconscious.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">"When </span>Evelyn
regained her senses she found herself without her panty anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Blood was on her vagina and she felt pain on
her stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> with his face close to hers, getting up from
her then raising his pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cried
and asked <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> what he had done to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not answer her inquiries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he made her walk for a while,
outside of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, accordingly to ease the pain
she felt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he made her sit back on
the front seat with him, still under threat of death (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pp. 11-19, August 15, 1986, Evelyn Cantina).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;

drove back to the City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still under
threat of death, Evelyn remained seated beside him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To make it appear that nothing really
happened, <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> even picked up some passengers along
the way (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 33, August 15, 1986, Evelyn
Cantina).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Ester were standing near Power Foods Restaurant at Jones Avenue, Ester spotted
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> coming from the Capitol heading towards
downtown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ester signaled the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to stop.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As

from the vehicle upon order from her mother Lourdes Cantina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As she was embraced by Ester, she whispered
to Ester that <span class="SpellE">Alburo</span> should not be allowed to abscond
because he had raped her (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 42-43, May 13,

passengers at the back area disembarked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ester and Evelyn then sat down at the passenger's area with a certain <span class="SpellE">Boyet</span> <span class="SpellE">Junio</span>, a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanod</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 48, May 13, 1986, Ester <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

refused claiming that nothing wrong had happened between him and Evelyn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Ester told him he had nothing to be
afraid of if he was telling the truth he however, relented and drove the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> towards <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 43-45, August

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">After evaluation </span>of
the evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in its </span>totality, we
are not persuaded by the theory that Appellant and Evelyn were
sweethearts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If they were, surely,
Evelyn would not have jeopardized their relationship by accusing him of having deflowered
her and, on top of it all, filing a criminal charge against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evelyn's picture, allegedly given to
Appellant as a remembrance of their romantic relationship, was actually given
to <span class="SpellE">Ruel</span> <span class="SpellE">Sipi</span>, her former
boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She emphatically denies having
given Appellant any such token.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither
was Appellant able to present any convincing evidence to substantiate his claim
like love letters, notes and other symbols of affection.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Moreover, </span>if, in
fact, they had been lovers, Evelyn would have boarded Appellant's jeep
voluntarily and alone <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">unaccompanied </span>by
her two classmates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the latter had
any inkling that Evelyn did want to go with Appellant, they would not have
shown <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">so </span>much concern for her
welfare and safety like following the passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driven by Appellant to the traffic lights, trying to pull Evelyn down from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, failing in which, they eventually reported the
incident to Evelyn's mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's argument that Evelyn charged him with the crime out
of fear of her parents who did not approve of their relationships <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>unconvincing because, if it had been
so, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Evelyn </span>could have easily told
her mother after <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">the </span>latter had
successfully traced their whereabouts that nothing untoward had happened
between her and Appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her normal
reaction would have been to cover-up for the man <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">she loved and had had a clandestine affair with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, on the contrary, Evelyn lost no time in
denouncing Appellant and exposing to her family and the authorities the
disgrace that had befallen her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's other assigned errors focus on the issue of
credibility of witnesses in respect of which it is well settled that Appellate
Courts will not generally disturb the factual findings of Trial Courts which
are in a better position to weigh the conflicting testimonies, having heard the
witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the trial unless it is found <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that
the Trial Courts have plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value
that, if considered, might affect the result </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the case (People </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">vs. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Cruz, Sr., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-71462,

<p class="BODY">In reviewing the evidence adduced by the prosecution for this
crime of Rape, we have likewise been guided by three well-known principles,
namely, (1) that an accusation of rape can be made with facility, is difficult
to prove, but more difficult <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>the
person accused, though innocent,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> to
disprove; (2) that in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where
only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be
scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) that the evidence for the prosecution
must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength
from the weaknesses of the evidence for the defense (Reyes, Revised Penal code,
Book II, 1981 ed., p. 850).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The factual milieu of this criminal charge before us gives us no
reason to depart from these established rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, we find that Appellant had taken Evelyn away against
her will, with lewd designs, subsequently forced her to submit to his lust and
rendering her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">unconscious in the
process, thereby justifying his conviction for the complex crime of Forcible
Abduction with Rape under Article 48 in relation to Articles </span>335 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>342 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of the Revised Penal Code, with which he has herein been charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
