the decision of this Court, dated 25 April 1988, filed by Juan F. Gomez, Jesus
T. David, <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> children and their father Antonio
V. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> (as alleged heirs of <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>

(as alleged heirs of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>); the motion for <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span>
order of Juan F. Gomez; and omnibus motion for early reso­lution and immediate
release of funds, filed by the <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court will resolve the motions
separately.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left;" align="left">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration of Juan F.
Gomez</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Movant's</span> claims are for attorney's fees
equivalent to 12% of one-third (1/3) of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> and P30,000.00 representing transportation and
representation expenses, for services admittedly rendered to the heirs of Don
Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These claims may not <span style="">be </span>properly
charged against the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in <span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">Gabin</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> v. </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">Melleja</span> (84 Phil. 794), the term "claims"
required to be presented against a decedent's estate is generally construed to
mean debts or demands of a pecuniary nature which could have been enforced
against the deceased in his lifetime or liability contracted by the deceased
before his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>important to note that <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> claims for attorney’s fees and transportation as <span style="">well </span>as
representation expenses are for services rendered to the alleged substituted heirs
of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> and such services did not inure
to the benefit of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> or his
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court charged with the
settle­ment of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> is
bound to protect the estate from any disbursements based on claims not
chargeable to the estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> contention
that he was deprived of due process, on the ground that he was not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as party respondent in, and required to answer
the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, subject of this Court's decision dated 25
April 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the promulgation of
said decision, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> had <span style="">alrea</span>d<span style="">y filed a </span><span style="">motion </span>for intervention<font size="2"><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></font>
and the allegations set forth therein were duly considered and studied by the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, even if Gomez was
not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as party respondent in said petition
for <i>certiorari</i>, his act of filing the said motion for intervention as
well as his present motion for reconsideration, indubitably gave him an
adequate opportunity to present his side of the controversy, and therefore cured
any defect of alleged lack of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's failure to file a motion for reconsideration of the
questioned orders of the court  <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> is not fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although as a general rule, <i>certiorari</i>
will not lie unless the lower court has, through a motion for reconsideration,
been given a chance to correct the errors imputed to it, this rule, however,
admits of exceptions, like:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when the
issue raised is one purely of law; (2) where public interest i<span style="">s </span>involved; and (3) in case of
urgency.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the questioned orders of the trial court were already being
executed, hence, there <span style="">was </span>an urgency which caused the case to fall under one of the
exceptions, thereby allowing petitioner to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with­out need of first filing a motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left;" align="left">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration of Jesus T.
David</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The claim for attorney's fees of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Jesus T. David is for services rendered for the benefit of Dona Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, and not for the benefit of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> or his estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As discussed earlier, only claims which could have been enforced against
the deceased in his lifetime are allowed to be presented against his estate,
with the exception of funeral expenses, expenses for the last sickness<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and administration expenses in the ordinary course thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged attachment and levy of Dona Carmen's alleged <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>’ fees and share in the estate of Don Alfonso
<span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, the same cannot be given force and effect
in the special proceedings for the settlement of Don Alfonso's estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be stressed that the subject of
settlement in this case is not the estate of Dona Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> to
insist on enforcing in this proceeding his claim against Dona Carmen's alleged
fees as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> and share in the estate of Don
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, would be irregular and
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be borne in mind
that the respondent court is one of limited jurisdiction, and it has no
authority to determine as to who are the heirs of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
and/or decide the claims or demands which may be properly paid out of the funds
of the estate of Dona Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such issues have to be determined in separate
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">For this Court to allow in this proceeding - which is for the
settlement of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> -
the enforcement of the claim of David against Dona Carmen's alleged share in
the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, would amount to
summarily declaring Dona Carmen an heir of Don Alfonso, without giving the
other heirs or claimants to the latter's estate an opportunity to oppose the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, whatever fees Dona
Carmen might have earned during her lifetime as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> should go to
her estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, whatever claim herein
<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> has against the deceased Dona Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, should be presented before the court with
jurisdiction in settling her estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> cannot resort to a short cut and present his
claim directly to this Court to suit his own end and convenience thereby
brushing aside the settled rules of applicable procedure.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left;" align="left">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration of the </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">Raquiza</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> children</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Movants</span> would like to impress upon this
Court that the award of attorney's fees to Atty. Mendoza equivalent to 12% of
the gross value of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
is not valid on the ground that they never gave their consent thereto, nor did
Dona Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, then <span class="SpellE">administratix</span>
of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the records of this case shows that <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi-Raquiza</span>, the
instituted heir to two-third (2/3) of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, gave her conformity to such award of attorney's
fees in favor of Atty. Mendoza.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, through their father and general
guardian Atty. Antonio V. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>, had agreed to
grant said attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
separate manifestations<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
were filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> and Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> with the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo,</span> stating that
they were withdrawing their oppositions to said claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to <span class="SpellE">Floro's</span> claim for
payment for services rendered to the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>,
the rule is that where the monetary claim against the administrator has a
relation to his acts of administration in the ordinary course thereof, such
claims can be presented for payment with the court where a special proceeding
for the settlement of the estate is pending, although said claims were not
incurred by the deceased during his lifetime and collectible after his
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so, because the
administration is under the direct supervision of the court and the
administrator is subject to its authority.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the question of whether or not the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
are the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi-Raquiza</span>,
thus, entitled to her share in the estate of Don Alfonso, determination of said
issue is again not within the jurisdiction of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span><span style=""> </span>charged only with the settlement of the estate of Don Alfonso.</p>

<p class="BODY">As discussed earlier, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi-Raquiza</span> and Dona Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
(as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>) had given their conformity to the award of
attorney's fees to Atty. Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner who now is acting as special administrator of the estates of <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi-Raquiza</span> and
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from questioning said award.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as payment of service fees to <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Floro</span>, the same was allowed for services rendered by
claimant for the benefit of the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
and the same falls under the category of "administration expense",
which may be paid out of the funds of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the heirs of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> had dropped their opposi­tion to said claim,
thus, they are barred from questioning the same at this stage.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> (as alleged substituted
heirs of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>) seek clarification of
the term “instituted heirs" and <span style="">a </span>modification
of the decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="25" month="4">25 April 1988</st1:date>,
so that the term "instituted heirs" would include the <span style="font-style: italic;">substi­tuted</span>
heirs of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They likewise move for the setting aside of
the portion of the decision which provides for the final settlement and
distribution of the estate of Don Alfonso to the instituted heirs or their
respective estates, if it would mean that delivery of the one third (1/3) share
of the estate of Don Alfonso is to be made only to Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
or his estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">They further claim that for this Court to order the delivery of
the residue of the estate of Don Alfonso to the estate of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> (to the extent of 1/3 <span style="">as </span>decreed in Don Alfonso’s last
will) instead of his substi­tuted heirs, will result in the latter
re-litigating among themselves and/or with other parties for their respective
shares over the estate of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, when
they had already ventilated the issue of <span class="SpellE">heirship</span>
over the same before the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, and they were declared
heirs of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> and substituted heirs to
his one-third (1/3) share in the estate of Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>' contention to be
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> instead of the estate of the instituted heir,
Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> to receive the residue of the
estate of Don Alfonso would be not only prejudicial to the creditors of Don
Juan but also to the government in the form of non-payment of taxes required by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer of the estate of Don
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> to his instituted heirs (<span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi-Raquiza</span> and
Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>) is subject to payment of estate
taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the estates of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> (and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi-Raquiza</span>) can be transferred to their heirs,
again, estate taxes must first be paid to the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
as substituted heirs of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, to
receive directly from the estate of Don Alfonso, the share pertaining to Don
Juan, could result in a single transfer of property and a single payment of
estate taxes, in fraud of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> has no jurisdiction to
deter­mine who are the heirs of Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>said issue has to be ventilated in a separate

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Movant</span> seeks clarification of the
decision of this Court, dated 25 April 1988, denying his claim for attorney's
fees, as to whether or not it is meant to annul not only the order fixing his
fees but also the contract for services approved in the order issued by the

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Movant's</span> claim is chargeable to the

court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> has no jurisdic­tion to fix such fees for services
rendered not to the estate of Don Alfonso, but to the heirs of Don Juan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>
