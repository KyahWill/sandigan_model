<p class="BODY"><span>This is a petition to review the decision of the 
Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision 
of the then Court of First Instance in Civil Case </span>No. R-642 (7289) 
<span>entitled "<span class="SpellE"><em>Celsa</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Puncia</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Anchuelo</em></span><em>, et al. v. Benito Gavino, et al.</em>" 
for reformation of contract and accounting with damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In their complaint filed on April 27, 1972, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Celsa</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Puncia</span> alleged that they are the owners of seven (7) 
parcels of land covered by Original Certificate of Title (Free Patent) No. 586; 
</span>that on May 19, 1961, they secured a loan from Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> and Juana <span class="SpellE">Euste</span> in the 
amount of P3,000.00 but, instead of executing a deed of mortgage over the said 
parcels of land, the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> induced the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> to execute a supposed deed of sale with the 
understanding that the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> would execute another 
document on the same day to make the transaction appear as an agreement to 
resell but its essence is one of repurchase of the same properties after the 
lapse of nineteen (19) years from <span>the </span>date of execution; that the 
consideration on both documents in <span>the </span>amount <span>of 
</span>P28,000.00 is fictitious, the truth, being that the actual <span>amount 
</span>of the loan obtained was only P3,000.00; that the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> offered to repurchase the properties for the 
actual amount of the loan obtained but the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> 
refused; that Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> had transferred the 
properties to his sister and codefendant Martha <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> 
and thereafter re-transferred the same properties to his other co-defendants 
Jaime and Juan both surnamed <span class="SpellE"><span>Gavino</span></span><span>; </span>that these transfers 
resulted in the issuance of certificate of title to those other defendants which 
were fictitious for want of consideration; hence, the petitioners prayed among 
others, that the deed of sale be annulled; that they be allowed to repurchase 
the subject properties; and that the certificate of title of the various 
defendants covering the subject properties be annulled.</p>
<p class="BODY">In their Answer, the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> denied the 
allegations of the complaint and alleged that the deed of sale correctly 
reflects the true intention of the actual transaction between them and the 
plaintiffs, and that the amount of P28,000.00 stated in the document as 
consideration thereof <span>is the purchase price of the subject properties; and 
that the transfer of the properties from the defendants Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> and Juana <span class="SpellE">Euste</span> to Martha 
<span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> and thereafter to Jaime and Juan <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> were true and legitimate transactions and that there 
were considerations in such sales.<span>&nbsp; </span>They admitted the execution of 
the document "Promise to <span class="GramE">Resell</span>" but alleged it was 
void for want of consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the course of the proceedings in the lower court, Antonio 
<span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> died and he was substituted by his children 
with <span class="SpellE">Celsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Puncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The trial court found the facts of the case, as

<blockquote>"[S]<span class="SpellE">ometime</span> in the year 1954 the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> were in great financial stress which prompted them 
to encumber or alienate seven (7) parcels of their conjugal land.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The seven (7) parcels were mortgaged to the Rehabilitation Finance 
Corporation (RFC) for P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which loan was 
increased by P2,000.00 on <st1:date month="10" day="9" year="1956">October 9, 
1956</st1:date> (Exhibits 2 &amp; 3).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"A loan of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was also obtained from 
the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which was secured by a second mortgage on the 
same property. Three years later, that was on <st1:date month="10" day="16" year="1958">October <span>16, </span>1958</st1:date> the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> obtained once more a loan for P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>. As security they constituted a second mortgage in 
which the mortgagee was to assume the indebtedness of the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> to the DBP.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"As the finances of the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> did not 
improve, interests from banking institution accumulated, they finally conveyed 
the property to defendants Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> and Juana 
<span class="SpellE">Euste-Gavino</span> for P18,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 13) which included the P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> loaned from <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> and, with assumed interest, becomes P7,850.00

Certificate of Title No. 568; and also the amount of P4,541.39 which was paid by 
Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> to the RFC and the amount of P2,104.55 
paid to the PNB. The balance of P2<span class="GramE">,105.06</span> was paid in 
cash to the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1961">May 19, 
1961</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> spouses transformed the 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Pacto</em></span><em> de Retro</em> to an absolute sale 
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">A, A-1 &amp; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 16) <span class="GramE">with</span> the increase 
in price to P28,000.00<span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"It should be noted that from the alleged P18<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> amount of the supposed consideration, there was a 
total payment made by the defendant Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> in 
the sum of P15,995.94 which is short of P2,105.06 to complete the full amount of 
P18,000.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>The defendants alleged that the amount was paid in 
cash (p. 26, TSN, Sept. 12, 1975, Annexes 2, Reconstituted 
Transcript).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Out of the P28<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> of which the sum of 
P18,000.00 was considered paid, there exist an existing balance of 
P10,000.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>How was this amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> paid by the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span>?<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The amount of P5,500.00 was allegedly paid by the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> when Exhibit A and Exhibit 16 was executed as 
explained by the defendant, and the sum of P4,500.00 was covered by a Promissory 
Note dated May 19, 1961 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"From the promissory note above-mentioned, it gives <st1:date month="12" day="31" year="1962">December 31, 1962</st1:date> as the date of 
maturity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, on November 20, 1961, the amount of 
P1,600.00 plus one (1) sack of rice worth P24.00 was received by the late 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> and signed by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Celsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Puncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10-A).<span>&nbsp;

the remaining P2<span class="GramE">,876.00</span> was paid (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10-B).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It is the observation of the Court that Exhibit 10-B leave no 
signature or detailed explanation how<span> </span><span>the P2<span class="GramE">,876.00</span> was paid. There was just a statement which

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds that the sale between Antonio <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Puncia-Anchuelo</span> on one hand to Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> and Juana <span class="SpellE">Euste?Gavino</span> on

executed by Benito <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>After the 
payment of said amount, the case should be dismissed.<span>&nbsp; </span>No 
pronouncement as to damages and costs."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The afore-quoted decision was appealed by the petitioners to the 
Intermediate Appellate Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">Except for making the second paragraph of the appealed decision's 
<span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion clearer by correcting it to read 
as follows:</p>
<p class="2Q">"The preponderance of evidence strongly favors the defendants but 
said defendants are jointly. . ."</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span>the</span></span><span> trial court's decision was affirmed by 
the appellate court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioners was 
denied.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The main issue in this petition is whether or not the petitioners 
have established their right to repurchase the subject parcels of land.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioners invoke two grounds upon which they base their 
right to repurchase the subject parcels of land.<span>&nbsp; </span>First, they 
maintain that the deed of absolute sale (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">A, A-1 and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 16) was fictitious 
and without any consideration and that the true and real transaction between the 
<span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> spouses on one hand and the <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> spouses on the other hand was a sale with right of 
repurchase or <span class="SpellE"><em>venta</em></span><em> con pacto de 
retro</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Second, they contend that they have the legal right 
under Section 119 of Commonwealth Act 141 (Public Land Law) to repurchase the 
parcels of land within five (5) years from <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1961">May 19, 1961</st1:date> the date when the deed of absolute sale and 
agreement to resell was executed.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court and 
the appellate court that the disputed deed of sale reflects the true transaction 
between the <span class="SpellE"><span>Anchuelo</span></span><span> spouses on one 
hand and the <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> spouses </span><span>on 
</span><span>the other.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is clearly seen in the execution of 
public documents evidencing the parties' various transactions involving the land 
and leading to the execution of the questioned deed of 
sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The records show that after the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> 
had redeemed the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> properties by paying P4<span class="GramE">,541.39</span>, P2,104.55, and P7,850.00 to the Development Bank of 
the Philippines, Philippine National Bank and <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>, respectively, and had given the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> P2,105.06 in cash, the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> executed on March 15, 1960 a deed of sale with 
right to repurchase the seven (7) parcels in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1961">May 19, 
1961</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> spouses executed a "deed 
of repurchase" in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> where the 
land was transferred to the latter for P18<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, on this same day, <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1961">May 19, 1961</st1:date>, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> converted the deed of sale with right to repurchase 
dated <st1:date month="3" day="15" year="1960">March 15, 1960</st1:date> into a 
Deed of Absolute Sale for the increased amount of P28<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the difference of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> paid P5,500.00 
in cash and P4,500.00 in a promissory note.<span>&nbsp; </span>Three separate 
payments on the note were eventually effected.<span>&nbsp; </span>On this same date 
also,<span> May 19, 1961, the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> executed in 
turn, an agreement to resell the properties to the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> for P28,000.00 but giving the latter not earlier 
than nineteen (19) years to redeem the properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>These public documents are entitled to full faith and credit 
on their face in the absence of any competent evidence that their execution was 
tainted by defects or irregularities that would warrant a declaration of 
nullity.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Roman v. Court of Appeals</em>, 
112 SCRA 542).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The records show that the petitioners have 
failed to prove their allegations of a fictitious sale or fraud in the execution 
of the questioned deed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The findings of facts of the trial court 
and the appellate court are supported by the evidence and appear both credible 
and logical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>As earlier stated, on the same day that the absolute deed of 
sale was executed, the <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> spouses executed an 
Agreement to <span class="GramE">Resell</span> the same parcels of land, for the 
same price in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> spouses (Exhibit 
B).<span>&nbsp; </span>Embodied in the document is the following 
stipulation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"That it is a condition of this agreement that the PARTY OF 
<span>THE SECOND PART, </span>his heirs, assigns and successors in interests, 
shall not exercise their right to repurchase said parcels of land subject matter 
of this agreement within the period of nineteen (19) years from the date of 
execution of this instrument but may only exercise their right after the lapse 
of said nineteen years from date of the execution of this 
agreement."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>This stipulation clearly violates Article 1601 of the Civil 
Code, which limits the period for conventional redemption should there be an 
agreement to the maximum of ten years from the date of the contract.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Baluyot</em></span><em> v. Venegas</em>, 22 SCRA 
412) Where the agreement for repurchase exceeds ten years, we have ruled that 
the vendor <em>a retro</em> has ten years from the execution of the contract to 
exercise his right of redemption (<span class="SpellE"><em>Baluyot</em></span><em> 
v. Venegas, supra</em> citing <em>Santos v. Heirs of Crisostomo and 
Tiongson</em>, 41 Phil. 342).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The Agreement to <span class="GramE">Resell</span> was executed on 
<st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1961">May 19, 1961</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The <span class="GramE">petitioners,</span> therefore had until Nay 19, 
1971 to exercise their right to redeem the subject parcels of land.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The records clearly show that the petitioners failed to exercise their 
right to redeem the parcels of land within this ten-year period.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioners also invoke their right to redeem the subject 
parcels of land within five (5) years from <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1961">May 19, 1961</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This claim is premised on the 
fact that the seven (7) parcels of land were originally covered by Original 
Certificate of Title No.586 issued by the Register of Deeds, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> on February 11, 1953 
to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> pursuant to Free Patent No. U-2776 
issued six days earlier.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The appellate court dismissed this theory in this 
wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"In the first place, this issue was never raised in the trial 
court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well settled is the rule that questions not raised in the 
lower court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal (<em>Garcia v. Court 
of Appeals</em>, 102 SCRA 597; <span class="SpellE"><em>Matienzo</em></span><em> 
v. Sevilla</em>, 107 SCRA 276).<span>&nbsp; </span>It would indeed be unfair to the 
adverse party if an entirely new issue is raised on appeal as it had no 
opportunity to introduce evidence to counteract this new issue.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Moreover, there is <span class="GramE">a different</span> evidence required 
in order to invoke the right of repurchase under Section 119 of C. A. No. 
141.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Moreover, the Court finds merit in 
the contention of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that even granting 
<span class="SpellE"><em>arguendo</em></span> that</span> plaintiffs can still 
repurchase the land under the Public Land Law, said right had already 
expired.<span>&nbsp; </span>The instant complaint was filed eleven years after the 
date of sale was executed on <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1961">May 19, 
1961</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even the filing of Civil Cases Nos. 5694 and 6184 
cannot suspend the period of redemption.<span>&nbsp; </span>It appears that the 
complaint (Exhibit 20) referred to annulment of loan."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>We </span><span>agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Section 119 of Commonwealth Act 141 
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Every <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of <span>land 
</span>acquired under the free patent homestead provisions, when proper, shall 
be subject to repurchase by the applicant, his widow, or legal heirs, within a 
period of five years from the date of the conveyance."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>We interpreted this provision in </span><em>Lee v. Court of 
Appeals</em> <span>(68 SCRA 198, 204) as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span>There is nothing in the records nor in the factual findings 
of the trial court and the Intermediate Appellate Court to indicate that there 
was a valid tender of payment of the repurchase price during the five-year 
period under Section 119 of Commonwealth Act </span><span>141 </span><span>or 
the ten-year period under Article 1601 of the Civil Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is 
a factual issue which can no longer be threshed out in a petition for 
review.<span>&nbsp; </span>The findings of the lower courts are supported by the 
evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The petitioners contend that two civil cases filed ahead of 
Civil Case No. R-642 (7289) should be deemed to have suspended the running of 
the ten-year period to repurchase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The contention is without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The first case, CC No. 5694 filed on </span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1963"><span>November 5, 1963</span></st1:date><span> 
was for annulment of loan.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the complaint to 
indicate that it was filed to exercise the right of repurchase.<span>&nbsp; </span>We 
cannot read into the complaint something which is not 
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The second case, CC No. 6184 was entitled annulment of sale and 
repurchase of property.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was filed on <st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1966">June 24, 1966</st1:date> but was dismissed because of the 
petitioners’ failure to prosecute their case.</p>
<p class="BODY">The complaint which gave rise to the present peti<span>tion was 
</span>filed <span>on </span><st1:date month="4" day="21" year="1972">April 21, 
1972</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Anchuelo</span> spouses 
averred in this complaint in Civil Case no. R-642 (7289) that "this case is the 
same as the one filed in Branch III of this Honorable Court in Civil Case No. 
6184 which was dismissed without prejudice, however, upon suggestion by the 
Presiding Judge, this case is instituted in order to avail further delays in the 
proceedings for relief under Section 38 of the Rules of Court".</p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioners' averments indicate that not one of <span>the 
</span>cases earlier filed could suspend the running of the ten-year period or 
constitute a valid tender in an effort to repurchase.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
petitioners question the deed of sale dated May 19, 1961 as fraudulent because 
the agreement was intended to be a mortgage but they were "induced <span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>to execute a supposed 
deed of sale".<span>&nbsp; </span>The petitioners question the P28<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> consideration as fictitious because the loan they 
obtained was only P3,000.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>They question the transactions as 
illegal and the result of the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> taking advantage 
of their financial necessity and "mental strains".<span>&nbsp; </span>The complaint 
alleges post offers to repurchase for the actual amount of the loan, meaning 
P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, which the respondents allegedly 
rejected.<span>&nbsp; </span>While the prayer includes a clause "that the plaintiffs 
be allowed to repurchase the properties in question", the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span> asked that they be paid P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> annually by the <span class="SpellE">Gavinos</span> 
from 1961 instead of offering any amount to indicate a willingness to buy back 
the properties.<span>&nbsp; </span>The theory of the <span>petitioners </span>is that 
the deed of sale is fraudulent and <span>fictitious.<span>&nbsp; </span>If there was 
no valid sale, there is nothing to repurchase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The inevitable conclusion is that the petitioners did not exercise 
their right to redeem the subject parcels of land within the ten-year 
prescriptive period.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was only after the ten-year period had 
already lapsed that the present case was filed.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was only then 
that the petitioners pursued their right to repurchase the subject parcels of 
land but without any tender of payment and in terms contradictory of a desire 
<span>to </span>repurchase.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is to be noted that the lower courts ordered the private 
respondents to pay the petitioners the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,876.00</span> as the remaining balance of the former in the 
P28,000.00 price of the subject parcels of land.<span>&nbsp; </span>This amount was 
arrived at after deducting P1<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> and P24.00 paid by 
the private respondents to cover their P4,500.00 promissory note which was part 
of the P28,000.00 total price for the parcels of land.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
discrepancy is not explained by the evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>The respondents 
claim to have paid it as shown by an </span><st1:date month="8" day="26" year="1962"><span>August 26, 1962</span></st1:date><span> statement which reads 
"Paid all total.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><st1:date month="8" day="26" year="1962"><span>August 26, 1962</span></st1:date><span>. 
<span>&nbsp;</span>OK".<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court ruled that since no specific 
amount was mentioned and the note was in the hands of the <span class="SpellE">Anchuelos</span>, it is not proof of payment.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
computation is incorrect as the remainder after deducting P1<span class="GramE">,624.00</span> from P4,500.00 is P2,876.00 and not 
P3,876.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is hereby DENIED.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Except for the MODIFICATION that the private respondents are ordered to 
pay the petitioners P2<span class="GramE">,876.00</span>, the decision of the 
respondent court is AFFIRMED.</p>
