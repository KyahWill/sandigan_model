(BOE) committed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">grave </span>abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying petitioners'
request for transfer of venue from Manila to <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of law pertinent to this petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is </span>Section 10 of the Public Service Act

<p class="BODY">On November 22, 25 and 26, 1985, BOE received various telegrams
from Antonio Diaz, petitioner Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tesorero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City Vice Mayor Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Maskarino</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> of <span class="SpellE">Konsumo</span> <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> which among others,
requested that the hearing be held in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City
since the applicant and the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> come from <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated November 28, 1985, BOE denied <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> request for transfer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">of </span>venue citing as reason the previous similar actions it had taken
on cases involving other electric utilities where <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
therein had also made similar requests for change of venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion dated November 29, 1985 was likewise filed with BOE by <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Madrazo</span>, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dureza</span>, Ely <span class="SpellE">Bretana</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tesorero</span>, Antonio Diaz and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> praying for the postponement of the hearing because
of the difficulty to obtain plane bookings and requesting reconsideration of
the order denying their request for transfer of venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1985, BOE received from the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City Legal Officer a "Motion To Transfer Venue of Hearing" dated
December 11, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1986</st1:date>, BOE received two (2) separate telegrams from herein
petitioners requesting postponement of the hearing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">as Vice </span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Maskarino</span> had made a personal
appeal to the President for the transfer of venue to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 13, 1986, BOE issued an Order denying again <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>' request for transfer of venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 10, 1986, BOE received from petitioner <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, through its OIC, <span class="SpellE">Zafiro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Respicio</span>, a telegram requesting transfer of venue of
hearings for the reason that all <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> are <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City residents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>denied by BOE
in a reply telegram of June 13, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 23, 1986, respondent BOE issued the Order, now in question,
which merely reiterated its previous denials of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>’
requests for change of venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 28, 1986, petitioners filed the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the BOE acted with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in denying the said request <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">for a transfer </span>of venue, without even
giving any cogent reason why it has to prefer Metro <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">Manila as </span>the venue of the said cases considering that, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City is the place where the applicant <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Davao</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>Light and Power Company and the
petitioners have their respective place of business or office, and, therefore,
physical <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and </span>monetary
inconvenience can be tremendously avoided by the transfer of said venue, while
on the other hand, respondent BOE has all the facilities to move to <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City for hearing considering that it is a
governmental agency with all the facilities it can avail which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the </span>petitioners can ill-afford, hence,
the necessity of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>transfer of
venue becomes practical, convenient, economical and reasonable under the
prevailing circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The petition is
unmeritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The BOE has not acted with grave abuse of discretion in holding
the hearings of the three DALIGHT cases in the confines of the BOE office in
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such action by the board is well-within
the sphere of its discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
addition, in denying petitioners’ request for change of venue, respondent BOE
cited as reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the previous similar
actions it had taken in respect to cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">which
</span>involved other electric <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">power
utilities where </span>the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">oppositors</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
therein </span>had likewise submitted similar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">requests for transfer of venue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The utilities aforementioned </span>include <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
Electric Light and Power Co., Inc. (CEPALCO), <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
Electric Company (VECO) and <span class="SpellE">Panay</span> Electric Company
(PECO), whose places of business are located in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City and <span class="SpellE">lloilo</span> City, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides in a similar case filed in this Court, docketed as G.R.
No. 71322, entitled John H. <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> vs. BOE, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">petition </span>therein was filed for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>transfer of the venue by VECO from
the office of BOE in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a
minute resolution dated December 16, 1985, this Court <span class="SpellE">dismisssed</span>
said petition for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners however are not left without any other recourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As what they have done in the past, they can
present evidence in support of their opposition in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">a </span>less expensive and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">burdensome
</span>way if they avail themselves of the provisions of Section 32 of the
Public Service Act or Rule 24 of the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under said rules, petitioners’ evidence may
be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">received </span>in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
itself, through depositions taken before the Clerk of Court of any Regional
