Petitioners-public officials, through the Solicitor General, seek a 
review of the Decision and Resolution of the then Court of Appeals 
affirming the judgment of the former Court of First Instance of Bulacan,
 Branch III, decreeing registration of a parcel of land in private 
respondents' favor. The land in question, identified as Lot 2347, 
Cad-302-D, Case 3, Obando Cadastre, under Plan Ap-03-000535, is situated
 in Obando, Bulacan, and has an area of approximately 9.3 hectares. It 
adjoins the Kailogan River and private respondents have converted it 
into a fishpond.
<p>
In their application for registration filed on May 10, 1976, private 
respondents (Applicants, for brevity) claimed that they are the 
co-owners in fee simple of the land applied for partly through 
inheritance in 1918 and partly by purchase on May 2, 1958; that it is 
not within any forest zone or military reservation; and that the same is
 assessed for taxation purposes in their names.
</p><p>
The Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Director of the 
Bureau of Forest Development opposed the application on the principal 
ground that the land applied for is within the unclassified region of 
Obando, Bulacan, per BF Map LC No. 637 dated March 1, 1927; and that 
areas within the unclassified region are denominated as forest lands and
 do not form part of the disposable and alienable portion of the public 
domain.
</p><p>
After hearing, the Trial Court ordered registration of the subject land 
in favor of the Applicants. This was affirmed on appeal by respondent 
Appellate Court, which found that "through indubitable evidence 
(Applicants) and their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, 
public, continuous, peaceful and adverse possession of the subject 
parcel of land under a bona fide claim of ownership for more than 30 
years prior to the filing of the application" and are, therefore, 
entitled to registration. It further opined that "since the subject 
property is entirely devoted to fishpond purposes, it cannot be 
categorized as part of forest lands."
</p><p>
Before this instance, the principal issues posed are: (1) whether or not
 Courts can reclassify the subject public land; and (2) whether or not 
applicants are entitled to judicial confirmation of title.
</p><p>
The parties, through their respective counsel, stipulated that the land 
is within an unclassified region of Obando, Bulacan, as shown by BF Map 
LC No. 637, dated March 1, 1927.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  No evidence has been submitted that the land has been released or 
subsequently classified despite an Indorsement, dated November 17, 1976,
 of the District Forester, to the Director of Forest Development, 
containing the following recommendation:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Subject area requested for release was verified and found to be 
within the Unclassified Region of Obando, Bulacan per BF LC Map No. 637,
 certified March 1, 1927. However, on-the-spot inspection conducted by a
 representative of this Office, it disclosed that the same was devoid of
 any forest growth and forms part of a well-developed and 100 percent 
producing fishponds. Two houses of light materials were erected within 
the area for the caretakers temporary dwelling. </p>
  <p> "In view thereof, and in fairness to the applicant considering the
 investment introduced therein this Office believes that the release is 
in order. </p>
  <p> "Recommended for approval and be disposed of in accordance with the Public Land Law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Government's cause is meritorious.
</p><p>
In effect, what the Courts a quo have done is to release the subject 
property from the unclassified category, which is beyond their 
competence and jurisdiction. The classification of public lands is an 
excluÂ­sive prerogative of the Executive Department of the Government and
 not of the Courts. In the absence of such classification, the land 
remains as unclassified and until it is released therefrom and rendered 
open to disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  This 
should be so under time-honored Constitutional precepts. This is also in
 consonance with the Regalian doctrine that all lands of the public 
domain belong to the State<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> ,
 and that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership in 
land and charged with the conservation of such patrimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
The recommendation of the District Forester for release of subject 
property from the unclassified region is not the ultimate word on the 
matter. And the fact that BF Map LC No. 637 dated March 1, 1927 showing 
subject property to be within the unclassified region was not presented 
in evidence will not operate against the State considering the 
stipulation between the parties and under the well-settled rule that the
 State cannot be estopped by the omission, mistake or error of its 
officials or agents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> , if omission there was, in fact.
</p><p>
While it may be that the Municipality of Obando has been cadastrally 
surveyed in 1961, it does not follow that all lands comprised therein 
are automatically released as alienable. A survey made in a cadastral 
proceeding merely identifies each lot preparatory to a judicial 
proceeding for adjudication of title to any of the lands upon claim of 
interested parties. Besides, if land is within the jurisdiction of the 
Bureau of Forest Development, it would be beyond the jurisdiction of the
 Cadastral Court to register it under the Torrens System.
</p><p>
Since the subject property is still unclassified, whatever possession 
Applicants may have had, and, however long, cannot ripen into private 
ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
The conversion of subject property into a fishpond by Applicants, or the
 alleged titling of properties around it, does not automatically render 
the property as alienable and disposable. Applicants' remedy lies in the
 release, of the property from its present classification. In fairness 
to Applicants, and it appearing that there are titled lands around the 
subject property, petitioners-officials should give serious 
consideration to the matter of classification of the land in question.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is reversed and the application for 
registration in Land Registration Case No. N-299-V-76 of the former 
Court of First Instance of Bulacan, Branch III, is hereby dismissed, 
without prejudice to the availment by the applicants of the proper 
administrative remedy. No costs.
SO ORDERED.
