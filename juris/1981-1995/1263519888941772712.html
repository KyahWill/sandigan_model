				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A review of the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, finding Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span>,
Jr. and Salvador de Guzman, Jr. guilty of multiple rape and sentencing
"each of them to suffer the penalty of two (2) life imprisonments; to
indemnify jointly and severally Myrna Salazar the sum of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as damages, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay
2/5 of the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of a verified complaint filed by the offended party
Myrna Salazar, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was filed charging
appellants Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span>, Jr. and Salvador de
Guzman, Jr. and three others with forcible abduction with rape and
robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the appellants and their
co-accused <span class="SpellE">Pepe</span> <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>
were arraigned, as the two other accused, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Solis and Edison <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Caras</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> were at-large.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon termination of the prosecution's evidence, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, on motion of <span class="SpellE">Pepe</span> <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>,
dismissed the case against the latter for insufficiency of evi­dence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants principally contend that the lone testimony of the
complainants failed to satisfy the test of moral certainty required by law to
justify the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The challenged testimony of Myrna Salazar, a maiden of 22 years,
is summarized by the Solicitor General as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Around midnight on 13 February 1972, Myrna Salazar alighted
from a bus coming from <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> in front of the Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit at<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">
Carmen, Rosales (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March 1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She waited there for a ride to barrio <span class="SpellE">Barangobong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villasis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> (p. 29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March
1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was not able to take a ride
as the driver of the tricycle that she approached wanted to charge her P7.00
for the trip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She considered the amount
excessive (p. 29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March 1973)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Myrna Salazar decided to walk home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To reach home, she had to pass the <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> <span class="GramE">bridge</span> at Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
reaching the first span of the bridge, she noticed that a tricycle was
following her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tricycle was driven
by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Solis, and had accused Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span> and Edison <span class="SpellE">Caras</span> as
passengers (pp. 29-31, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March 1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the tricycle overtook her, it stopped
and the three (3) forced her inside covering her mouth in the process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once inside the tricycle, the accused began
kissing her (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March 1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tricycle with the accused and the offended
party <span class="GramE">aboard,</span> proceeded to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tomana</span>,
Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> (p. 32, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
14 March 1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused Salvador de
Guzman and <span class="SpellE">Pepe</span> <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>
followed later in another tricycle (pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
14 March 1973).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon reaching Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tomana</span>, Myrna
was brought to an irrigation ditch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
five accused, helping one another, tore her new pants and undressed her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, each alternately had sexual
intercourse with her (pp. 35-36, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="13" month="3">13 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">March
 1973</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">also shows that before the accused had intercourse with her, they
squeezed both of her nipples and took hold of both her legs, then forced her
down by boxing her on the stomach (p. 36, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14
March 1973) and pinning her down (p. 37, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14
March 1973).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After each of the accused had sexual intercourse with her,
Myrna was taken back to Carmen by Salvador de Guzman (pp. 37-38, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="3">14 March 1973</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was already about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning (p. 38, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
14 March <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span>,
Edison <span class="SpellE">Caras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Solis and <span class="SpellE">Pepe</span> <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>
were left behind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching Carmen,
the offended party left de Guzman immediately and reported to the policemen on
duty at the police outpost at Carmen (p. 40, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14
March 1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The policemen took her to
the Municipal Hall of Rosales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she
arrived at the Municipal Hall, all the accused were already there (p. 41, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March 1973).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon seeing the accused, she tried to box them (p. 41, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March 1973) in the presence of Mayor Yu (p. 42, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 14 March 1973) but </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">prevented from doing so by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span> (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 30 March 1973).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The offended party was taken to the Eastern <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Hospital on 14 February 1973 by the police
(Exhibit "A") where she was physically examined by Dr.
Asuncion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pat. Agustin <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span> of the police force
of Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, testified that at about 6:00
in the morning of February 14, 1972, Myrna Salazar arrived at the police
outpost in Barrio Carmen and reported the crime committed against her honor by
the five accused; that after appel­lants and two of their co-accused had been
arrested and brought face to face with complainant at the police head­quarters
that morning, she pointed to them as her abusers and, in an outburst of
indignation, hit them with her fists.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The pertinent entries
made by the Chief of Police in the police blotter on August 14, 1972 read as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On or about 12:00 midnight, 13 February 1972, in Carmen,
Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, one Miss Myrna Salazar y <span class="SpellE">Careg</span>, 20 years old, single, and a resident of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Barongobong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villasis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, while on her way home along the <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> bridge within Carmen vicinity was held up by five
(5) male persons boarded in a motorized tricycle, once they rode her they drove
back in tricycle towards <span class="SpellE">Tomana</span> East with her mouth
covered with their palm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arriving at <span class="SpellE">Tomana</span> East, they dragged her in the irrigation canal
wherein they abused her one after the other after which, due to the existence
of their interest of gain said five (5) male persons took with them 2 rings,
necklace and P100.00 pesos cash of the victim, all in the total value of
P315.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Victim was submitted to <span class="SpellE">Tayug</span> Emergency Hospital for phy­sical examination and
found positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Four (4) suspects namely
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span>, Salvador de Guzman, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Solis and Edison <span class="SpellE">Caras</span>
were picked up whereby victim identified them as the same persons who robbed
and abused her." (Exhibit "A", p. 33, original record)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That same morning, Myrna was brought to the Eastern <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Hospital where she was physically examined by
Dr. Romeo Asuncion, resident physician of said hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His findings are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>FINDINGS:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(External)</blockquote>

<blockquote>- Abrasions, dorsum, left
hand; posterior aspect, left forearm; lateral aspect, right forearm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>- Contusion with <span class="SpellE">ecchymosis</span>, umbilical region.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PELVIC EXAMINATION:</blockquote>

<blockquote>- Abrasions and reddening
of the left labia <span class="SpellE">minora</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>- Vagina admits with
severe pain one finger.</blockquote>

<blockquote>- Hymen with laceration
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(Exhibit B, p. 3, Orig. Rec.)</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Asuncion further declared that at the time of the
examination, the victim was very weak and in a state of shock and distress.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span></st1:place></st1:city>
admitted having had carnal knowledge of the complainant, but claimed that the
act was consummated with her consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
stated that when he met Myrna in the night of February 13, 1972 at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">northern approach of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>
bridge, he introduced himself and immediately professed his love for her, and
that Myrna readily accepted his love; that after kissing her, he brought her
under the bridge where they had sexual intercourse; that thereafter they
proceeded to a dancing place at <span class="SpellE">Tomana</span> and after
dancing with her once, he went home, leaving Myrna with his co-accused Salvador
de Guzman, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Solis, Edison <span class="SpellE">Caras</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pepe</span> <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, appellant Salvador de Guzman, Jr. denied having had
any sexual relation with the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The appeal is devoid of
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of appellant <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span></st1:place></st1:city> that Myrna voluntarily
submitted herself to his sexual desires at their very first meeting provokes
disbelief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It runs counter to the
inherent modesty and high morals of Filipino women.</p>

<p class="BODY">The abrasions found by Dr. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Asuncion
</span>on different parts of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">complainant's
</span>body give ample proof of the struggle and resistance she had put up
against her assailants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, her
claim that she was boxed on the stomach finds solid corroboration in the medical
finding of "contusion with <span class="SpellE">ecchymosis</span> in the
umbilical region." The charge of intercourse with the use of force is thus
sustained by the physical evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bare denial by appellant de Guzman of any participation in
the crime should likewise be rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As correctly observed by the trial court, "in weighing
contradictory declarations and statements, greater weight must be given to the
positive testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution than to the denials of
the defendant (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bargon</span>, 76 Phil. 702;
People vs. Gonzales, et al., 76 Phil. 473; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Macalindong</span>,
76 Phil. 917; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Osi</span>, 85 Phil. 592)."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is moreover significant that when appellants were brought face
to face with the complainants at the police station just a few hours after the
incident, she unhesitatingly pointed to them as the persons who abused
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, she vented her
rage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">by hitting them with her
fists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This spontaneous reaction on her
part while still in the state of emotional shock emphasizes the <span class="SpellE">positiveness</span> and certitude of her identification of the
rapists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Appellants assail the
credibility of complainant's testimony by citing the discrepancies between her
statements at the preliminary investigation and the testimony she gave in open
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These variations are recited in
their brief as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In her direct testimony, Myrna Salazar claimed
that three persons namely Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Solis and Edison <span class="SpellE">Caras</span>
were the ones riding in the tricycle who overtook her and grabbed her inside (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 30, 14 March 1972 Myrna).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, in her
Sworn Statement given on <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="2">14 February
 1972</st1:date> (Exhibit 2), particularly question No. 10 and its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">answer, the complainant pointed to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span> and Edison <span class="SpellE">Caras</span> <u>only</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In her direct testimony, Myrna stated that the

the stomach (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 36, <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="3">14 March 1972</st1:date>, Myrna)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The inconsistencies cited, referring as they do to the
complainant's perception and recollection of mere inconsequential details of
the incident, do not affect her credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of any showing that such inconsistencies were motivated
by any deliberate attempt to distort the truth, the lower court did not err in
giving credence to complainant's testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, considering that five persons participated in the commission
of the crime and that she was then in a state of shock and distress,
complainant could not have been expected to remember with precision such minor
details as the number of persons riding in the tricycle which caught up with
her, or the sequence in which the accused took turns in abusing her, or whether
they boxed her before they undressed her and touched her nipples.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is decisive is that her declarations at
the preliminary investigation and the testimony she gave in open court are
consistent with each other as to the main incident and the identities of the
male­factors.</p>
