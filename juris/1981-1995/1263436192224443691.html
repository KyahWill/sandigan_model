COURT OF APPEALS, MAX B. PALARCA AND GOLDEN FLAME SAWMILL CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>REGALADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition stems from the order issued on July 16, 1991
by the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 3, in Civil Case No. 91-57097,
entitled "Max B. Palarca vs. Capt. Arturo Y. Capada, PN," denying
petitioner's motion for leave to intervene therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The said case was initiated by private respondent Palarca in a
complaint filed on May 9, 1991 for the recovery of two barges named
"Bangsi" and "Dangsol" from the possession of the First
Coast Guard District, Philippine Coast Guard, and seeking the issuance of a
writ of replevin for that purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 21, 1991, the lower court, after the filing by said
private respondent of the requisite bond of P600,000.00, executed in favor of
therein defendant and private respondent Golden Flame Sawmill Corporation, as
defendant-intervenor, issued a writ of replevin for the seizure of the two
barges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the implementing sheriff submitted a report to the
trial court, dated May 27, 1991, to the effect that the barges in the custody
of the Philippine Coast Guard were "BCRC I" and "BCRC II,"
allegedly with descriptions different from "Bangsi" and
"Dangsol." In order to properly determine the correct identities of
the two barges in the custody of the Philippine Coast Guard, the trial court
ordered the re-admeasurement thereof by the Marine Surveyor of the Philippine
Coast Guard in the presence of the representatives of both parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, private respondent Golden Flame Sawmill Corporation
filed an urgent motion for intervention, claiming ownership over the two barges
which it allegedly acquired from herein petitioner in a public auction sale, as
evidenced by a certificate of sale thereof.  On May 30, 1991, the trial court issued an order allowing respondent
Golden Flame Sawmill to intervene in said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 8, 1991, herein petitioner also filed a motion in the
trial court seeking leave to likewise intervene in the case on the ground that
it is the owner of the two <span style="">barges in question on the strength of xerox copies of </span>certain
documents issued by the Philippine Coast Guard consequent to its purchase of
four barges from Mahogany Products (Phil.) Inc. on May 30, 1979.  Respondent Golden Flame Sawmill Corporation
filed an opposition thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, on July 16, 1991 the trial court issued an
order denying petitioner's motion for leave to intervene and ordering the
release of the two barges, whether identified as "Bangsi" and
"Dangsol" or "BCRC I" and "BCRC II", to
respondent Palarca upon the security of the replevin bond of P600,000.00 that
he had filed.  The pertinent part of the
order reads:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x it appearing that the said
movant (petitioner) has not alleged any legal interest over the matter in
litigation, which are the two barges involved, or in the success of either of
the plaintiff, defendant or defendant-intervenor, or legal interest against all
of them, or that said movant is so situated as to be adversely affected by a
distribution or disposition of the said property (2 barges) now in the custody
of the Court; and considering the claim of defendant-intervenor that the two
barges were already sold at public auction sometime in April, 1989, due to the
failure of the said movant to pay a loan, for which the said barges were
pledged, thereby divesting movant of any right over said barges, and finally,
considering that the said motion will not only unduly delay this case or
prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, but also the
said movant may protect its rights, if it has any rights at all, in a separate
proceedings (sic), the Court is constrained to deny the motion for lack of
merit." <a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith, petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
before respondent Court of Appeals which, however, dismissed said petition on
August 30, 1991 in CA-G.R. SP No. 25474.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> Hence
this appeal, wherein <span style="">petitioner impugns the correctness of the judgment of respondent
court and, for good measure albeit improperly, contends that the Court of
Appeals gravely abused its discretion in affirming the order of the court </span><i><span style="">a quo </span></i><span style="">which
denied petitioner's motion for leave to intervene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree, in light of settled principles on which we shall
essay a restatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right to intervene is not an absolute right.  The statutory rules or conditions for the
right of intervention must be shown.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The procedure to secure the right to
intervene is to a great extent fixed by the statute or rule, and intervention
can, as a rule, be secured only in accordance with the terms of the applicable
provision.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Under our rules on intervention, the allowance or disallowance of a motion to
intervene is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2(a), Rule 12 of the Rules of Court provides that
"(a) person may, before or during a trial, be permitted by the court, in
its discretion, to intervene in an action, <span style="">if </span>he has legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the
success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or when he is so
situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of
property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">The permissive tenor of the provision on intervention shows the
intention of the rules to give to the court the full measure of discretion in
permitting or disallowing the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> The
discretion of the court, once exercised, cannot be reviewed by <i>certiorari</i>
nor controlled by <i>mandamus</i> <span style="">save in instances where such discretion has
been so exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">As a general guide in determining whether a
party may intervene, the court shall consider whether or not the intervention
will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original
parties, and whether or not the intervenor's rights may be fully protected in a
separate proceeding.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, there is no showing of grave abuse of
discretion on the part of the trial court.  It denied petitioner's motion for intervention by reason of its
findings, which were affirmed by respondent Court of Appeals, that the
intervention would only unduly delay the case and prejudice the adjudication of
the rights of the original parties; that herein petitioner has no legal
interest in the matter in litigation; and that at any rate, his rights, if any,
can be ventilated and protected in a separate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said findings of the trial court are not <span style="">without </span>rational bases.  It is admitted by petitioner that the two
barges which are the subject of the litigation have already been sold to
defendant-intervenor, herein respondent Golden Flame Sawmill Corporation, in a
public auction held on April 17, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> In
fact, the corresponding certificates of sale therefor have been issued in the
name <span style="">of </span><span style="">said respondent </span><span style="">corporation.  These certificates of sale </span><span style="">constituted the very reason why </span>it <span style="">was allowed to intervene in the main case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's claim that the public sale was attended by some
irregularities and was, therefore, invalid could <span style="">evidently </span>be better threshed out in an independent
proceeding.  To allow petitioner to
intervene in the replevin suit, which is primarily on the issue of possession,
would only make the proceedings therein <span style="">unnecessarily complicated.  New and unrelated issues on conflicting
claims of ownership, authenticity of documents </span><span style="">of title and </span><span style="">regularity in the mode of
acquisition thereof could expectedly be raised and inevitably cause delay in
the adjudication of the rights claimed by the original parties.  </span><span style="">This is not the policy of our procedural
law on the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is firmly settled in </span>this
jurisdiction that intervention <span style="">will not
</span>be allowed when it <span style="">will </span>unduly
delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the principal <span style="">parties, especially if intervenor's rights </span>may
be fully protected in a separate proceeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Intervention is not intended to change the nature and character of the action
itself,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
or to stop or delay the placid operation of the machinery of the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The remedy of intervention is not proper where it will have the effect of
retarding the principal suit or delaying the trial of the action.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also, in general, an independent controversy cannot be injected
into a suit by intervention,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
hence such intervention will not be allowed where it would enlarge the issues
in the action and expand the scope of the remedies.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>It is not proper where there are certain
facts giving intervenor's case an aspect peculiar to himself and
differentiating it clearly from that of the original parties; the proper course
is for the would-be intervenor to litigate his claim in a separate suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming back to the petition at bar, it is to be noted that, at
this point, there is no pending principal action wherein petitioner may
intervene.  A decision was already
rendered therein by the trial court and no appeal having been taken therefrom,
the judgment in that main case is now final and executory.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Intervention is legally possible only "before or during a trial,"
hence a motion for intervention filed after trial -- and, <i>a fortiori, </i>when
the case has already been submitted, when judgment has been rendered, or worse,
when judgment is already final and executory -- should be denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner would do well to reflect on the doctrinal rule that an
intervention is merely collateral or accessory or ancillary to the principal
action, and not an independent proceeding; it is an interlocutory proceeding
dependent on or subsidiary to the case between the original parties.  Where the main action ceases to exist, there
is no pending proceeding wherein the intervention may be based.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Also, in taking its grievance to the Court of Appeals through a
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, it apparently ignored the <i><span style="">sine </span>qua </i><i><span style="">non </span></i>for such recourse that there
should be no other adequate remedies available to it.  Indeed, as pithily observed by respondent court, petitioner could
very well have sought reconsideration of the challenged order by pointing out
and proving that the barges "BCRC I" and "BCRC II" are
different from its barges "Bangsi" and "Dangsol"; or it
could have filed a third-party claim over the barges under Section 7 of Rule
60; or, of course, it could have instituted the proper action to vindicate its
claim to said barges under the same provision of the aforecited rule.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>,<b> </b>the petition at bar is hereby DENIED
and the assailed judgment of respondent Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED, with
costs against petitioner.</p>
