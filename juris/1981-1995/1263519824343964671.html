<p class="BODY">We hold that the contempt order is void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not sanctioned by the Rules of
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not contempt of court for a
judgment debtor to disobey the writ of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the sheriff's duty to enforce the
writ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not perform his duty, as
ordained in Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which provides:</p>

contents of a writ of execution</u>.</span> - The writ of execution must issue

order, stating the court, province, and municipality where it is of record, and
the amount actually due thereon if it be for money; and <u>must require the
sheriff or other proper officer</u> to whom it is directed substantially as
