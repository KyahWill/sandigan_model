Appeal by <em>certiorari </em>from the decision of the then Court of 
Appeals in CA-G.R. No. SP-13056, affirming the one rendered by the then 
Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XVI, in Civil Case No. 138472.
<p>
Records show that herein private respondent Aurora Gutierrez instituted 
an unlawful detainer case in the then City Court of Manila against 
herein petitioners Arturo P. Santos and Adelina Y. Santos on grounds 
that she needs the premises for her personal use and the necessity of 
repairs thereon, and that the petitioners were delinquent in the payment
 of rentals.
</p><p>
In their Answer with Counterclaim, petitioners, among others, admitted 
that they are "the legitimate tenants and/or lessees of the subject 
apartment with the present rental rate of P250.00 a month on a 
month-to-­month contract of lease." (p. 62, <em>Rollo</em>)
</p><p>
After trial, the City Court rendered judgment -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Premises considered, this Court hereby renders judgment for the 
plaintiff and against the defendants and hereby orders the defendants 
and all persons claiming under them to vacate the premises in question 
known as No. 1836 Cavite St., Sta. Cruz, Manila and surrender its 
possession to the plaintiff. </p>
  <p> "The defendants are further ordered to pay the plaintiff P2,500.00
 as rentals for the period December 1978 through September 1979, and, 
further to pay the plaintiff rentals at the rate of P250.00 per month 
from October 1979 until such time as possession of the premises in 
question shall have been restored to the plaintiff minus whatever 
amounts may have been already received by the plaintiff from deposits 
made in Court.  The defendants are further ordered to pay the plaintiff 
P1,000.00 as and for attorney's fees plus costs of suit.  All claims by 
the defendants against the plaintiff are dismissed, for lack of merit." 
(p. 74, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioners appealed the foregoing judgment to the then Court of First 
Instance which found the same "in accordance with both the evidence and 
the law" and affirmed the decision.  Thereafter, petitioners went to the
 Court of Appeals on a petition for review and the latter, on January 
29, 1982, rendered judgment as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "PREMISES CONSIDERED, there being <em>substantial evidence </em>to
 support the decision under review, the instant petition is hereby 
DENIED DUE COURSE and is resultantly hereby DISMISSED." (p. 22, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, this petition for review on certiorari, the Santoses submitting 
that (1) they were never delinquent in the payment of rentals only the 
collector failed to get the money and since they whereabouts of private 
respondent was unknown, they were forced to deposit them to the bank; 
(2) the mere sending of a notice to vacate by registered mail which the 
postal clerk refused to deliver to them for the reason of wrong name 
cannot be considered sufficient compliance with the jurisdictional 
requirement of notice; (3) they have been leasing the apartment for 28 
years and are therefore entitled to preferential right to purchase their
 unit under Presidential Decree No. 1517; (4) there is no real need of 
the premises by private respondent; (5) it was an error to order their 
ejectment without complying with the mandatory requirements of Batas 
Pambansa Blg. 25 and the ruling in Rantael vs. Llave, 97 SCRA 453; (6) 
respondent court erred in stating that a contract of lease of 
residential apartment involving a rental of P250.00 a month may be 
terminated at the end of the month without default on the part of the 
lessee; (7) there was improper change of theory on appeal on the part of
 private respondent; and, (8) there was error in affirming the decision 
of the lower court.
</p><p>
We find no merit in the petition.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  Petitioners, in their "Answer with Counter claim" (Annex "B", Petition, page 62, <em>Rollo</em>)
 admit that they are "the legitimate tenants and/or lessees of the 
subject apartment with the present rental rate of P250.00 a month on <em>a month-to-month contract of lease</em>." (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The aforequoted provision of the agreement on occupancy of the apartment
 cannot but mean as providing for a definite period of the lease.  The 
parties expressly agreed that upon proper notice, one may terminate the 
agreement.  As stated in Rantael vs. Court of Appeals, 97 SCRA 453, 459 -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x The contractual relations between petitioner Rantael and 
respondent have ceased after the expiration of the first thirty days 
reckoned from August 1, 1974 but continued for the next thirty-day 
period and expired after the last day thereof, repeating the same cycle 
for the succeeding thirty-day periods, until the said respondent have 
exercised her express prerogative under the agreement to terminate the 
same."
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  Paragraph 1 of Article 1673 of the Civil Code is an exception to
 Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 20.  Said Section 1 of Article 
1673 provides -
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Art. 1673.  The lessor may judicially eject the lessee for any of the following causes: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> (1)  When the period agreed upon, or that which is fixed for the duration of lease under articles 1682 and 1687, has expired;"
            </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p>
Thus, judicial ejectment lies when the lease is for a definite period or
 when the fixed or definite period agreed upon has expired.  The lease 
in the case at bar having a definite period, it follows that private 
respondent's right to judicially eject petitioners from the premises may
 be enforced.  As aptly stated by respondent Court of Appeals, "[e]ven 
on the strength alone of the Rantael ruling, the petitioners can be 
lawfully ejected, regardless of the motive or intent of the 
lessor-private respondent.  We thus see no point in discussing the other
 issues raised except to state that P.D. No. 1517, in referring to the 
pre­emptive or redemptive right of a leassee speaks only of urban land 
under lease on which a tenant has built his home and in which he has 
resided for ten years or more.  If both land and the building belong to 
the lessor, the right referred to hereinabove does not apply." (p. 22, <em>Rollo</em>)
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the instant petition
 for review and AFFIRMING the decision of respondent Court of Appeals.  
With costs.

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING AND CONCURRING OPINION</strong></p>
<p><strong>
MELENCIO-HERRERA, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
Private respondent Aurora Gutierrez, an apartment owner, instituted an 
Unlawful Detainer suit against petitioners-lessees, the Santos spouses, 
on the grounds of personal use, need for repairs of the leased premises,
 and delinquency in payment of rentals by petitioners.
</p><p>
In paragraph 2 of their Answer with Counterclaim, peti­tioners stated 
that they are "the legitimate tenants and/or lessees of the subject 
apartment with the present rental rate of P250.00 a month on <em>a month-to-month contract of lease</em>." In paragraph 11 of their Special and Affirmative Defenses, however, they also averred that they principally rely on their <em>verbal month-to-month </em>contract.
</p><p>
The judgment of the City Court ordering petitioners to vacate was 
affirmed by the Court of First Instance as well as by respondent 
Appellate Court, the latter on a petition for review.
</p><p>
The present appeal by <em>Certiorari </em>seeks a reversal of the ejectment separately adjudged by those three Courts.
</p><p>
The majority opinion sustains the judgment of respondent Appellate Court
 on the principal ground that the lease is for a definite period and, 
therefore, outside the pale of Presidential Decree No. 20, and relying 
on our ruling in Rantael vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 97 SCRA 453 
(1980).
</p><p>
I believe, however, that, upon the facts, the lease involved herein is 
not for a definite period, the period being determined, not by any 
agreement of the parties, but pursuant to Article 1687 of the Civil 
Code, which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "If the period for the lease has not been fixed, it is understood 
to be x x x from month to month, if it (the rent agreed upon) is 
monthly."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Consequently, the subject lease falls squarely within the purview of 
Article 1673 of the Civil Code, the effects of which were suspended by 
Section 6 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25 (formerly Section 4 of P.D. 20), 
reading thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 6. Application of the Civil Code and Rules of Court of the 
Philippines. - Except when the lease is for a definite period, the 
provisions of paragraph (1) of Article 1673 of the Civil Code of the 
Philippines inso­far as they refer to residential units covered by this 
Act shall be suspended during the effectivity of this Act, but other 
provisions of the Civil Code and the Rules of Court on lease contracts, 
insofar as they are not in conflict with the provisions of this Act, 
shall apply."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The related provision, paragraph (1) of Article 1673 of the Civil Code, provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "ART. 1673. The lessor may judicially eject the lessee for any of the following causes: </p>
  <p> (1)    When the period agreed upon, or that which is fixed for the
 duration of leases under articles 1682 and 1687, has expired;"
  </p>
  <p>
  Construing the foregoing provisions together, it results that even if a
 month-to-month lease under Article 1687 of the Civil Code expires, it 
cannot be a ground for ejectment in view of the suspension of Article 
1673(1) by Batas Pambansa Blg. 25. As we have succinctly held in the 
following cases:
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> "Construing Sec. 4 of Presidential Decree No. 20 in relation to Art.
 1673 par. 1 and Art. 1687 of the Civil Code, it is clear and explicit 
that Presidential Decree No. 20 suspends paragraph (1) of Article 1673. 
Hence, the petitioner cannot be ejected at the expiration of of the 
period provided under Article 1687 of the Civil Code." (Salaria vs. 
Buenviaje, 81 SCRA 722, 727 (1978). </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
      x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">x</span></p>
    <p> "x x x The only ground, therefore, apparently available to 
plaintiffs to justify their action is the fact that the duration of the 
lease as fixed by Article 1687 has already expired, or expires each 
month and may be terminated at the end of said month. But this is 
excepted as ground for ejectment by Sec. 4 of Republic Act No. 6359. 
Under said section, the provision of the first paragraph of Article 1673
 is suspended when the period of the lease has not been agreed upon but 
has been only fixed in accordance with Article 1687 and said period has 
expired. x x x It should be noted that in the opposition to such motion,
 Presidential Decree No. 20 which suspends court actions for ejectment 
for leases covered by the same was relied upon by private respondents." 
(Gutierrez vs. Cantada 90 SCRA 1, pp. 4-5 (1979). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <em>Rantael </em>doctrine is not invocable because of the striking 
difference that the lease in that case was embodied in a written 
"Agreement on Occupancy of Apartment" by which terms, "the lessee agreed
 to use and live in the apartment. On a month-to-month basis, beginning 
today". Hence, our ruling therein that a lease contract on a 
month-to-month basis provides a definite period and may be terminated at
 the end of any month. That was a conventional lease as contrasted to 
the legal lease herein. In the case at bar, as found by the Court of 
First Instance, there was no formal agreement between private respondent
 and petitioners, "it appearing that the former merely acquiesced to the
 latter's continued occupation of the property in question" after 
private respondent had purchased the premises from the pre­vious owner. 
The subject lease, therefore, cannot be said to be a lease for a 
definite period, determined as that period is by Article 1687 of the 
Civil Code, for, otherwise, there would hardly be any occasion for the 
application of Section 6 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25. As a matter of fact,
 the Rantael case specifically states that judicial ejectment would not 
lie even though the periods fixed under Article 1687 may have expired.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In accordance with the foregoing, (par. [1] of Arti­cle 1673) 
section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 20 should be understood to mean 
that, as a general rule, the lessor may not judicially eject the lessee 
upon the expiration of the period determined in accordance with the 
provisions of Articles 1682 and 1687 of the Civil Code. x x x x x x 
(Article 1687 provides that '[i]f the period for the lease has not been 
fixed, it is understood to be from year to year, if the rent agreed upon
 is annual; from month to month, if it is monthly; from week to week, if
 the rent is weekly; and from day to day, if the rent is to be paid, 
daily,' and further provides that the courts may fix a longer term for 
the lease after the lessee has occupied the premises for certain periods
 of time). Thus, judicial ejectment would not lie even though the 
periods fixed under the said Articles may have expired." (Rantael vs. 
Hon. CA, et al., 97 SCRA 453, 460 (1980). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Be that as it may, I concur in the ejectment of peti­tioners for, as 
held in Baens vs. Court of Appeals, et als., (G.R. No. 57091, November 
23, 1983), even if the month to month arrangement is on a verbal basis, 
the lease is considered terminated at the end of the month, if statutory
 grounds to eject under Section 5 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25 exist. In 
this case two such grounds are present, parti­cularly, (1) arrears in 
the payment of rentals (Sec. 5[b], B.P. Blg. 25) as found by the City 
Court, which held peti­tioners "culpably delinquent"; and (2) the need 
of the lessor to make necessary repairs, there being already an order of
 condemnation by appropriate administrative autho­rities (Sec. 5[e] B.P.
 Blg. 25), which petitioners admit having received.
