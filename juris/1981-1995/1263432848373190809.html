<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The prosecution evidence narrates
that a team of police operatives from the Narcotics Unit of the Western Police
District conducted a surveillance after “the Office received several phone
calls from residents of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
(Street) that a suspect by the name of Arthur is (was) </span><span style="color: windowtext;">actually engaged in the
illegal sale of marijuana cigarettes at the street of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>" (TSN, October 14, 1987, 29-31).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">A "buy-bust operation"
was then conceived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on 20 April
1987, at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening, after relating with an informant
who admitted having acted as a "runner" (or a person who approaches
would be buyers) for the accused-appellant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Mauyao</span>
(ibid.), P/Sgt. Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> formed a raiding team
composed of himself as team leader, and four (4) others as members, among them,
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Papa and Pat. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>
(TSN, September 23, 1987, 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> would be the poseur-buyer and thus, was handed </span><st1:time minute="10" hour="14"><span style="color: windowtext;">two (2) ten</span></st1:time><span style="color: windowtext;"> peso bills, both <span class="SpellE">initialled</span>
by Pat. Papa </span><span style="color: windowtext;">(ibid.,
7-8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>
would be the arresting officer, while the others would act as back-up security
(TSN, October 14, 1987, 31-32).</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The apprehending party then
boarded a civilian Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> (ibid., 10) and
proceeded to </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">Leyte</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">
  del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="color: windowtext;">, stopping a few meters away from where the suspect
was expected (ibid., 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> walked with the informant towards the residence of
the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, who was then in short pants and slippers,
positioned himself on the other side of the street across the residence of the
accused-appellant, pretending to buy fish balls from a fish <span class="SpellE">baIl</span>
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, more or less, four (4)
meters away from where the transaction was to take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The others likewise took their respective
positions (ibid., 12; 31-33).</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Upon seeing the accused-appellant,
who was just standing outside his house at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="color: windowtext;">923 <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="color: windowtext;">, the informant introduced Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> was
described to the accused-appellant as a "drug addict." Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> then told the accused-appellant that he wanted to
buy "five (5) tea bags." Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> gave
him the two (2) marked ten peso bills." The accused-appellant, in turn,
handed over to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> five (5) tea bags and two
(2) sticks of marijuana cigarettes "as free" (TSN, September 23,
1987, 9; TSN, October 14, 1987, 16).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">At this point, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> introduced himself as a police officer and arrested
the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, after
witnessing the exchange, P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, who was
across the street, "immediately ran towards the suspect
(accused-appellant) and assisted the poseur-buyer </span><span style="color: windowtext;">to </span><span style="color: windowtext;">arrest the suspect" (TSN, October 14, 1987,
34-35).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other team members, upon seeing
P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, also closed in on the
accused-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The accused-appellant then
voluntarily surrendered the red clutch bag tucked to his waist which turned out
to contain ten (10) more tea bags of marijuana leaves and four (4) more sticks
of marijuana cigarettes (ibid., 16-17).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two (2) marked ten pesos bills and some other bills were likewise
recovered from him (ibid., 36).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
place where the transaction took place was well-lighted by a street light
(ibid., 27).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no search and seizure
warrant for the subject operation (ibid., 21).</span><span style="font-size: 5pt; color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The accused-appellant was taken to
the Narcotics Control Investigation Section of the Western Police District and
turned over to Police Investigator Martin R. <span class="SpellE">Orolfo</span>
who also received from P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> one (1) red
clutch bag containing ten (10) tea bags of marijuana leaves and four (4) sticks
of marijuana cigarettes, five (5) tea bags of marijuana leaves, two (2) sticks
of marijuana cigarettes, two (2) marked ten-peso-bills and some other bills
amounting to thirty (P30.00) pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused-appellant was then made to sign the Receipt of Property Seized to admit
that the above-mentioned items were indeed seized from him (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
H; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H-4; TSN, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="8"><span style="color: windowtext;">August 5, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, 11).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Afterwards, the accused-appellant,
in the presence of </span><span style="color: windowtext;">his
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">wife, P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>,
the Police Investigator, and the Chief of the Narcotics Section allegedly
admitted that he sold five (5) </span><span style="color: windowtext;">tea </span><span style="color: windowtext;">bags of marijuana
and owned a red clutch bag containing ten (10) tea bags of marijuana (TSN,
October 14, 1987, 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The admission,
however, was made without the presence of counsel (ibid., 41).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">He was also made to sign Exhibit
E, where the two (2) marked ten-peso-bills were attached, to acknowledge that
the marked bills were "taken and confiscated from the possession/control
of one Arturo <span class="SpellE">Mauyao</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> during a buy bust narcotics operation" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E-3, TSN, August 5,
1987, 8-9), and the Booking Sheet and Arrest Report to affirm that he had,
indeed, sold and delivered five (5) tea bags of marijuana leaves and two (2)
sticks of marijuana cigarettes to a police poseur-buyer (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
I, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I-1; </span><st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="8"><span style="color: windowtext;">August 5, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, 13).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">On </span><st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="4"><span style="color: windowtext;">21 April 1987</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, the tea bags of marijuana leaves and the marijuana
cigarettes seized from the accused-appellant were transmitted to the National
Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for proper examination (ibid., 42).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of the specimens submitted and
the accompanying letter-request for examination, NBI Forensic Chemist <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> Francisco conducted microscopic, chemical and
chromatographic examinations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">All </span><span style="color: windowtext;">three (3) tests revealed that the seized articles were
"positive for marijuana" (TSN, July 24, 1987, </span><span style="color: windowtext;">4</span><span style="color: windowtext;">-6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">For his part, the
accused-appellant denied having sold marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had his own version of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He alleged extortion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He averred
that on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="4"><span style="color: windowtext;">20 April 1987</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, at
about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span style="color: windowtext;">6:00
 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="color: windowtext;"> in the evening, he
was invited to drink at the house of Tina, a neighbor who just got
married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Present were Tina's
brother-soldier, Ernesto Estrada, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Guadialla</span>
and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, a power failure
occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant was
requested by Tina's husband to buy wine, cigarettes, "<span class="SpellE">pulutan</span>,"
"<span class="SpellE">katol</span>," and candles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tina's husband gave P50.00; Ernesto another
P50.00; and Manuel also P50.00, for a total of P150.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant was not able to buy the
above-mentioned items because as he stepped out of Tina's place, he saw a Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> whose passengers, led by a certain Lt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, went down and held him "for verification
only." After he was ordered to board the Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span>,
his P150.00 was taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was told that
it would be returned once they reached the precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, upon reaching Precinct 5, he was
locked-up and was asked to produce a substantial amount of money in exchange
for his release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was shown a red
clutch bag full of marijuana leaves and was told that if he had money, the
clutch bag would not be his, however, if he did not, he would "own"
the clutch bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was threatened and
ordered to write his name on the clutch bag.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="color: windowtext;">2:00
 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="color: windowtext;"> the following morning,
when P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> and the rest of the group were
no longer around, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Orolfo</span> took him out of his
cell and subjected him to an investigation which lasted until </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="16"><span style="color: windowtext;">4:00</span></st1:time><span style="color: windowtext;"> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Orolfo</span> demanded P4,000.00 for his
release, but when he replied that he could only afford P2,000.00, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Orolfo</span> said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Hindi raw <span class="SpellE">pwede</span> at <span class="SpellE">marami</span>
<span class="SpellE">sila</span>" (TSN, January 11, 1988, 3-26; TSN, January
25, 1988, 2-16; TSN, March </span><span style="color: windowtext;">4, </span><span style="color: windowtext;">1988, 3-188 TSN,
April 11, 1988, 2-4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four other
witnesses corroborated the accused-appellant's version regarding the wedding
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One Ernesto M. Estrada averred
that he did not believe that accused-appellant had sold marijuana in the
evening of April 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not one defense
witness, however, testified that accused-appellant was not a drug-pusher nor
did the latter deny that the informant was his former "runner."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">After evaluating the contradicting
versions, the Trial Court rejected the accused-appellant's assertions,
convicted him, and sentenced him to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P20,000.00</span><span style="color: windowtext;">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Reaffirming his plea of innocence,
the accused-appellant now, before us, faults the Trial Court in giving credence
to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses despite irreconcilable
inconsistencies and improbabilities; in admitting the evidence of the
prosecution despite manifest violation of his constitutional rights; and in
convicting him despite the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond
reasonable doubt (Appellant's Brief, 5-6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
185-186).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">After a careful and thorough review
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">of the evidence
on </span><span style="color: windowtext;">record, we hold that the Trial Court
did not err </span><span style="color: windowtext;">in
giving </span><span style="color: windowtext;">credence to the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we
affirm the conviction rendered by the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">While there may be some
inconsistencies in the testimonies of P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>
and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>, at best these refer to
insignificant details and trivial matters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The "irreconcilable inconsistencies and improbabilities"
painstakingly pointed out in accused-appellant's brief are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>
testified that it was Capt. <span class="SpellE">Cablayan</span> who received the
telephone call from the informer, while Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>
said that it was P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> himself; that
P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> stated that the informer came to
their headquarters, whereas Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> maintained
that they met the informer near "where the pusher was selling his
wares;" that P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> said that the
"buy-bust team" stopped at thirty (30) meters away from where the
pusher was, while Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> admitted that the team
alighted from the Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> at two hundred (200)
meters away from the residence of the accused-appellant.</span><span style="font-size: 5pt; color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Whether it was Capt. <span class="SpellE">Cablayan</span> or P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> who
received the call of the informer, or whether the informer went to the
headquarters or was merely met at an agreed place, or whether the
"buy-bust team" stopped at 200 or 30 meters away from where the
accused-appellant was expected, is <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>minimis</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The irrefutable fact is that the
accused-appellant was caught <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> as a result of the "buy-bust
operation." The inconsistencies asserted to by the accused-appellant are
too minor to affect the credibility of the prosecution witnesses who are all
law enforcers presumed to have regularly performed their duties in the absence
of convincing proof to the contrary (Sec. 5[m], Rule 131, Revised Rules of
Court; People v. Yap and Mendoza, G.R. </span><span style="color: windowtext;">Nos. </span><span style="color: windowtext;">87088-87089,
May 9, 1990, 185 SCRA 222; People v. Mariano, G.R. No. 86656, October 31,1990,
191 SCRA 136).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>, both
members of the Special Reaction Unit of the Narcotics Section, a unit formed
precisely to operate against drug dealers, could have had no other motive,
other than to accomplish their mission, which is to enforce the laws,
particularly the Dangerous Drugs Acts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">We have<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ruled,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>time and again, that
minor inconsistencies and contradictions in the declaration of witnesses do not
destroy their credibility, but even enhance their truthfulness as they erase
any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a matter of fact, it attests to the human mind's imperfection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the rule that inconsistencies
in the testimony of prosecution-witnesses with respect to minor details and
collateral matters do not affect either the substance of their declaration,
their veracity or the weight of their testimony (People v. <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>,
G.R. No. 81751, July 2, 1990, 187 SCRA 64, and a host of cases mentioned
therein).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Indeed, when the issue raised by
the accused-appellant concerns the credibility of witnesses, this Court will
not disturb the findings of the Trial Court except in case of an evident abuse
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in a long line of
decisions, has repeatedly held that the findings of fact of a trial judge who
has seen the witnesses testify and who has observed their demeanor and conduct
while on the witness stand are not disturbed on appeal, unless certain facts of
substance and value have been overlooked which, if considered, may affect the
outcome of the case (People v. De Mesa, G.R. No. 87216, July 28, 1990, 188 SCRA
48; People v. <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span>, Jr., G.R. No. 86816, May 14,
1990, 185 SCRA 405:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v. Cruz, No.
L-71462, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 30, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, 151 SCRA 609, and other cases listed therein).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We perceive no misapprehension of facts by
the Trial Court in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The accused-appellant even
questions the non-presentation of the informant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, this Court has ruled that the
matter of presentation of prosecution witnesses is not for the
accused-appellant or, except in a limited sense, for the Trial Court to
dictate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discretion belongs to the city
or provincial prosecutor as to how the prosecution should present its case
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Sariol</span>, G.R. No. 83809, June 22, 1989, 174
SCRA 237).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the testimony of an
informant in a drug case is not essential for conviction to lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the prosecution to present the
testimony of the informant is </span><span style="color: windowtext;">not fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
non-presentation of the informant as witness does not weaken the prosecution's
evidence, </span><span style="color: windowtext;">as </span><span style="color: windowtext;">his testimony would be
merely corroborative and cumulative</span><span style="color: windowtext;"> (People </span><span style="color: windowtext;">v. <span class="SpellE">Cerelegia</span>, No. L-72353, January 30,
1987, 147 </span><span style="color: windowtext;">SCRA 538).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is crucial in this case is that the
accused-appellant was caught red-handed, in the act of trafficking the
prohibited plant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The accused-appellant then argues
that even if assuming for argument's sake that he was truly engaged in the
illicit trade, he would not have sold right in front of his doorstep, in full
view of his inquisitive neighbors and passers-by, nor would he have sold to
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>, a total stranger, and for a measly sum
of P20.00,<b> </b>considering the gravity of the offense and the penalty of
life imprisonment imposed by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">This posture has been discredited
in the recent case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> (G.R. No.
94037, May 6, 1991), where this Court ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="color: windowtext;">"Small level drug-pushing may
be committed at any place and at any time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is completed clandestinely and swiftly after the offer to buy is
accepted and the exchange made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that the parties are in a public place and in the presence of other people does
not necessarily </span><span style="color: windowtext;">discourage
drug pushers from plying </span><span style="color: windowtext;">their </span><span style="color: windowtext;">trade </span><span style="color: windowtext;">as </span><span style="color: windowtext;">these may even serve to
camouflage their illicit operations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the Court has sustained convictions of drug-pushers caught
selling illegal drugs at a basketball court (People v. <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>,
G.R. No. 76893, 27 February 1989, 170 SCRA 681), in billiard halls (People v.

in front of a store (People v. Khan, G.R. No. 71863, 23 May 1988, 161 SCRA
406), along a street at 1:45 p.m. (People v. Toledo, G.R. No. 67609, </span><span style="color: windowtext;">22 </span><span style="color: windowtext;">November 1985, 140 SCRA 259), and in front of a house (People
v. <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, G.R. No. 29844, 23 February 1988, 158
SCRA 85; all cited in People v. <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>, <u>supra</u>)."<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Accused-appellant's charge of
extortion by police officers has not been proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has noted that this is the usual
defense in the prosecution of drug cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But if, indeed, there was extortion, accused-appellant should have come
forward with the proper charges against the culprits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">We, however, agree with the
accused-appellant that his signatures on the Receipt of Property Seized (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H-4); on Exhibit E, acknowledging the confiscation of
the marked bills from him (Ex. E-3); and on the Booking Sheet and </span><span style="color: windowtext;">Arrest Report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I-1) are inadmissible in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His conformance to these documents are
declarations against interest and tacit admissions of the crime charged, since
merely unexplained possession of prohibited drugs </span><span style="color: windowtext;">is punished</span><span style="color: windowtext;"> by law (People v. <span class="SpellE">Turla</span>,
No. L-70270, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="11"><span style="color: windowtext;">November 11, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, 167 SCRA 278).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have been obtained in violation of his
right as a person under custodial investigation for the commission of an
offense, there being nothing in the records to show that he was assisted by
counsel (People </span><span style="color: windowtext;">v. </span><span style="color: windowtext;">De la Pena, G.R. No. 92534,
July 9, 1991; People v. <span class="SpellE">Yutuc</span>, G.R. No. 82590, July
26, 1990, 188 SCRA 1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">We have consistently ruled that
any admission wrung from the accused in violation of his constitutional rights
is inadmissible in evidence against him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> Once again, we stress this ruling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">It bears emphasis, however, that
the accused appellant's conformity to the questioned documents has not been a
factor at all in his conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
even </span><span style="color: windowtext;">if these
documents were disregarded, still the accused-appellant’s guilt has been
adequately established by other evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Trial Court's verdict was based on the
evidence of the prosecution not on his signatures on the questioned
documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellant's denials
simply can not prevail over the detailed and unshaken testimonies of the
apprehending officers who caught him red-handed selling marijuana and who have
not been shown to have had </span><span style="color: windowtext;">any ulterior </span><span style="color: windowtext;">motive to testify falsely
against accused-<span class="SpellE">appelant</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 5pt; color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Weighing the prosecution evidence
as against the denials by the accused-appellant including his allegation of </span><span style="color: windowtext;">extortion by the police
officers, we find that his guilt, for drug-pushing, has, indeed, been
established </span><span style="color: windowtext;">beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
