In this petition for review on <em>certiorari</em>, we are asked to 
interpret Section 11 of Presidential Decree No. 21, ("Creating A 
National Labor Relations Commission And For Other Purposes") in relation
 to Sections 1, 3, and 10 of the Implementing Instructions No. 1 dated 
November 9, 1972 issued by the then ad hoc National Labor Relations 
Commission. The provisions refer to the clearance requirements for the 
dismissal, lay-off, or termination from employment of an employee by his
 employer.
<p>
The facts of the case are not in dispute. Petitioner Pablito Ordanoso 
entered into a contract of temporary employment for the period of six 
(6) months beginning from October 3, 1973 to April 3, 1974 with the 
respondent corporation. Incorporated in the contract is a stipulation 
that "it is understood that the company has the right to separate you 
from its employ at anytime within the above period should your services 
not be satisfactory." When the contract expired on April 3, 1974, 
Ordanoso entered into another 6-month contract of employment, this time 
as probationary worker with the respondent company, from April 4, 1974 
to October 4, 1974. A note to the effect that "this extension of your 
employment contract is being given with formal advice that you improve 
on your performance" was added to the stipulation which formed part of 
the first contract.
</p><p>
The respondent company through "group leaders" conducts periodic 
performance ratings on the workers. The results are considered for the 
workers' conversion from probationary to regular permanent employment. 
The criteria for performance ratings were cooperation, attendance, 
quality of work, skill, initiative and interest in work, leadership, 
obedience and intelligence.
</p><p>
In the case of Ordanoso, Mr. Glicerio Ledesma, production manager, 
explained that the aforestated note attached to his contract of 
employment shows that Ordanoso's performance rating during his first six
 months employment in the company was "just passing." Subsequent 
performance ratings of Ordanoso by his group leaders submitted to Mr. 
Ledesma showed that his work performance was not satisfactory. Hence, in
 the memorandum prepared by Ledesma on workers' performance ratings 
which he sent to K. Bachmann, Jr., general manager, Ordanoso's name was 
included among those with below average performance. On the following 
day, Ledesma sent a memorandum to Ordanoso, telling him to improve his 
performance as he only attained a 2.75 rating.
</p><p>
On September 10, 1974, a memorandum was issued by Ledesma to some 
workers, among them Ordanoso, warning them of their low average 
performance with the advice to perform on the average performance level.
</p><p>
On October 3, 1974, Ledesma terminated Ordanoso's services in the company because of his below average performance rating.
</p><p>
Thereafter, the following events transpired:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On October 4, 1974, complainant union (FFW Oceanic BIC 
Manufacturing Chapter) through its union president, Alfonso Leonido sent
 a letter dated October 3, 1974, to the Management of the respondent 
company wherein the union asked the company for a grievance conference 
in order to discuss the dismissal of complainant Pablito Ordanoso 
effective October 4, 1974. Apparently, the parties failed to reach an 
amicable settlement in the grievance conference. On October 25, 1974, 
the complainants (the local union and Pablito Ordanoso) filed a 
complaint with the NLRC, Dept. of Labor, docketed as NLRC Case No. 
Lr-6538. In the said complaint, the complainants charged the respondents
 company and Ledesma for: </p>
  <p> "1.  Unfair Labor Practice; </p>
  <p> "2.  Unjust and illegal dismissal of complainant Pablito Ordanoso; </p>
  <p> "3.  Violation of the CBA </p>
  <p> "4.  Violation of P.D. No. 21 and its Implementing Rules. </p>

select any of the three named in said letter but later selected Atty.

<p>
After due hearing, the voluntary arbitrator issued her decision dated 
April 30, 1976 upholding the company's actions. The dispositive portion 
of the decision reads:
</p><p align="center">

  <p> "Isinagawa sa siyudad ng Quezon nitong ika-30 ng Abril, 1976."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The respondents raise a jurisdictional issue. They contend that this 
Court does not have the power to review the voluntary arbitrator's award
 on the ground that: 1) Presidential Decree No. 442, (Labor Code) 
precludes this Court from reviewing voluntary arbitration awards save on
 special circumstances which are not present in the instant case; and 2)
 the nature of voluntary arbitration awards should be considered final.
</p><p>
Petitioner Ordanoso was dismissed on October 4, 1974. He filed the 
complaint for illegal dismissal with the Department of Labor on October 
25, 1974. Article 294 of the Labor Code, as amended provides: "All 
actions or claims accruing prior to the effectivity of this Code shall 
be determined in accordance with the laws in force at the time of their 
accrual." The law applicable in the instant case is <em>Presidential Decree No. 21</em>.
 In fact, the voluntary arbitrator herself admits this fact in her 
decision when she said: "Noong itiniwalag si Ordanoso noong ika-4 ng 
Oktubre, 1974, ang batas na umiiral ukol sa pagtatanggal ng mga tauhan 
ng mga bahay-kalakal ay ang Presidential Decree No. 21 at mga 
alituntunin nito x x x."
</p><p>
Anent the proposition that voluntary arbitration awards should be considered final, the respondents cite American precedents:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    The nature of an arbitrator's award is that it is equivalent to the 
first law of the parties. It is so because the disputants have willingly
 and contractually consented that the will of the arbitrator shall be 
substituted in place of theirs. For, after all, the parties have 
mutually reposed their trust and confidence in the honesty, integrity, 
competence and capability of the arbitrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such being the case, the role of the reviewer of a voluntary 
arbitration award is very limited. It merely acts a guardian to see to 
it that no serious miscarriage of justice may be perpetuated or that 
public order or public policy might be subverted.
  </p>
  <p>
    The refusal of courts to review the merits of an arbitration award 
is the proper approach to an arbitration under collective bargaining 
agreements. The federal policy of settling labor disputes by arbitration
 would be undermined if courts had the final say on the merits of the 
awards. (Margetta v. Pam Pam Corporation, 354 F. Supp. 158, 1973), p. 
160; cited in Fernandez, Labor Arbitration [1975], p. 355.

  </p>
  <p> We hold that the District Court misconstrued its mandate. The duty
 of the courts is not to determine whether a prima facie case on the 
merits has been put forth by the party seeking arbitration. It is not 
the province of the court to look into the facts of the case. (Chambers 
v. Beaunit Corp., 404 F. 2d 128, Sanitary Corp. v. Local 7, 
International Brotherhood of Operative Potters, 358 F. 2d 455, 458 (6th 
Cir. 1966). The arbitrator is not to be viewed as a special master who 
will be called in after a prima facie case on the merits has been made 
out. (Local No. 6, M. &amp; P. Int. U. of Am. v. Boyd G. Heminger, Inc.,
 483 F. 2d 129); (1973), p. 131. </p>

</p><blockquote>
  <p> It is particularly understood that the arbitral process in 
collective bargaining presupposes that the parties wanted the informed 
judgment of an arbitrator, precisely for the reason that judges cannot 
provide it. Therefore, a court asked to enforce a promise to arbitrate 
should ordinarily refrain from involving itself in the interpretation of
 the subs­tantive provisions of the contract. (Morris v. 
Wenner-Continental, Inc., 466 F. 2d (1185); (1972), pp. 1190-1191, 
Ibid.). </p>
  <p>
    We agree with the petitioner that the decisions of voluntary 
arbitrators must be given the highest respect and as a general rule must
 be accorded a certain measure of finality. This is especially true 
where the arbitrator chosen by the parties enjoys the first rate 
credentials of Professor Flerida Ruth Pineda Romero, Director of the U. 
P. Law Center and an academician of unquestioned expertise in the field 
of Labor Law. It is not correct, however, that this respect precludes 
the exercise of judicial review over their decisions. Article 262 of the
 Labor Code making voluntary arbitration awards final, inappealable, and
 executory except where the money claims exceed P100,000.00 or 40% of 
paid-up capital of the employer or where there is abuse of discretion or
 gross incompetence refers to appeals to the National Labor Relations 
Commission and not to judicial review.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Inspite of statutory provisions making "final" the decisions of certain 
administrative agencies, we have taken cognizance of petitions 
questioning these decisions where want of jurisdiction, grave abuse of 
discretion, violation of due process, denial of substantial justice, or 
erroneous interpretation of the law were brought to our attention. There
 is no provision for appeal in the statute creating the Sandiganbayan 
but this has not precluded us from examining decisions of this special 
court brought to us in proper petitions. Thus, we have ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Yanglay raised a jurisdictional question which was not brought up
 by respondent public officials. He contends that this Court has no 
jurisdiction to review the decisions of the NLRC and the Secretary of 
Labor 'under the principle of separation of powers' and that judicial 
review is not provided for in <em>Presidential Decree No. 21</em>. </p>
  <p> "That contention is a flagrant error. 'it is generally understood 
that as to administrative agencies exercising quasi-judicial or 
legislative power there is an underlying power in the courts to 
scrutinize the acts of such agencies on questions of law and 
jurisdiction even though no right of review is given by statute' (73 
C.J.S. 506, note 56). </p>
  <p> "The purpose of judicial review is to keep the administrative 
agency within its jurisdiction and protect substantial rights of parties
 affected by its decisions' (73 C. J. S. 507, Sec. 165). It is part of 
the system of checks and balances which restricts the separation of 
powers and forestalls arbitrary and unjust adjudications. </p>
  <p> "Judicial review is proper in case of lack of jurisdiction, grave 
abuse of discretion, error of law, fraud or collusion (Timbancaya vs. 
Vicente, 62 O.G. 9424; Macatangay vs. Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, 63 O.G. 11236; Ortua vs. Singson Encarnacion, 59 Phil. 
440). </p>
  <p> "'The courts may declare an action or resolution of an 
administrative authority to be illegal (1) because it violates or fails 
to comply with same mandatory provision of the law or (2) because it is 
corrupt, arbitrary or capricious' (Borromeo vs. City of Manila and 
Rodriguez Lanuza, 62 Phil. 512, 516; Villegas vs. Auditor General, 
L-21352, November 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 877, 891). [San Miguel Corporation 
v. Secretary of Labor, 64 SCRA 60]. </p>

  <p> "It is now settled rule that under the present Labor Code, 
(Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended [1974] if lack of power or 
arbitrary or improvident exercise of authority be shown, thus giving 
rise to a jurisdictional question, this Court may, in appropriate <em>certiorari</em>
 proceedings, pass upon the validity of the decisions reached by 
officials or administrative agencies in labor controversies. So it was 
assumed in Maglasang v. Ople. (L-38813, April 29, 1975, 63 SCRA 508). It
 was explicitly announced in San Miguel Corporation v. Secretary of 
Labor, (L-39195, May 16, 1975, 64 SCRA 56) the opinion being penned by 
Justice Aquino. Accordingly, cases of that character continue to find a 
place in our docket. (Cf. United Employees Union of Gelmart Industries 
v. Noriel, L-40810, Oct. 3, 1975, 67 SCRA 267) The present suit is of 
that category. [Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa La Suerte-Foitaf vs. 
Noriel, 77 SCRA 415-416] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A voluntary arbitrator by the nature of her functions acts in a 
quasi-judicial capacity. There is no reason why her decisions involving 
interpretation of law should be beyond this Court's review. 
Administrative officials are presumed to act in accordance with law and 
yet we do not hesitate to pass upon their work where a question of law 
is involved or where a showing of abuse of authority or discretion in 
their official acts is properly raised in petitions for <em>certiorari</em>.
</p><p>
On the merits of the petition, the petitioner questions the voluntary 
arbitrator's decision that under Presidential Decree No. 21, petitioner 
Ordanoso was properly dismissed by the respondent company without a 
written clearance from the Secretary of Labor, to wit:
</p><p align="center">

  <p> "Nang itiniwalag si Ordanoso noong ika-4 ng Oktubre, 1974, ang 
batas a umiiral ukol sa pagtatanggal ng mga tauhan sa mga bahay-kalakal 
ay ang <em>Presidential Decree No. 21</em> at mga alituntunin nito. Ayon
 sa ikalabing-isang talata ng nasabing batas, walang pangasiwaan na 
maaring magtanggal ng kanilang mga regular na empleado na 
nakapanungkulan na nang isang taon nang walang <em>written clearance</em> ng Kalihim ng Paggawa. </p>
  <p> "Ano naman ang pakahulugan ng batas sa taguring regular na 
empleado? Ayon sa Implementing Instructions No. 1 na nagpapaliwanag sa 
nasabing ikalabing-isang talata ng <em>P.D. No. 21</em>, ang regular na 
empleado ay yaong manggagawa na nakapaglingkod na nang hindi kukulangin 
sa labingdalawang buwan sa loob ng nakaraang magkasunod na dalawang taon
 bago natanggal ang nasabing manggagawa, kahi't anupaman ang taguri ng 
pangasiwaan sa kaniyang pagkakahirang. Alalaong baga, upang mataguriang 
regular na empleado, kailangan ay, una, ang manggagawa ay kawani na ng 
bahay-kalakal nang hindi kukulangin sa dalawang taon nang nakararaan, at
 ikalawa, siya ay nakapaglingkod na nang hindi kukulangin sa kabuuang 
labindalawang buwan na hindi kailangang magkakasunod sa loob noong 
nasabing dalawang taon bago naganap ang pagtititwalag. Kapag mapatunayan
 ng isang nanggagawa na ang dalawang pangangailangang iyan ay nasa 
kanya, siya ay masasabing regular na empleado at hindi siya kagyat na 
matatanggal nang walang <em>written clearance </em>ng Kagawarang ng 
Paggawa. Kung ang manggagawang itniwalag ay kulang sa isang 
pangangailangang iyan, siya'y hindi regular na empleado at hindi na 
kai­langan ang <em>written clearance </em>upang siya ay matanggal. Mapapansin na ang manggagawang higit na matagal ang panunungkulan ang siyang tinatangkilik ng batas. </p>
  <p> "Matapos ang paliwanag na iyan, mamamalas na si Ordanoso ay hindi 
regular na empleado, sapagkat isang taon pa lamang siyang naglilingkod 
sa bahay-kalakal ng <em>Oceanic Commercial, Inc</em>. Kung gayon, hindi 
kailangan ang written clearance upang siya ay matanggal ng pangasiwaan. 
Hindi nalalabag sa batas ang gayong pagtitiwalag sa kanya nang walang <em>written clearance</em>."

The petitioner takes exception to the voluntary arbitrator's 
conclusion's on the interpretation to be given Section 3 of Implementing

kailangan rin ng 'clearance' lahat ng nga pagtanggal ng manggagawa na 
hindi nasasaklaw ng Seksiyon 3 nito. Ang Seksiyon 3 naman ay nililista 
ang mga pangyayari na kailangan lamang magharap ng ulat ang kompanya at 
hindi 'clearance'. Isa na rito ay ang pagtiwalag ng empleado na kulang

<p>
In ascertaining the mandatory nature and the ambit of the clearance 
requirements before termination of employees may be effected, we start 
with the statutory provision found in Section 11 of Presidential Decree 
No. 21 which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "No employers may shut down his establishment or dismiss or 
terminate the services of regular employees with at least one year of 
service without the written clearance of the Secretary of Labor."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The pertinent provisions of the Implementing Instructions No. 1 are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 1. <em>When Clearance Required</em>. - Every employer 
shall secure a written prior clearance from the Secretary of Labor for 
any of the following cases irrespective of whether the employer complies
 with the requirements of existing laws on the service of notice 
terminating the services of an employee and the payment of severance 
pay: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "(a)  All dismissals, with or without just cause, of regular employees with at least one (1) year of service; </p>

<p>
Under the definition in Section 1 of the Implementing Instructions, a 
regular employee is one with an aggregate service of at least twelve 
months for the last two consecutive years prior to the proposed 
termination. Ordanoso was not a regular employee but a probationary 
employee when his services were terminated. It appears clear from the 
law that he was not covered by the requirement of a written prior 
clearance from the Secretary of Labor. Neither was he covered by Section
 3 of the implementing rules which requires a report, not a prior 
clearance, whenever an employee with less than one year of service is 
dismissed, suspended, or laid-off. Ordanoso had slightly more than one 
year of service.
</p><p>
There is a hiatus or gap in the clearance and reporting requirements 
provided by the administrative regulations. As a general rule, such a 
gap should be resolved in favor of the dismissed worker. For an employee
 who has served one year and one day not to have the minimal protection 
of at least a report on the cause of his dismissal while those who have 
served less than a year are entitled to such a report also appears 
incongruous. In this particular case, however, the poor job performance 
of Ordanoso is documented. The hearings before the respondent arbitrator
 establish that the respondent employer did not act arbitrarily or even 
wrongly in declaring Ordanoso's work performance as below the required 
ratings. During his first six months as a temporary employee when he 
should have exerted extra efforts to prove his capability for permanent 
employment, he was at the bottom or barely passing ratings of the 
required performance. He had to be placed on another six months' trial 
period as a probationary worker. During this second period, he clearly 
failed to make the grade. Ordanoso was given sufficient warnings each 
time that his job performance was unsatisfactory. There is no issue of 
due process violations.
</p><p>
The petitioners concentrated on the failure of the employer to get a 
prior clearance from the Secretary of Labor and did not discuss the 
significance of the reporting requirements at all. Under the facts of 
this case and the applicable law, such a prior clearance was not 
necessary. It would also be most unfair to the employer to compel it to 
keep a below average worker simply because ambiguity in administrative 
requirements for clearances or reports depending on the length of 
service and employment status of a worker results in its not being 
instructed clearly to either report a dismissal already effected or seek
 prior clearance before the dismissal.
</p><p>
Considering the foregoing, we affirm the findings of the respondent voluntary arbitrator.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The Kapasiyahan of the voluntary arbitrator is AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING OPINION </strong>
</p><p><strong>TEEHANKEE, J.:
</strong>

</p><p>
I concur on the ground that petitioner Pablito Ordanoso was not a 
regular employee but a probationary employee and there was manifestly 
valid cause for his dismissal or separation as such. He had been given 
sufficient warnings about his unsatisfactory job performance and 
therefore his dismissal at the end of the second six months trial period
 was for just cause in accordance with the terms of his probationary 
employment.
</p><p>
On the question, however, of whether his dismissal falls under section 3
 of the Implementing Instructions quoted in the main opinion, whereby 
the employer is required to submit a report of his dismissal which may 
be effected without prior clearance, it is my view that the gap or 
hiatus in the clearance and reporting requirements should be resolved in
 his favor and those similarly circumstanced. In other words, the fact 
that he and other such probationary workers may have slightly more than 
one year of service would not mean that the employer would not have to 
file the corresponding report of their dismissal. As is aptly stated in 
the main opinion, "for an employee who has served one year and one day 
not to have the minimal protection of at least a report on the cause of 
his dismissal while those who have served less than a year are entitled 
to such a report (also) appears incongruous." The employer's failure to 
file such report would not, however, make his dismissal for just cause 
illegal in view of the vagueness or ambiguity of the Administrative 
Instructions. But the employer who fails to file such report may be 
subjected to such administrative penalties or sanctions as may be duly 
provided.
