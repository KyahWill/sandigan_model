Election Supervisor involving election offenses have to be coursed through the
Provincial Fiscal now Provincial Prosecutor, before the Regional Trial Court
may take cognizance of the investigation and determine whether or not probable
cause exists?</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1988</st1:date>,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Editha</span> <span class="SpellE">Barba</span> filed a
letter-complaint against OIC-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tanjay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC),
for allegedly transferring her, a permanent Nursing Attendant, Grade I, in the
office of the Municipal Mayor to a very remote <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
and without obtaining prior permission or clearance from COMELEC as required by
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the complaint, COMELEC directed Atty. Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Lituanas</span>, Provincial Election Supervisor of <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
to conduct the preliminary investigation of the case; (2) to prepare and file
the necessary information in court; (3) to handle the prosecution if the
evidence submitted shows a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case and (3) to issue a
resolution of prosecution or dismissal as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The directive to conduct the preliminary
investigation was pursuant to COMELEC Resolution No. 1752 dated <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution, in turn, is based on the constitutional
mandate that the COMELEC is charged with the enforcement and administration of
all laws relative to the conduct of elections for the purpose of ensuring free,
orderly and honest elections (Sec. 2, Article XII-C of the 1973 Constitution)
and on the Omnibus Election Code which implements the constitutional
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Resolution provides,
among others:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Supervisors are hereby authorized to conduct preliminary investigations of
election offenses committed in their respective jurisdictions, file the
corresponding complaints and/or <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in court
whenever warranted, and to prosecute the same pursuant to Section 265 of the
Omnibus Election Code." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After a preliminary
investigation of <span class="SpellE">Barba's</span> complaint, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lituanas</span> found a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="9"><span style="">September 26, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, he filed with the respondent trial court a
criminal case for violation of section 261, Par. (h), Omnibus Election Code
against the OIC-Mayor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an Order dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September
 30, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
respondent court issued a warrant of arrest against the accused OIC Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also fixed the bail at five thousand pesos
(P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as recommended by the Provincial Election
Supervisor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, in an order
dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="3" month="10"><span style="">October 3, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">
and before the accused could be arrested, the trial court set aside its </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September
 30, 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> order on
the ground that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lituanas</span> is not authorized to
determine probable cause pursuant to Section 2, Article III of the 1987
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court stated that it
"will give due course to the information filed in this case <u>if</u> <u>the</u>

the prosecution of the case shall be under the supervision and control of the
latter." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In another order dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="11"><span style="">November
 22, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, the court
gave Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lituanas</span> fifteen (15) days from receipt to
file <span class="GramE">another information</span> charging the same offense
with the written approval of the Provincial Fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lituanas</span> failed to comply with
the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in an order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1988</st1:date>, the trial court
quashed the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
this petition.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent trial court justifies its stand on the ground that
the COMELEC through its Provincial Election Supervisor lacks jurisdiction to
determine the existence of probable cause in an election offense which it seeks
to prosecute in court because:</p>

<blockquote>"While under Section 265 of the Omnibus Election Code approved
on December 3, 1985 duly authorized legal officers of the Commission on
Elections have the exclusive power to conduct preliminary investigation of all
election offenses and to prosecute the same, it is doubtful whether said
authority under the auspices of the 1973 Constitution, still subsists under the
1987 Constitution which has deleted in its Section 2, Article III, the phrase
‘and such other responsible officer as may be authorized by law' in the
equivalent section and article of the 1973 Constitution." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 24)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">We emphasize important features of the constitutional mandate
that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> no search warrant or warrant of arrest
shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge
xx." (Article III, Section 2, Constitution)</p>

<p class="BODY">First, the determination of probable cause is a function of the
Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span class="GramE">not for
the Provincial Fiscal or Prosecutor nor</span> for the Election Supervisor to
ascertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Only</u> <u>the</u> <u>Judge</u>
<u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>Judge</u> <u>alone</u> <u>makes</u> <u>this</u> <u>determination</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the preliminary inquiry made by a Prosecutor
does not bind the Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely
assists </span>him to make the determination of probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Judge does not have to follow what the
Prosecutor presents to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By itself,
the Prosecutor's certification of probable cause is ineffectual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the report, the affidavits, the
transcripts of stenographic notes (if any), and all other supporting documents
behind the Prosecutor's certification which are material in assisting the Judge
to make <u>his</u> <span style="">determination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And third, Judges and
Prosecutors alike should distinguish the preliminary inquiry which determines
probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest from the preliminary
investigation proper which ascertains whether the offender should be held for
trial or released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the two
inquiries are conducted in the course of one and the same proceeding, there
should be no confusion about the objectives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The determination of probable cause for the warrant of arrest is made by
the Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preliminary investigation
proper - </span>whether or not there is reasonable ground to believe that the
accused is guilty of the offense charged and, therefore, whether or not he
should be subjected to the expense, rigors and embarrassment of trial - is the
function of the Prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court made this clear
in the case of <u>Castillo</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Villaluz</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">(171
SCRA 39 [1989]):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Judges of Regional Trial Courts (formerly Courts of First
Instance) no longer have authority to conduct preliminary investigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That authority, at one time reposed in them
under Sections 13, 14 and 16, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court of 1964, (See Sec.
4, Rule 108, Rules of Court of 1940; People v. Solon, 47 Phil. 443, cited in
Moran, Comments on the Rules, 1980 ed., Vol. 4, <span style="">pp. </span>115-116) was removed from them by the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure, effective on January 1, 1985, (Promulgated on November 11, 1984)
which deleted all provisions granting that power to said Judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had occasion to point this out in <span class="SpellE">Salta</span> v. Court of Appeals, 143 SCRA 228, and to stress as
well certain other basic propositions, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that the conduct of <span style="">a </span>preliminary
investigation is 'not a judicial function x <span class="SpellE">x</span> (but)
part of the prosecution's job, a function of the executive,' (2) that wherever
‘there are enough fiscals or prosecutors to conduct preliminary investigations,
courts are counseled to leave this job which is essentially executive to them,’
and the fact ‘that a certain power is granted does not necessarily mean that it
should be indiscriminately exercised.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The 1988 Amendments to the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure,
declared effective on October 1, 1988, (The 1988 Amendments were published in
the issue of Bulletin Today of October 29, 1988) did not restore that authority
to Judges of Regional Trial Courts; said amendments did not in fact deal at all
with the officers or courts having authority to conduct preliminary
investigations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is not to say, however, that somewhere along the line
RTC Judges also lost the power to make a <u><span style="">preliminary</span></u> <u>examination</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>purpose</u>
<u>of</u> <u>determining</u> <u>whether</u> <u>probable</u> <u><span style="">cause</span></u><span style=""> <u>exists</u> </span><u>to</u> <u><span style="">justify</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u>
<u>issuance</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u><span style="">warrant</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">arrest</span></u><span style=""> </span>(or
search warrant).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a power -- indeed,
it is as much a duty as it is a power -- has been and remains vested in every
judge by the provision in the Bill of Rights in the 1935, the 1973 and the
present (1987) Constitutions securing the people against unreasonable searches
and seizures, thereby placing it beyond the competence of mere Court rule or
statute to revoke. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The distinction must,
therefore, be made clear while an RTC Judge may no longer conduct preliminary
investigations to ascertain whether there is sufficient ground for the filing
of a criminal complaint or information, he retains the authority, when such a
pleading is filed with his court, to determine whether there is probable cause
justifying the issuance of a warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It might be added that this distinction accords, rather than conflicts,
with the <u>rationale</u> <u>of</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Salta</u></span>
because both law and rule, in restricting to judges the authority to order
arrest, recognize that function to be judicial in nature."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We reiterate that
preliminary investigation should be distinguished as to whether it is an
investigation for the determination of a sufficient ground for the filing of
the information or it is an investigation for the determination of a probable
cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first kind of preliminary investigation is executive in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is part of the prosecution's job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second kind of preliminary investigation
which is more properly called preliminary examination is judicial in nature and
is lodged with the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this
context that we address the issue raised in the instant petition so as to give
meaning to the constitutional power vested in the COMELEC regarding election
offenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article IX C Section 2 of
the Constitution provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission on Elections shall exercise

<u>election</u> <u>frauds,</u> <u>offenses,</u> <u>and</u> <u>malpractices</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In effect the 1987
Constitution mandates the COMELEC not only to investigate but also to prosecute
cases of violation of election laws.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This means that the COMELEC is empowered to conduct preliminary
investigations in cases involving election offenses for the purpose of helping
the Judge determine probable cause and for filing <span class="GramE">an
information</span> in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This power
is exclusive with COMELEC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The grant to the COMELEC of the power, among others, to
enforce and administer all laws relative to the conduct of election and the <span class="SpellE">concomittant</span> authority to investigate and prosecute
election offenses is not without compelling reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evident constitutional intendment in
bestowing this power to the COMELEC is to insure the free, orderly and honest
conduct of elections, failure of which would result in the frustration of the
true will of the people and make a mere idle ceremony of the sacred right and
duty of every qualified citizen to vote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To divest the COMELEC of the authority to investigate and prosecute
offenses committed by public officials in relation to their office would thus
seriously impair its effectiveness in achieving this clear constitutional
mandate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From a careful scrutiny of the constitutional provisions relied
upon by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, We perceived neither
explicit nor implicit grant to it and its prosecuting arm, the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, of the authority to investigate, prosecute and
hear election offenses committed by public officers in relation to their office
as contradistinguished from the clear and categorical bestowal of said authority
and jurisdiction upon the COMELEC and the courts of first instance under
Sections 182 and 184, respectively, of the Election Code of 1978.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An examination of the provisions of the Constitution and the
Election Code of 1978 reveals the clear intention to place in the <span style="">COMELEC </span>exclusive jurisdiction to
investigate and prosecute election offenses committed by any person, whether
private individual or public officer or employee, and in the latter instance,
irrespective of whether the offense is committed in relation to his official
duties or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is the
nature of the offense and not the personality of the offender that
matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the offense is an election
offense jurisdiction over the same rests exclusively with the <span style="">COMELEC, </span>in view of its all-embracing
power over the conduct of elections." (Corpus v. <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>,
149 SCRA 281 [1987])</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the Provincial Fiscal, as such, assumes no role in the
prosecution of election offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Fiscal or Prosecutor files <span class="GramE">an information</span> charging an
election offense or prosecutes a violation of election law, it is because he
has been deputized by the <span style="">COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He does not do so under the sole
authority of his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Basilla</span>, et al. G.R. Nos.
83938-40, November 6, 1989).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, there is no averment or allegation that the respondent Judge is
bringing in the Provincial Fiscal as a deputy of <span style="">COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He wants the
Fiscal to "approve" the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span> <span style="">preliminary investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that on February 27, 1987 (when <span style="">the </span>1987 Constitution was already in
effect) the President issued Executive Order No. 134 which was the ENABLING ACT
FOR ELECTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON MAY 11, 1987 AND FOR OTHER
PURPOSES." Section 11 thereof provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Prosecution.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission shall, through its duly
authorized legal officers, have exclusive power to conduct preliminary
investigation of all election offenses punishable as provided for in the
preceding section, and to prosecute the same:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, That in the event that the Commission fails to act on any
complaint within two (2) months from filing, the complainant may file the
complaint with the Office of the Fiscal or with the Department of Justice for
proper investigation and prosecution, if warranted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Commission may avail of the assistance of other prosecuting
arms of the government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is only after a
preliminary examination conducted by the COMELEC through its officials or its
deputies that section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution comes in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so, because, when the application for
a warrant of arrest is made and the information is filed with the court, the
judge will then determine whether or not a probable cause exists for the
issuance of a warrant of arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Bearing these principles
in mind, it is apparent that the respondent trial court misconstrued the
constitutional provision when it quashed the information filed by the
Provincial Election Supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
indicated above what the respondent trial court should have done was to enforce
its </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> order, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the accused fixing the bail at FIVE THOUSAND (P5,000.00) PESOS as recommended
