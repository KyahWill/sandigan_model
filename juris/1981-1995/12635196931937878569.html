<p class="2Q">"EXPLANATORY NOTE</p>

<p class="2Q">'Sec. 246 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by
Republic Act No. 834, fails to define the words 'minerals' and 'mineral
products' used therein, although the phrase 'gross output' is clearly
delimited. This omission has caused considerable difficulty in the collection of
mining royalties and <u>ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u> taxes and
confusion among tax­payers.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The attached bill seeks to remedy the situation by giving
clear-cut defini­tions of 'minerals' and 'mineral products'. Citing the
American case of McCombs vs. Stephenson, 44 <span class="GramE">So</span>. <span class="GramE">867,</span> and the English case of <span class="SpellE">Hext</span>
vs. Gill L.R. 7 Ch. App. 699 and <span class="SpellE">Johnstone</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Crompton</span>, L.R. 2 Ch. 197. Soto and Morrison define mineral
as 'any form of earth, rock or metal of greater value while in place than the
enclosing country or the superficial soil', Soto and Morrison, Mining Rights,
16th Edition, p. 250. But since the word 'minerals' has been defined by prior
legislation, the definition in Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 137 is herein
substantially adopted to preserve consistency in the concept of the nomencla­ture
in our statutes. In defining the phrase ‘mineral products’, due weight has been
given to its construction in the case of Spiller vs. <span class="SpellE">McGehee</span>,
68 S.W. 2d 1093, and the usual acceptation of its significance among local
miners and mining businessmen.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question whether cement is a mineral product within the
purview of Section 246 of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 1299 as
of June 16, 1955, has already been answered in the <u>negative</u> in several
decisions of this Court beginning with <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland
Cement Co. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, L-18649, February 27, 1965, 13
SCRA 333.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court held that cement is not a mineral product (rather it is
a manufactured product); but the quarried minerals used in the production of
cement are mineral pro­ducts. The latter therefore are subject to <u>ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u> tax which should be computed on the basis of
the value of the <u>quarried minerals</u>, and not the selling price or value
of the cement. On this basis, the Court declared that there was an overpayment
of <u>ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u> tax which should be refunded
because it was assessed on the basis of the selling price of the cement, instead
of the quarried limestone, shale, etc. which were used in the production of
cement. Said the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"There can be no question that quarried minerals have their
own market value. The dispute here arose, however, from the construction given
to the term mineral products, which was defined in Section 246 of the Tax Code
as 'things produced by the lessee, concessionaire, or owner of mineral lands,
at least eighty per cent of which things must be minerals extracted by such
lessee, concessionaire or owner of mineral lands.' Respondent argues that since
the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">portland</span></span> cement produced
by petitioner consists of 80% minerals quarried from its mines, such cement
falls within the definition of a mineral product and the imposable <u>ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u> tax should be based on its selling price which
is its actual market value.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This line of argument suffers from two infirmities: First, <u>while
cement is composed of 80% minerals, it is not merely an admixture or blending
of raw materials, as lime, silica, shale and others. It is the result of a
definite process – the crushing of minerals, grinding, mixing, <span class="SpellE">calcining</span>, cooling, <span class="GramE">adding</span> of <span class="SpellE">retarder</span> or raw gypsum. In short before cement reaches its
saleable form, the minerals had already undergone a chemical change through manufacturing
process. This could not have been the state of 'mineral products' that the law
contemplates for purposes of imposing the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span>
tax</u>. It must be remembered that, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
this tax is imposed on the privilege of extracting or severing the minerals
from the mines. To our mind, therefore, the inclusion of the term mineral
products is intended to comprehend cases where the mined or quarried elements
may not be usable in its original state without application of <u>simple
treatments</u>, such as washing, or cutting them into sizes, which process does
not necessarily involve the change or transformation of the raw materials into
a composite, distinct product. Secondly, respondent cannot use the selling
price of the product in this case as gauge of its actual market value. The
cement here is manufactured by petitioner itself out of materials quarried from
its mines. While the selling price of cement may reflect the actual market
value of cement, said selling price cannot be taken as the market value also of
the minerals composing the cement. And it was not the cement that was mined,
only the minerals composing the finished product.' (13 SCRA 333 at 336-338.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above ruling clearly indicates that cement <u>as such</u> is
a manufactured product (although unaccompanied by a pronouncement that it is
subject to sales tax, because this was not in issue), and is not a mineral
product within the meaning of the law imposing the <u>ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u>
tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">That cement is a product of a manufacturing process, finds
support in the definition of "manufacturer" in Section 194 (x) of the
Tax Code:</p>

<blockquote>"Manufacturer' includes every person who by physical or
chemical process alters the exterior texture or form or inner substance of any
raw material or manufactured or partially manufactured product in such manner
as to prepare it for a special use or uses to which it could not have been put
in its original condition, or who by any such process alters the quality of any
such raw material or manufactured or partially manu­factured product so as to
reduce it to marketable shape or prepare it for any of the uses of industry, or
who by any such process combines any such raw material or manufactured or
partially manufactured products with other materials or products of the same or
of different kinds and in such manner that the finished pro­duct of such
process of manufacture can be put to a special use or uses to which such raw
material manufactured or partially manufactured product in their original
condition could not have been put, and who in addition alters such raw
materials or manufactured or partially manu­factured products, or combines the
same to produce such finished products for the purpose of their sale or
distribution to others and not for his own use or consumption."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the subsequent case of CEPOC vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, L-22605, <span class="GramE">Jan</span>. 17, 1968 (22 SCRA 56), this
Court had occasion to reiterate its previous ruling:</p>

<blockquote>"The issue tendered concerns the correct basis of the 1-½ <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax under Sec. 243, in connection with
Sec. 246, of the Tax Code when made to apply on cement. (Sec. 243 levies 'on
the actual market value of the annual gross output of the minerals or mineral

of Internal Revenue, in the amount of one and one-half <u>per</u> <u>centum</u>
of the value of said output while Sec. 246 defines the term 'mineral product'
as 'things produced by the les­see, concessionaire, or owner of mineral lands,
at least eighty per cent of which things must be minerals extracted by such
lessee, concessionaire, or owner of mineral lands.') The State says it is the
gross selling price of cement <u>qua</u> <u>cement</u>. Petitioner insists that
it cannot be the gross selling price.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The parties here have assumed that cement is a mineral
product within the purview of Sec. 243 of the Tax Code. <u>Our view is
otherwise</u>. As we expressed it in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland
Cement Co. vs. Commissioner, L-18649, February 27, 1965, cement <u>qua</u> <u>cement</u>
is no longer a mineral product in the condition envisaged by the Tax law. Very
recently <span class="GramE">We</span> <span class="SpellE">reinterated</span> and

reconsider the original decision rendered therein. (<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Portland Cement v. Commissioner, L-18649, Dec. 29, 1967)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It results that Sec. 243 of the Tax Code cannot be applied
directly to cement. What <span class="GramE">is</span> taxable <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> are the minerals constituting cement, i.e.,
limestone, silica and shale. (Gypsum, though also a constituent of cement,
cannot be included since it is <u>imported</u> from abroad.) Hence, the correct
basis of the 1-½ <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax is the
market value of the quarried raw materials." <span class="GramE">(22 SCRA 56
at 57.</span> Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Still later, in Republic Cement Corp. vs. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue (June 13, 1968), 23 SCRA 967, the issue once again was whether
the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax should be based on
the value of the finished product (cement) or upon the value of the raw
materials or minerals used in the manufac­ture of said finished product. Speaking
for the Court, the then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The first question is far from being one of first impression.
It has already been settled adversely to respondent herein. In CEPOC v.
Commissioner of Int. Revenue, (L-18649, Feb. 27, 1965) this Court, speaking
through Mr. Justice Barrera, held:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax is a tax not on the
minerals, but upon the privilege of severing or extracting the same from the
earth, the government's right to exact the said impost springing from the <span class="SpellE">Regalian</span> theory of State ownership of its natural
resources. <span class="GramE">xxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> While cement is composed of 80%
minerals, it is not merely an admixture or blending of raw materials, as lime,
silica, shale and others. It is the result of a definite process - the crushing
of minerals, grinding, mixing, <span class="SpellE">calcining</span>, cooling, <span class="GramE">adding</span> of <span class="SpellE">retarder</span> or raw gypsum. In
short, before cement reaches its saleable form, the minerals had already
undergone a chemical change <u>through manufacturing process</u>. This could
not have been the state of 'mineral products' that the law contemplates for
purposes of imposing the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax. <span class="GramE">xxx</span> this tax is imposed on the privilege of extracting or
severing the minerals from the mines. To our minds, therefore, the inclusion of
the term mineral products is intended to comprehend cases where the mined or
quarried elements may not be usable in its original state without application
of simple treatments xxx which process does not necessarily involve the change
or transformation of the raw materials into a composite distinct product. <span class="GramE">xxx</span> While the selling price of cement may reflect the actual
market value of cement, said selling price cannot be taken as the market value
also of the minerals composing the cement. And it was not the cement that was
mined, only the minerals composing the finished product.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We ratified this view in denying the motion for
reconsideration of our decision in the same case. In the language of Mr.
Justice Reyes J.B.L.:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span>
tax in question should be based on the actual market value of the quarried
minerals used in producing cement, xxx the law intended to impose the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax upon the market value of the component mineral
products in their original state before processing into cement. xxx The law
does not impose a tax on cement <u>qua</u> cement, but on minerals products, at
least 80% of which must be minerals extracted by the lessee, concessionaire or
owner of mineral lands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court did not, and could <span class="GramE">not,</span>
rule that cement is a manufactured product <u>subject to sales tax</u>, for the
reason that such liability had never been litigated by the parties. What it did
declare is that, while cement is a mineral product, it is no longer in the
state or condition contemplated by the law; hence the market value of the
cement could not be the basis for computing the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span>
tax, since the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax is a severance tax,
i.e., a charge upon the privilege of severing or extracting minerals from the
earth, (Dec. p. 4) and is due and payable upon removal of the mineral product
from its bed or mine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Soon later, we had occasion to reiterate that view. (CEPOC v.
Comm. of Int. Rev. L-22605, Jan. 17, 1968,)" (23 SCRA 967 at 969-970.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From all the foregoing cases, it is clear that cement <u>qua</u>
cement was never considered as a mineral product within the meaning of Section
246 of the Tax Code, notwithstanding that at least 80% of its components are
minerals, for the simple reason that cement is the product of a <u>manufacturing</u>
process and is no longer the "mineral product" contemplate in the Tax
Code<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(i.e., minerals subjected to
simple treatments) for the purpose of imposing the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">What has apparently encouraged the herein respondents to maintain
their present posture is the case of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Ce­ment
Co. vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, L-20563, Oct. 29, 1968 (28 SCRA 789)
penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Angeles. For some portions
of that decision give the impression that Republic Act 1299, which amended
Section 246, re-classified cement as a mineral product that was not subject to
sales tax:</p>

<blockquote>"This case involves petitioner's claim for refund of
P458,241.45 sales tax paid from November 1, 1954 to March, 1955, and
P427,552.95 ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax paid from April 1955 to
September 30, 1956 from the sale of APO Portland cement produced by the
petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of

246 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, by defining the words 'minerals'
and 'mineral products'), <u>the <span class="SpellE">petititioner</span> had been
paying the sales tax</u> (known also as percentage tax) of APO Portland Cement
produced by it (pursuant to sec. 196 of the Tax Code), computed at 7% of the
gross selling price inclusive of the cost of the bag containers of cement and
the gypsum (a constituent of cement, imported from abroad) used in the
manufacture of said product. After the approval of the amendment of the law
petitioner stopped paying sales tax on its gross sales and instead paid the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax (see Sec. 243, Tax Code) on the selling price
of the product after de­ducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the
corresponding cost of the containers thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is urged by petitioner that since the purpose of the
amendment was merely to clarify the meaning of said terms, the section should
be construed as if it had been originally passed in its amended form, so that
cement should be considered as 'mineral product' even before the enactment of
Republic Act 1299, and therefore exempt from the sales or percent­age tax,
pursuant to the provision of section 188 (c) of the National Internal Revenue
Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We cannot subscribe to this view. It is a settled rule in
statutory construction that statute operates prospectively only and never
retroactively, unless the legislative intent to the contrary is made manifest
either by the express terms of the statute or by neces­sary implication. In
every case of doubt, the doubt must be resolved against the retrospective
effect. There is nothing in the context of the provision in question that would
manifest the Legislature's intention to have the provision apply to taxes due
in the past. On the other hand, the use of the word 'shall' gives the
unmistakable impression that the lawmakers intended this enactment to be
effective only in <span class="SpellE"><u>futuro</u></span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, like other statutes, tax laws operate prospectively,
whether they enact, amend or repeal, unless, as aforesaid, the purpose of the
Legislature to give retrospective effect is expressly declared or may clearly
be implied from the language used. It thus results that <u>before the enactment
of the amendment to section 246 of the Tax Code, when cement was not yet placed
under the category of either 'minerals' or 'mineral products' it was not exempt
from the percentage tax imposed by section 186 of said Code, and was, therefore,
taxable as a manufactured product</u>." (pp. 791-795)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of the foregoing, we conclude that reliance
on the decision penned by Justice Angeles is mis­placed. The said decision is
no authority for the propo­sition that <u>after</u> the enactment of Republic
Act No. 1299 in 1955 (defining mineral product as things with at least 80%
mineral content), cement became a "mineral product," as distinguished
from a "manufactured product", and therefore ceased to be subject to
sales tax. It was not necessary for the Court to so rule. It was enough for the
Court to say in effect that even assuming Repub­lic Act 1299 had re-classified
cement as a mineral product,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:Arial;
mso-hansi-font-family:Arial;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol"><span style="mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol">*</span></span></span></a>
the reclassification could not be given retros­pective application (so as to
justify the refund of sales taxes paid before Republic Act 1299 was adopted)
because laws operate prospectively only, unless the legislative intent to the
contrary is manifest, which was not so in the case of Republic Act 1266. [The
situation would have been different if the Court instead had ruled in favor of
refund, in which case it would have been absolutely neces­sary (1) to make an
unconditional ruling that Republic Act 1299 re-classified cement as a mineral
product (not sub­ject to sales tax), and (2) to declare the law retroactive, as
a basis for granting refund of sales taxes paid before Republic Act 1299.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, we overrule the CEPOC decision of October 29, 1968
(G.R. No. L-20563) insofar as its pronouncements or any implication <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> conflict with the instant decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the above CEPOC decision, Justice Angeles refers to the
Congressional discussions on the bill which subsequently became Republic Act
No. 1299. The said dis­cussions lend additional support for the view that
cement <u>qua</u> cement remained subject to sales tax as a manufactured
product despite the adoption of Republic Act 1299.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the sponsor of the bill, Representative Isidro C. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span> explained that <u>no tax change</u> was envisioned
by the bill, that its purpose was merely to define "minerals" and
"mineral products" in order to clarify the position of our
tax-collecting agencies. Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>:
What is the purpose of the bill?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mr. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>:
The gentleman from <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> will notice that the
provision of Section 246 of Commonwealth Act No. 466, as amended by Republic
Act No. 834, defines only the term 'gross output' but does not define the words
'minerals' and 'mineral products.' There is now <span class="GramE">a confusion</span>
in the fixing of the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> taxes.</blockquote>

No.</blockquote>

The purpose is only to define the words 'minerals' and 'mineral products' in
order to clarify the position of our tax-collecting agencies.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mr. <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>:
My distinguished friend cannot tell us whether it will diminish or increase the
taxes; so, in the face of this uncertainty, I am asking the gentleman if he
will be agreeable to suspending the consideration of this bill.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mr. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>:
<u>We beg to inform that there will be no change of taxes whatsoever</u>. We
only want to define these words because there is a lack of a clear definition
in the Code itself regarding this matter. Therefore, in view of the absence of
any change in taxes, I was just wondering how the taxes that would be coming to
the government could be affected." (Congressional Record, House of
Representatives, Vol. II, No. 50, pp. 1573, 1594, April 12, 1955. Emphases
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since cement as such was subject to sales tax immediately before
the enactment of Republic Act No. 1299, it should remain to be so subject
thereafter, considering that the law intended "no change of taxes
whatsoever."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussion disposes of G.R. Nos. 35668-72 and 35683,
just as it also resolves the identical issue <span class="GramE">raised</span> in
G.R. No. 35677.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some qualifications are, however, in order:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The disputed assessments carry a 25% surcharge
pursuant to Section 183 (a) of the Tax Code [now Sec. 193 (a) (3)] which
prescribes the said surcharge for late tax payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Connell Bros. Co. (Phil.) Collector of Internal Revenue (10
SCRA 469 at 470-471), the then Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
speaking for the Court, rejected therein the imposition of 25% surcharge for
late payment:</p>

<blockquote>"We do not think Section 183 (a) of the National Internal
Revenue Code is applicable. <u>The same imposes the penalty of 25% <span class="GramE">When</span> the percentage tax is not paid on time, and
contemplates a case where the liability for the tax is undisputed or
indisputable</u>. In the present case the taxes were paid, the delay being with
reference to the deficiency, owing to a controversy as to the proper interpre­tation
of Circulars Nos. 431 and 440 of the office of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.
<u>The controversy was generated in good faith, since that office itself
appears to have formerly taken the view that the inclusion of the words
"tax included" on invoices issued by the taxpayer</u> was sufficient
compliance with the requirements of said circulars. (See BIR Ruling 105.2, Aug.
3, 1953; BIR Quarterly Bulletin Vol. 7, Sept. 30 and Dec. 31,1953; in re Fred
Wilson Tax Appeal No. 63.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>"The cases cited in the
motion for reconsideration are likewise inapplicable. In every one of those
cases the liability for the tax was not disputed, the only question being
whether or not the delay in the payment thereof was justified under the
particular circumstances relied upon by the taxpayer. Here the question is
whether or not the deficiency sales tax in question was due at all. This
question does not involve the power of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to condone the penalty, but rather the justifiability of its imposition in the
first place. And <u>where respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
apparently had himself originally adopted an incorrect interpretation</u> of
its own circulars, <u>it would not be just to penalize appellant for falling
into the same error</u>..." (To the same effect, see <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span>
Electric Service Co. vs. Tobias, 33 SCRA 547; <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>,
Jr. vs. <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>, 58 SCRA 170.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the assessments are not undisputed or
indisputable. The dispute as to the tax liability of private respondents for
sales tax on the sale of cement arose not simply because of ordinary divergence

of private respondents was founded upon the original stand of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue itself that cement is a mineral product rather than a
manufactured product and is therefore subject to <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>

production of cement, such as gypsum, conformably with the provisions of
Section 186 [now Sec. 199 (a)] of the Tax Code as it stood during the tax
period here involved:</p>
