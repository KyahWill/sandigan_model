protection of our people against unreasonable search and seizure is not merely
a pleasing platitude.  It vouchsafes our
right to privacy and dignity against undesirable intrusions committed by any
public officer or private individual.  An
infringement of this right justifies an award for damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 22, 1983,
petitioner MHP Garments, Inc., was awarded by the Boy Scouts of the
Philippines, the exclusive franchise to sell and distribute official Boy Scouts
uniforms, supplies, badges, and insignias.  </span>In their Memorandum Agreement, petitioner corporation was given
the authority to “undertake or cause to be undertaken the prosecution in court
of all illegal sources of scout uniforms and other scouting supplies.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in October 1983, petitioner corporation received
information that private respondents Agnes Villa Cruz, Mirasol Lugatiman, and
Gertrudes Gonzales were selling Boy Scouts items and paraphernalia without any
authority.  Petitioner de Guzman, an
employee of petitioner corporation, <span style="">was
</span>tasked to undertake the necessary surveillance and to make a report to
the Philippine Constabulary (PC).</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 25, 1983, at about 10:30 A.M., petitioner de Guzman,
Captain Renato M. Peñafiel, and two (2) other constabulary men of the Reaction
Force Battalion, Sikatuna Village, Diliman, Quezon City went to the stores of
respondents at the Marikina Public Market.  Without any warrant, they seized the boy and girl scouts pants, dresses,
and suits on display at respondents’ stalls.  The seizure caused a commotion and embarrassed private respondents.  Receipts were issued for the seized
items.  The items were then turned over
by Captain Peñafiel to petitioner corporation for safekeeping.</p>

<p class="BODY">A criminal complaint for unfair competition was then filed
against private respondents.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
During its pendency, petitioner de Guzman exacted from private respondent
Lugatiman the sum of THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED PESOS (P3,100.00) in order to
be dropped from the complaint.  On
December 6, 1983, after <span style="">a </span>preliminary
investigation, the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal dismissed the complaint against
all the private respondents.  On
February 6, 1984, he also ordered the return of the seized items.  The seized items were not immediately
returned despite demands.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondents had to go personally to petitioners’ place of business to
recover their goods.  Even then, not all
the seized items were returned.  The
other items returned were of inferior quality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents then filed Civil Case No. 51144 against the petitioners
<span style="">for </span>sums of money and damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In its Decision dated January 9, 1987, the trial court ruled for the private
respondents, thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“<b>WHEREFORE</b>, </span>judgment
is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiffs and against defendants, ordering the
latter jointly and severally:</blockquote>

FOR THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS AND AGAINST THE PETITIONERS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We affirm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article III, section 2,
of the Constitution protects our people from unreasonable search and
seizure.  It provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever
nature for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of
arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by
the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and
the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be
searched and the persons or things to be seized.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This provision protects not only those
who appear to be innocent but also those who appear to be guilty but are
nevertheless to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bench, the seizure was made without any warrant.  Under the Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
a warrantless search can only be undertaken under the following circumstance:</p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 12.  Search incident
to a lawful arrest.  - <span style="">A </span>person lawfully arrested may be
searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the
commission of an offense, without a search warrant.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the evidence did not justify the warrantless search
and seizure of private respondents’ goods.  Petitioner corporation received information that private respondents
were illegally selling Boy Scouts items and paraphernalia in October 1983.  The specific date and time are not
established in the evidence adduced by the parties.  Petitioner de Guzman then made a surveillance of the stores of
private respondents.  They reported to
the Philippine Constabulary and on October 25, 1983, the raid was made on the
stores of private respondents and the supposed illicit goods were seized.  The progression of time between the receipt
of the information and the raid of the stores of private respondents shows
there was sufficient time for petitioners and the PC raiding party to apply for
a judicial warrant.  Despite the
sufficiency of time, they did not apply for a warrant and seized the goods of
private respondents.  In doing so, they
took the risk of a suit for damages in case the seizure would be proved to
violate the right of private respondents against unreasonable search and
seizure.  In the case at bench, the
search and seizure were clearly illegal.  There was no probable cause for <span style="">the
seizure.  Probable cause for a search
has been defined as “such facts and circumstances which would lead a reasonably
discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed and that
the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the place sought to be
searched.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> These facts and circumstances were not in
any way shown by the petitioners to justify their warrantless search and
seizure.  Indeed, after a preliminary
investigation, the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal dismissed their complaint for
unfair competition and later ordered the return of the seized goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners would deflect
their liability with the argument that it was the Philippine Constabulary that
conducted the raid and their participation </span>was <span style="">only to report the alleged illegal activity of private respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While undoubtedly, the members
of the PC raiding team should have been included in the complaint for violation
of the private respondents’ constitutional rights, still, the omission will not
exculpate petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of </span><i>Lim

<p class="2Q">“The very nature of Article 32 is that the wrong may be civil or
criminal.  It is not necessary therefore
that there should be malice or bad faith.  To make such a requisite would defeat the main purpose of Article 32
which is the effective protection of individual <span style="">rights.  Public officials in the
past have abused their powers on the pretext of justifiable motives or good
faith </span>in <span style="">the performance of
their duties.  Precisely, the object of
the Article is to put an end to official abuse by plea of the good faith.  In the United States this remedy </span>is <span style="">in the nature of a tort.” (emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

officer or <u>employee</u> <u>or</u> <u>person</u> <u>“directly</u> <u>or</u> <u>indirectly”</u>
responsible for the violation of the constitutional rights and liberties of
another.  Thus, it is not the actor
alone (i.e. the one directly responsible) who must answer for damages under
Article 32; <span style="">the person indirectly
responsible has also to answer for the damages or injury caused to the
aggrieved party.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While it would certainly be too naive to
expect that violators of human rights would easily be deterred by the prospect
of facing damages suits, it should nonetheless be made clear in no uncertain

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Applying the aforecited
provisions and leading cases, the respondent court correctly granted damages to
private respondents.  Petitioners were </span><u><span style="">indirectly</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">involved in

seizure.  Firstly, they instigated the
raid pursuant to their covenant in the Memorandum Agreement to undertake the

<blockquote>“Indeed, the acts committed by the PC soldiers of unlawfully
seizing appellees’ (respondents’) merchandise and of filing the criminal
complaint for unfair <span style="">competition

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The raid was conducted with the active
participation of their employee.  Larry

Conformably with our ruling in <i>Lim vs. Ponce de Leon, op. cit.</i>, moral
damages can be awarded in the case at bench.  There can be no doubt that petitioners must have suffered sleepless
nights, serious anxiety, and wounded feelings due the tortious raid caused by
petitioners.  Private respondents’
avowals of embarrassment and humiliation during the seizure of their
merchandise were supported by their testimonies.  Respondent Cruz declared:</p>

<blockquote>“I felt very nervous.  I was
crying to loss (sic) my goods and capital because I am doing business with
borrowed money only, there was commotion created by the raiding team and they
even stepped on some of the pants and dresses on display for sale.  All passersby stopped to watch and stared at
me with accusing expressions.  I was
