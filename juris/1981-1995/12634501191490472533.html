				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental in Special Civil Case No. 0224
which denied a petition filed by a vendee a retro to consolidate his ownership
after the expiration of the period of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally elevated to the Court of Appeals,
the case was certified to <span class="GramE">Us</span> because it involves
questions of law only.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Based on the pleadings filed by parties the Court finds that Pedro
<span class="SpellE">Candongo</span>, during his lifetime, inherited from his
deceased parents 858 square meters of Lot 484 located at <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Annex, <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City; that on June 14, 1958, the
surviving heirs of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span>, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carmelito</span>, Benita, <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> and Elena, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span>, sold under <span class="SpellE">pacto</span>-de-retro
in favor of petitioner Pershing Tan <span class="SpellE">Queto</span> for
P1,000.00, 612 square meters thereof as described in the amended petition
redeemable with a period of two (2) years since the execution of the
instrument; that the petitioner has declared the land for taxation purposes in
his name and has paid the land taxes thereon; that the period of redemption has
never been extended; and that the heirs of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span>
have failed to redeem the land within the stipulated period of two years on
June 14, 1960 and that the transaction is indeed a <span class="SpellE">pacto</span>
de retro sale." <span class="GramE">(Decision, pp. 45-46 of the Record on
Appeal.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Cited as respondents in the Amended Petition
for consolidation were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carmelito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> and Elena all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span>;
and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Calimpong</span>, the surviving spouse of Benita
<span class="SpellE">Candongo</span> who died on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 23, 1958</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted
that the respondents comprise the vendors-a-retro except for Vicente <span class="SpellE">Calimpong</span> who is the widowed spouse of Benita.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, p. 31.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Carmelito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> and Elena renounced and waived their
respective rights of redemption even before the filing of the amended petition
on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not file any opposition to the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Vicente <span class="SpellE">Calimpong</span> did not oppose the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the children of Benita with Vicente,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lolita (25 years old), <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> (23 years old), Jimmy (21 years old), <span class="SpellE">Luzvilla</span> (19 years old), Vicente, Jr. (17 years old), and
Edwin (15 years old) formally opposed the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claimed that they inherited their
mother's </span>right of <span style="">redemption and
that the transaction was really an equitable mortgage because the price was
inadequate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on
Appeal, pp. 38-41.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The parties have not
disputed the finding of the court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u> <span style="">"that the transaction is indeed a <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale." Hence </span>the sole <span style="">issue is whether or not the lower court erred
in denying the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In justifying the denial,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When Benita <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span> died on <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1958</st1:date>, her surviving
husband Vicente <span class="SpellE">Calimpong</span> and children, Lolita, <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span>, Jimmy, <span class="SpellE">Luzvilla</span>, Vicente,
Jr., and Edwin inherited from her the real right to redeem the land under the
terms of the contract.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The right of Vito de Vera to repurchase the land under the terms
of the contract is a real right (<span class="SpellE">derecho</span> real) and
consequently transmissible <span style="">to </span>his
heirs upon his death.' <span class="GramE">(De Vera vs. De Vera, CA-G.R. No. 33-R
[L-219] October 11, 1947; 44 O.G. 3318).</span></p>

<blockquote>"Said heirs of Benita <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span> have
up to reaching the age of majority to redeem the <span class="SpellE">pacto</span>
de retro sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right inures to the
other vendors a retro mentioned in the document of sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Article 1620 of the Civil Code, a co-owner of a thing may
exercise the right of redemption in case the shares of all the other co-owners
or any of <span class="GramE">them,</span> are sold to a third person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The share of the late Benita <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span> has remained undivided among her surviving
heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Luzvilla Calimpong,
Vicente Calimpong, Jr., and Edwin Calimpong can redeem not only their shares
under the contract of pacto de retro sale but also the shares of their other
co-heirs by exercising the right of legal redemption." <span class="GramE">(Record
on Appeal, pp. 46-47.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant has made the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE HEIRS OF BENITA
CANDONGO <span style="">HAVE UP TO REACHING THE AGE OF
MAJORÂ­</span>ITY TO REDEEM THE PACTO DE RETRO <st1:city><st1:place>SALE</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"II</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THIS RIGHT INURES TO
THE OTHER VENDORS A RETRO MENTIONED IN THE DOCUMENT OF <st1:city><st1:place>SALE</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"III</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN INVOKING ARTICLE 1620 OF THE CIVIL
CODE UNDER WHICH THE OPPOSITORS-APPELLEES CAN REDEEM NOT ONLY THEIR SHARES
UNDER THE CONTRACT OF PACTO DE RETRO SALE BUT ALSO THE SHARES OF THEIR OTHER
CO-HEIRS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"IV</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE PETITION FOR
CONSOLIDATION OF OWNERSHIP, WITH COSTS."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not find it necessary to discuss the assignment of errors <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The briefs of the litigants have not been helpful at all possibly
because the decision of the lower court is both incoherent and
incomprehensible.</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is that the right of redemption of Benita <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span> passed to her heirs upon her death but no law
justifies the lower court's statement that they "have up to reaching the
age of majority to redeem the <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro
sale." Moreover, the court improperly applied Article 1620 of the Civil
Code where it said that the right of redemption "inures to the other
vendors a retro mentioned in the document of sale." That provision covers
the case where some or one of the co-owners sell(s) their/his share(s) in the
property owned in common but not the case where all of the co-owners have sold
their shares as in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
Article 1620 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1620.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A co-owner
of a thing may exercise the right of redemption in case the shares of all <u>the
</u><u><span style="">other co-owners or of any of <span class="GramE">them<span style="text-decoration: none;">,</span></span></span></u><span style=""> </span>are sold to a third person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the price of the alienation is grossly
excessive, the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> shall pay only a
reasonable one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should two or more co-owners desire to exercise the right of redemption,
they may only do so in proportion to the share they may respectively have in
the thing owned in common." (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since there is no doubt that the period of redemption had expired
without redemption having been <span class="GramE">effected</span>, the petitioner
is entitled to a consolidation of his ownership under the sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is hereby reversed and another one is entered granting the petition for
consolidation of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
