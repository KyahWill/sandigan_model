<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as gathered from the records are as

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Appellant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>
and Pat.</span> Luis <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, Jr. were neighbors in <span class="SpellE">Narangtayan</span>, Sanchez Mira, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
the former having bought a parcel of land adjacent to the land of the latter,
from the same <span style="">vendor.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> </span>When Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> decided to erect a fence on his <span class="GramE">land,</span>
he met with the vendor and the appellant for them to define the extent of their
respective boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out
that some trees planted by appellant on the lot he thought was part of the land
sold to him were inside the lot bought by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pacis</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter uprooted the trees and this caused
a serious rift between the two.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, appellant challenged Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> to
a fight but he was ignored by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At one time, Arnold, the son of appellant, was reported by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain for
being drunk during curfew hours and <st1:city><st1:place>Arnold</st1:place></st1:city>
was made to clean <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> </span>auditorium as penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the incident, appellant while drunk
again challenged Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> to a fight but the latter
kept his cool (TSN, pp. 288-293, Hearing of June 15, 1984).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1979</st1:date>,
Edwin <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span>, a cousin of appellant and his

Criminal Case No. 1214-<span class="GramE">S(</span>81), People v. <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span>) and proceeded to the municipal hall where he asked

riding in his motorcycle (pp. 16-20, Deposition of Cesar Domingo).</p>

<p class="BODY">While Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> was passing by the
store where appellant left <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span>, the latter clapped
his hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This attracted the attention
of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and he stopped his motorcycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bablis</span> went near
him and requested that he hitch a ride (p. 4, Records of Criminal Case No.
1214-<span class="GramE">S(</span>81), <u>Id</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> acceded

down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, they were seen by <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span> who was driving a
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> (TSN, p. 329, Hearing of August 14, 1984).</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span>, a prosecution's

motorcycle on the same road going westward towards <span class="SpellE">Claveria</span>,
he saw four persons quarreling at about a distance of 50 meters ahead of
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stopped to observe what was
going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span>
holding the right hand of Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pacis</span></span><span class="GramE"> from behind as Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, who was

Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pacis</span></span><span class="GramE">
five (5) times with a short firearm but missed.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> passed
by <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span> and when the three reached the place
where he (<span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span>) was, they stopped and warned
him not to reveal what he saw to anybody otherwise they will kill him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ordered him to leave immediately and so <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span> left hurriedly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the place where <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span> saw the four
grappling, he noticed a motorcycle, a fatigue cap, and a pair of colored
sunglasses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite passing by several
police checkpoints/stations in going to, and from, his place of destination, <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span> did not report what he witnessed (TSN, pp.

motorcycle of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, they were surprised that
there was no report of any accident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They returned to the place where they found the motorcycle to look for
Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pacis</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few hundred meters away was a trail leading

one of credibility of witnesses, the appellate court will not disturb the
findings of the trial court unless certain facts have been overlooked and if
considered might affect the result of the case (People v. <span class="SpellE">Abonada</span>,
G.R. No. 50041, January 27, 1989, 169 SCRA 530; People <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, G.R. No. 81520, February
21, 1989, 170 SCRA 497).</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span>
admitted that he did not immediately report the incident to the police
authorities because he was afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">But when asked by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Vinagrera</span> and Pat.</span>
<span class="GramE">de</span> la Cruz if he has knowledge of the incident, he
answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
brought to the police headquarters and later to the house of Atty. Rafael <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, one of the private prosecutors (Decision of the
trial court; pp. 8-9; Original Records, pp. 688-689) which is but proper, being
<span style="">a </span>witness for the prosecution and
does not necessarily imply that he was rehearsed before he gave his statement
to the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same manner, mere delay in reporting cannot reduce his
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court in many instances
has acknowledged the fact that people are naturally reluctant to get involved
in criminal prosecutions and has consistently refused to regard such delay as a
necessarily negative factor in the evaluation of his testimony (Rodriguez v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 177 SCRA 220-221 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the defense failed to prove that in testifying
against appellant, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span> was
motivated by ill motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence
of convincing evidence that the principal prosecution witness acted because of
improper motives, the presumption is that he <span style="">was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to</span> full faith
and credit (People v. <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>, G.R. No. 76893, February
27, 1989, 170 SCRA 681; People <span style="">vs. </span>Castillo,
G.R. No. 32864, March 8, 1989, 171 SCRA 30).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant‚Äôs insinuation that three (3) men could not have
attacked the victim because he was seen only with <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span>
before his <span class="GramE">death,</span> is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it was established that <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span> saw Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> with one passenger in his <span class="SpellE">motorcyle</span>
before his death, such circumstance is not incompatible with the fact that Pat.
<span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> was attacked by at least two (2) men, <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span> and appellant as found by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that the place where <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span> saw <span style="">Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> </span>with
his companion was different from the place where <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span>
saw Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pacis</span></span><span class="GramE"> being attacked by appellant, his son and <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant‚Äôs defense of
alibi is unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was positively
identified by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span>, </span>whose
credibility was not successfully assailed, as the one who stabbed Pat. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> while the right hand of the latter was being held by <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span> from behind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In case of positive identification, the defense of alibi must be proven
by clear <span style="">and </span>convincing evidence
(People vs. Alvarez, G.R. No. 70446, January 31, 1989, 169 SCRA 730).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant utterly failed to prove that he was
doing his job at <span class="SpellE">Taggat</span> Industries Inc. during the
commission of the <span style="">crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not even request his co-employees to
testify and confirm his presence thereat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defense of alibi merits outright </span>rejection when it could have
been corroborated by other persons and yet no such corroborating evidence was
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs.
Alvarez, <u>supra</u>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant‚Äôs claim that no evidence was adduced by the prosecution
to prove conspiracy between him and the other accused, Edwin <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span> deserves scant consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For conspiracy to exist, the evidence need not
establish the actual agreement which shows the preconceived plan, motive,
interest or purpose in the commission of the crime (Antonio v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 166 SCRA 595 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy is manifested in the coordinated
acts of the assailants (People v. <span class="SpellE">Tala</span>, 141 SCRA 240
[1986]) as shown in the case at bar where <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span> was
seen holding the hand of the victim while <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> was
stabbing the latter and <st1:city><st1:place>Arnold</st1:place></st1:city> kept
on delivering fist blows on the victim‚Äôs different parts of the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">When the victim was able to
escape, the <span style="">accused gave chase and <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span> shot the deceased five </span>(5) times although he
missed.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly the
malefactors acted in concert pursuant to the same objective; hence, the
presence of conspiracy (People v. <span class="SpellE">Maralit</span>, 165 SCRA
427 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the presence of
treachery or abuse of </span>superiority was not convincingly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For treachery to be appreciated, the culprits
must have employed means directly and specially tending to insure <span style="">the killing without risk to themselves and
that such means of execution was deliberately or consciously adopted (People v.
<span class="SpellE">Rellon</span>, 167 SCRA 75 [1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Marciales</span>, 166 SCRA 436 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim in the instant case was not
rendered totally helpless and defenseless because only his right hand was held
by </span>the <span style="">other accused while the
appellant stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim even
succeeded in freeing himself from his assailants and still managed to escape to
a distance of about </span>100 <span style="">meters
from the scene of </span>the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Palpallatoc</span> testified that there were
three (3) assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
participation of the other <span style="">accused,
Arnold <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, son of appellant, was not given
credence by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span>fact,
the trial court <span style="">acquitted him on
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it appears then
that only two persons took part in the </span>commission of the crime, the
appellant, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> and the other<span style=""> </span>accused Edwin <span class="SpellE">Bablis</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that there were two (2) male persons who attacked the
victim does not <u>per</u> <u>se</u> establish that the crime was committed
with abuse of superior strength there being no proof of the relative strength
of the aggressors and the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength
depends on the age, size and strength of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is considered whenever there is a
notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assessing
a superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor which is
selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission <span style="">of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To take </span>advantage
of superior <span style="">strength </span>means to
purposely use excessive force out of proportion to the means of the defense
available to the person attacked (People v. <span class="SpellE">Cabato</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-37400, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="4"><span class="GramE"><span style="">April </span>15,
 1988</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 160 SCRA 101).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution failed to prove that there
was indeed a notorious inequality between the ages, sizes and strength of the
antagonists and that these notorious advantages were purposely sought for or
used by the accused to achieve his ends.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly found that commission of the felony was
not attended by the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the accused-appellant and Edwin
<span class="SpellE">Bablis</span> were seen riding together on the <span class="SpellE">former‚Äôs</span> motorcycle does not by itself prove that they were
then determined to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
even appellant's remark, "<span class="SpellE">kursunado</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span>" (referring to the
victim) uttered to Cesar Domingo in the municipal hall when he <span style="">was </span>looking for the victim, constitute
a sufficient proof that it was during that time that he was determined to kill <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evident
premeditation cannot be considered to qualify <span style="">murder where it is not shown when the </span>plan to <span style="">kill was hatched, or what time elapsed before
it was carried out (People v. Corpus, 107 Phil. 44 [1960]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Acaya</span>, No. 72998, July </span><span style="">29, 1988, 163 SCRA 768).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the absence of any
qualifying circumstance, the crime </span>committ<span style="">ed is only </span>homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
p<span style="">enalty for homicide under </span>Article
249 of the Revised Penal Code <span style="">is </span><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>no mitigating and no aggravating
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the Indeterminate
Sentence Law, the accused-appellant is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty
ranging from twelve (12) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
as maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In line with the new policy of
this Court to grant an increased indemnity to the heirs of the deceased, the
award of P40,000.00 is hereby increased to P50,000.00 (People v. Daniel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, G.R. No. 86455, September 14, 1990).</p>
