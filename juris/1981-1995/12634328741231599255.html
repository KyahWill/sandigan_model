<p class="BODY">For purposes which will hereinafter be explained, we deem it
necessary to quote from the information, under which the appellants were
charged and tried, the particulars of how the felony was allegedly committed:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 2nd day of October, 1989 in the
Municipality of Marikina, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and
confederating together and mutually helping and aiding each other, with intent
to kill, evident premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously stab one Guillermo Abad y Botardo on the different
parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him multiple stab wounds which
directly caused his death."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The summary of the evidence for the prosecution,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
upon which the trial court based its finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt,
shows that at around 12:15 o'clock in the early morning of October 2, 1989,
Abad and his companions, Carlito Mitra and Edilberto Niegos, went out for an
evening of fun after a hard day's work.  They went to Jerez Restaurant located along Marcos Highway, corner
Tuazon Street, Marikina, Metro Manila.  There, they settled themselves <span style="">at
</span>a table in the second floor of the restaurant and ordered a round of
drinks for each of them.  Niegos then
called appellant Hatague, a waiter in the same restaurant, and asked the latter
if he could get a woman companion for them.  Hatague obliged and momentarily brought a female receptionist named
Millet to their table.  Millet drank
with the three (3) customers and even danced with them.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> After
a while, Millet excused herself and went downstairs.  She complained to the floor manager that her drink was sprinkled
with "vetsin" (monosodium glutamate) or ashes.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Niegos denied Millet's accusation and stated that they were
leaving, whereupon they hastily paid their bill and prepared to go.  Abad and Mitra went down to the first floor
ahead of Niegos.  Abad proceeded to the
comfort room and Mitra went in after him.  When Mitra came out, he saw Abad walking toward the front door of the
restaurant.  As Mitra approached the
same door, two men, later identified as appellants Hatague and Mirador, brushed
past him while rushing outside as if they were out to catch someone.  Mitra saw that the object of their chase was
Abad.  Mitra was not able to follow Abad
because Virgilio Masanque, the owner of the restaurant, blocked his way and
poked a gun at his head.  He saw from
the door that when appellants caught up with Abad, they hit him with a barrage
of blows which knocked him down.  Appellant Mirador repeatedly swung a two-feet long steel bar while
Hatague, who was armed with a pointed instrument, stabbed the victim several
times.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Still, Abad managed to get up and feebly tried to flee.  Mirador returned to the restaurant while
Hatague continued chasing Abad.  After
catching up with the victim, Hatague again stabbed him till he collapsed.  Hatague then walked back to the club.  The floor manager Benigno Albitos, met him
and asked whether he had stabbed the customer, to which Hatague replied in the
affirmative.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Meanwhile, the victim was aided and rushed by Niegos to the hospital where the
former expired shortly after his arrival.</p>

<p class="BODY">A postmortem examination, conducted by Dr. Dario L. Gajardo of
the PC/INP Crime Laboratory Services on the cadaver of the victim, shows that
he died of cardio-respiratory arrest due to shock and hemorrhage after
sustaining multiple blows on the head and legs and multiple stab wounds on
different vital parts of the body caused <span style="">by
</span>a <span style="">pointed instrument.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense contends,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> on
the other hand, that appellant Hatague arrived at Jerez Restaurant at about
midnight of October 2, 1989.  He first
rested in one of the rooms on the second floor of the club with Benigno
Albitos.  Shouts were heard from the
restaurant and Albitos went out of the room and approached a table where three
customers were being confronted by receptionist Millet.  Later, Hatague again heard shouts so he went
down to the ground floor and saw Benigno Albitos poking a gun at two customers.  Hatague further testified that a certain
Eric Albitos, a former waiter in the restaurant and brother of Benigno Albitos,
was chasing another customer whom he later identified as the victim, Guillermo
Abad.  Later, after the reported
stabbing incident, Benigno Albitos returned to the restaurant and instructed
everyone to tell investigators that the trouble happened between club
customers.  Hatague denied having
stabbed Abad.  During the investigation
by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Hatague claimed he could not do
anything when Benigno Albitos insisted on pointing to him as Abad's assailant.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, appellant Mirador allegedly reported for work at
Jerez Restaurant in the late evening of October 2, 1989.  He was attending to customers at the ground
floor when a commotion occurred at the second floor of the club and customers
from that floor rushed outside.  Benigno
Albitos ordered that the door of the club be closed and he did not allow
customers to go out.  Mirador was
unaware of what happened outside as he continued attending to customers.  He asserted that Benigno Albitos and Eric
Albitos were Abad's assailants as they were the ones who chased the customers
involved in the commotion.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Irineo Antazo, Jr., claiming that he was one of the companions of Abad,
corroborated Mirador's testimony and testified that Mirador continued attending
to the customers’ orders during the commotion outside the restaurant.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Cecilia Abad, widow of the victim Guillermo Abad, testified for
the defense and declared that she was informed by William Vista and Irineo
Antazo, Jr. that her husband was killed by Eric Albitos and Benigno
Albitos.  On October 16, 1989, she filed
a complaint with the NBI charging Eric Albitos for the killing of Guillermo
Abad.  However, during the investigation
wherein appellants Hatague and Mirador were being charged, she failed to inform
the fiscal that these two were supposedly not responsible for the
incident.  This was allegedly due to the
fact that her relatives advised her to go into hiding.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
No effort was made by her to pursue the case against Eric and Benigno Albitos
and it was only during the trial that she insisted on her accusations against
the Albitos brothers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, as found by the trial court, this witness admitted
that she executed an affidavit of desistance in favor of herein appellants because
of the pleas of the relatives of one of them and she further admitted that she
executed said affidavit not because these appellants are guiltless but because
she had forgiven them for causing the death of her husband.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This is reflected in the corres­ponding transcript of her testimony on this
point,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and betrays her unreliability as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, as earlier stated, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
found both appellants guilty as charged and rendered the assailed
judgment.  Feeling aggrieved with the
decision, appellants are now before this Court and contend that the trial court
erred <span style="">(a) </span>in giving full weight
and credit to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and in disregarding
the evidence for the defense, and (b) in convicting accused-appellants despite
the absence of evidence required to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the resolution of the issues raised by appellants
hinges on the credibility of the testimony of the prosecution and defense
witnesses.  In this regard, we are
constrained to once again reiterate the well-settled rule in our jurisdiction
that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are
accorded great weight and respect by the appellate courts in the absence of any
showing that the trial court has overlooked some substantial and material
facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Corollarily, the Court has also consistently ruled that
credibility is a matter that peculiarly falls within the province of the trial
judge who had first-hand opportunity to watch and observe the demeanor and
behavior of witnesses, both for the prosecution and the defense, at the time of
their testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find no cogent reason in the case at bar to deviate from the
aforestated rulings.  The findings of
the trial court are well supported by evidence, both testimonial and
documentary, adduced during the trial.  As further held by said court, neither does it appear that the
prosecution witnesses had any untoward motives or reasons to falsely testify
against appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the defense of appellants is anchored on denial and
alibi.  Alibi, according to settled
jurisprudence, is the weakest defense that can be availed of by the accused
because it can easily be manufactured and fabricated.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
For this defense to prosper and warrant acquittal, it is not enough that the
accused was somewhere else when the crime was committed but he must also be
able to demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to be at the
scene of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the rule to the case at bar, we find appellants' pretensions
to be unavailing.  Firstly, appellants
do not deny that they were in the very place where the killing occurred.  They merely denied their participation
therein.  Secondly, the appellants were
positively identified by the prosecution witnesses as the assailants of the
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Benigno Albitos, the floor manager of the
restaurant, testified:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  And will you please tell us what is that unusual incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  One of our customers, Sir, had a fight
with some of our waiters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  And do you know where they were fighting?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  After I went out, I already saw, Sir, that
they were chasing to (sic) each other to the direction of a corner street.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  Will you please tell us the person whom
they are (sic) chasing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  I do not know, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  And who were chasing at the time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  Peter Hatague and Orlie Mirador, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span style="">x </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  Why do you know the names of these two
accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  Because they were co-employees of mine,
Sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This testimony was corroborated by another prosecution witness, Carlito
Mitra, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  And what is the name of the person who stabbed Guillermo Abad?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A  The person who stabbed
Guillermo was Peter Hatague, Sir.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as earlier stated, witness Albitos established without
any refutation by the defense that appellant Hatague definitely admitted his
complicity in the alleged murder, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. TURIANO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  And after your conversation with Liza, what did you do, if any?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  I ran upstairs, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  While you were upstairs, what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  I immediately talked or informed Peter and
asked him, 'Peter, sinaksak mo nga ba ang customer?' Peter, did you really
stabbed (sic) the customer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  What was the answer of Peter Hatague?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  ‘Oo, kuya Boy.  Sobra na sila.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants Hatague and Mirador, in a last-ditch effort to absolve
themselves from liability, sought to ascribe the liability for the killing to
Eric and Benigno Albitos.  Withal, no
evidence whatsoever was adduced in their behalf to prove such imputation.  William Vista, the person alleged by the defense
to have seen the incident, was never presented as a witness.  On the other hand, the testimony of Irineo
Antazo, Jr., the person whom Cecilia Abad referred to as her husband's
companion, belies the theory espoused by the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the court below, Antazo did not make any averment in
his testimony that he was with Abad on the night that the latter was
killed.  It even appears that he does
not personally know the victim.  He
never testified that it was Eric or Benigno Albitos who killed Abad.  Moreover, he was not able to personally
witness the alleged incident because, as claimed by him, he was inside the
restaurant when the killing occurred.  He<b> </b>could not, therefore, have informed Abad's widow that Eric and
Benigno Albitos killed her husband.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also of significance are the admitted facts that appellant
Hatague remained silent when the killing was attributed to him and that, when
he was arrested, he was found to be in possession of a fan knife, which
admissions unsatisfactorily tried to explain away in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
it was Benigno Albitos who pointed to you as one of the persons who stabbed the
victim?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And despite being pointed to by Benigno
Albitos, you did not protest or make any action to prove that that is not true?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could not do anything about that matter,
sir, because you see when I was investigated at the NBI, he insisted and
pointed out to me as the person responsible for the crime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fact, do you agree with me that when you
were arrested by the NBI, a fan knife was also found in your possession?<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, they did find a fan knife in my
person yet that is not mine.  It was Boy
Albitos’, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, with respect to the fan knife which
was allegedly found in your possession, why is (sic) it found in your
possession?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That fan knife, sir, was given to me by
Albitos after the incident as a sort of a weapon for my self-protection."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not have to belabor the ridiculous explanation of said
appellant for his failure to protest or deny Albitos’ attribution to him of
such a grave felony.  We also agree with
the trial court that the excuse given by Hatague regarding his possession of
the knife was absurd because if he really knew that it was Eric and/or Benigno
Albitos who killed Abad, he would never have accepted it, knowing full well
that it could have been the very same knife used by them in stabbing the
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the alleged attendance of evident premeditation in the
crime, the trial court correctly ruled that the same was not sufficiently
proved by the prosecution.  No evidence
was adduced during the trial which shows the time when the offenders determined
to commit the crime, any act manifestly indicating that they clung to their
determination, and a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and
execution to allow them to reflect upon the consequences of their act.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also, this time contrary to the findings of the trial court, we
find that the killing of Abad was likewise not attended by treachery.  We have repeatedly ruled that treachery cannot
be presumed.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
The existence thereof must be as indubitably proved as the crime itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
To establish treachery against the accused, the prosecution must be able to
prove that, at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to
defend himself and that the offender consciously adopted the means, method or
form of attack employed by him.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite apparent that the prosecution failed to prove that
the victim was deprived of any means of defending himself.  True, the victim was unarmed when he was
attacked by appellants.  However, the
mere fact that he was unarmed cannot by itself adequately sustain a finding of
treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the records show that the victim was chased before he was
attacked.  He was even able to run for
another twenty-five (25) meters after the first stage of the felonious
assault.  It must also be recalled that
prior thereto, there was an altercation between the victim and appellants and
this could have placed the former on his guard.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, there is no showing that appellants
deliberately or consciously adopted the particular mode of aggression that they
employed against the victim in order to ensure the accomplishment of their
criminal purpose without any risk to themselves.  The killing was just a result of a casual encounter; the attack
was impulsively done; and appellants had no time to reflect on the method of
executing the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> It
cannot, therefore, be said that treachery was adopted and employed in the
commission of the felony.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But this pronouncement notwithstanding, we find that the
modifying circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength attended the
killing of Abad.  When it is shown that
the attack was not made with <u>alevosia</u>, the number of assailants and the
simultaneity of the attack upon a defenseless person may constitute abuse of
superior force.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, it is undeniable that, by reason of the synchronal attack on the victim
by two armed persons, the latter cooperated and intended to use or to secure
advantage from the superiority of their combined strength.  This is especially manifest where, as in
this case, the victim was unarmed and trying to flee, while the two felons were
armed and used their weapons in perpetrating the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, the abuse of superior strength, while constitutive
of a qualifying circumstance for murder,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a> was
not alleged in the information filed in this case, as we have made evident by
reproducing the indictment at the outset of this opinion, although such
circumstance was proved by the prosecution.  The rule is that qualifying circumstances must be pleaded and if not
pleaded but proved, the same shall be considered only as generic aggravating
circumstances.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the fact that herein appellants took advantage of their superior
strength shall only aggravate their liability for simple homicide to determine
the period of the penalty therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the respective liabilities of appellants, we find
that the court below correctly appre<span style="">c</span>iated
the existence of a conspiracy between them.  Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement
concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
To establish conspiracy, prior agreement between both accused to kill the
victim is not essential for the same may be inferred from their own acts
showing a joint purpose and design,<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
which was illustrated in this case by the concerted acts of appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence reveals that both appellants concurrently chased the
victim with physical assailment in mind.  Mirador was armed with a steel bar while Hatague had a pointed
instrument.  After catching up with
Abad, both of them inflicted blows on the latter.  The autopsy report shows, and the eyewitnesses testified, that
Mirador hit Abad with the steel bar on the upper portion of his leg while
Hatague was lethally using his knife on him.  While Mirador returned to the restaurant ahead of Hatague, this does not
affect or negate the findings of the trial court since the fatal wounds could
have been inflicted during the first or second attack.  At any rate, conspiracy having been proven,
the acts of each appellant shall be considered and appreciated against the
other.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, on the foregoing premises, the judgment
appealed from is ANNULLED and a new one is RENDERED finding accused-appellants
guilty of the crime of homicide with an aggravating circumstance of abuse of
superior strength, and imposing upon them an indeterminate sentence of ten (10)
years and one (1) day of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to seventeen
(17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
<span style="">as </span>maximum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants are also hereby ordered, jointly and
severally, to pay Miguela B. Abad, the mother of the victim, the amount of
P13,000.00 representing the funeral expenses incurred by her, to indemnify the
heirs of the victim in the increased amount of P50,000.00 in accordance with
current jurisprudence, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PADILLA, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the decision penned by Mr. Justice Regalado, except
that, in my view, the aggravating circums­tance of taking advantage of superior
strength should not be taken into consideration in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision states:   "x
x x we find that the modifying circumstance of taking advantage of superior
strength attended the killing of Abad.  When it is shown that the attack was not made with <u>alevosia</u>, the
number of assailants and the simultaneity of the attack upon a defenseless
person may constitute abuse of superior strength (citing U.S. vs. Lasada, 21
Phil. 287 [1912]; People vs. Cantre, 186 SCRA 76 [1990]).  Here, it is undeniable that, by reason of
the synchronal attack on the victim by two armed persons, the latter cooperated
and intended to use or to secure advantage from the superiority of their
combined strength.  This is especially
manifest where, as in this case, the victim was unarmed and trying to flee, <span style="">while </span>the two felons were armed and
used their weapons in perpetrating the crime (citing People vs. Bustos, 51
Phil. 385 [1928]; People vs. Diokno, 63 Phil. 601 [1936]; People vs. Verzo, et
al., 21 SCRA 1403 [1967]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>Bustos</u> and <u>Diokno</u> cases do not, in my view,
support the conclusion reached in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Bustos</u> case, the evidence adduced during the trial
conclusively established that in the afternoon of 24 October 1925 the accused
Francisco Bustos and Antonio Macaspac, on meeting Felipe del Castillo, son of
Angel del Castillo, with whom Francisco Bustos had just had a quarrel, and in
which Antonio Macaspac had intervened, the said accused pursued him; that
Felipe del Castillo threw a stone at his pursuers which hit Francisco Bustos,
thereby wounding him on the forehead; that the accused continued to pursue
their victim until they overtook him, then inflicting several wounds upon him,
as a result of which he died a few minutes later.  This Court held that --</p>

<blockquote>"In applying the penalty, no modifying circumstance of
criminal liability can be taken into consideration, because neither can the
fact that there were two aggressors be held to cons­titute abuse of superior
strength, since the relative physical strength of the aggressors and the
assaulted party does not appear of record; nor can the fact that the deceased
stoned Francisco Bustos be considered a provocation, since it does not clearly appear
that the deceased was provoked.  On the
contrary, it may be inferred from the <u>ante</u>-<u>mortem</u> declaration of
Felipe del Castillo that he took to stoning only upon being pursued by the
accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Diokno</u> case, the deceased Chinaman, who was
unarmed, was killed by his two assailants (father and son) who were armed with
knives, while the deceased was in a kneeling position, imploring forgiveness
from his assailants for having eloped with a woman who was daughter and sister
of the assailants, respectively.  The
Court held that -?</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  The
circumstance of abuse of superior strength, qualifying the crime of murder, has
not been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  In the case of United States vs. Devela (3 Phil. 625), this Court
said that ‘the mere fact that the number of the assailants is superior to that
of those attacked by them is not sufficient to constitute the aggravating
circumstance of abuse of superiority.’ In this case we have the photographs of
the body of the deceased x x x showing that he had strong constitution; but
there is no evidence of the physical constitution of the accused, Epifanio
Diokno and Roman Diokno.  Therefore, we
cannot determine whether or not said accused were physically stronger than the
deceased and whether or not they abused such superiority."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, in the <u>Verzo</u> case, this Court held
"x x x the facts proven leave no room for doubt that defendants herein
(Getulio Verzo and his two sons Reynaldo and Roberto) were united in their
purpose and in carrying out the same into execution.  Indeed, no other conclusion may be drawn from the circumstance
that they emerged from their house at the same time, each brandishing a bolo;
that they immediately attacked Benjamin Camino and chased him as he tried to
run away; that they did not desist, despite the shots of warning fired by
Patrolman Jariel and his words of advice; that when, after sustaining six (6)
wounds, Benjamin Camino managed to place himself beyond their reach, the
defendants proceeded to attack Filemon Casis; and that Reynaldo Verzo embraced
or held Filemon Casis from behind and then said:   ‘Go ahead, father stab him,’ which Getulio Verzo did.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, it appears that at the initial stage of the
attack, the appellants chased the deceased Guillermo Abad and when they caught
up with Abad, they (accused) hit him with a barrage of blows which knocked him
down.  Appellant Mirador repeatedly
swung a two-feet long steel bar while Hatague, who was armed with a pointed
instrument, stabbed the victim several times.  Thereafter, Mirador returned to the restaurant.  Meanwhile, the deceased managed to get up
and tried to flee but was chased by Hatague and after catching up with the
victim, stabbed him until he collapsed.  Then Hatague walked back to the club.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts show, to my mind, that the appellants herein
were NOT, beyond reasonable doubt, shown to be united in their purpose and in
carrying out the same into execution, as in the <u>Verzo</u> case.  Moreover, the relative strength of the
appellants and the deceased does not appear of record.</p>
