<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Solicitor
General, filed on August 22, 1979, a complaint for declaration of nullity of <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span> No. 6145, the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No.
23377 and all titles derived from said decree; and the declaration of the
parcel of land covered by the decree as belonging to the state, except so much
thereof as had been validly disposed of to third persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was amended on <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was docketed as Civil Case No. 34242 of

<p class="BODY">The defendants, herein private respondents, denied that <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span> No. 6145 and TCT No. 23377 were false and
spurious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They consistently claimed
(from the trial court up to this Court) that the parcel of land covered by the
questioned documents is a portion of the vast Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Angono</span>
owned by their predecessor-in-Â­interest, Don Buenaventura Guido y Sta. Ana;
that Don Buenaventura Guido left a portion of the hacienda (<span class="SpellE">porcion</span>
del <span class="SpellE">plano</span> 11-627) to his heirs, Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> Guido; that the subject matter of the petition
is only a portion of <span class="SpellE">plano</span> 11-627, consisting of an
area of 3,181.74 hectares and covered by <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span> No.
6145, issued on September 1, 1911 in the name of the heirs of Buenaventura
Guido y Sta. Ana (Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> Guido);
that on June 12, 1912, an Original Certificate of Title (OCT No. 633) was
issued on the basis of <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span> No. 6145; that the
original title was subsequently cancelled and in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate
of Title No. 23377 was issued on May 12, 1933; that the heirs of Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> Guido adjudicated among themselves the estate
left by their predecessors and transferred one-half portion thereof to Jose
Rojas sometime in 1942, as contained in an Extra-judicial Settlement of Estate
with Quitclaim dated December 17, 1973.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties, however, admit that on <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1974</st1:date>, the heirs of Buenaventura Guido,
represented by their lawyer, requested the then Land Registration Commission
(now Land Registration Authority) to issue the corresponding original
certificate of title based on <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span> 6145.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was denied on <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1976</st1:date>,
Alfredo Guido, representing the other heirs, filed a petition (Exhibit
"I-I"-1, p. 180, Records) for reconstitution of TCT No. 23377 with
the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Morong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition alleged that the original of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2337 could not be located in the files of the
Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> after he and his co-heirs
sought the registration of their Extra-judicial Settlement with Quitclaim dated
<st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was supported by the owner's
duplicate copy of the title.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for administrative reconstitution of TCT No. 23377
was granted and a reconstituted certificate of title [TCT (23377) RT-M-0002]
was issued dated <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the reconstitution, the heirs presented before the Registry
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Morong</span> the Extra-judicial Settlement of
Estate with Quitclaim which they executed on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1973</st1:date> in favor of Jose Rojas and which they
had earlier presented for registration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the entire parcel of land covered by the decree was
subdivided into twenty-one (21) lots and twenty-one <span style="">(21) </span>different certificates of titles were issued in lieu of the
reconstituted TCT No. 23377.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The named
heirs and now spouses Jose and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> Rojas sold the
property to <span class="SpellE">Pacil</span> Management Corporation and new
titles were issued in favor of the buyer on <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, on <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1976</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pacil</span> Management Corporation <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>
all the twenty one lots to the former owners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1978</st1:date>,
fourteen (14) of these twenty-one (21) lots were exchanged with shares of
stocks of <span class="SpellE">Interport</span> Resources Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="4">April
 21, 1980</st1:date>, all the named heirs renounced their rights over the
property in favor of their co-heir Alfredo Guido, Sr. in exchange for monetary
considerations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the only parties with existing interests in the
property subject of this case are <span class="SpellE">Interport</span> Resources
Corporation, the Heirs of Alfredo Guido, Sr. and spouses Jose Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> Rojas.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>qu</u><u><span style="">o</span></u><span style=""> </span>rendered judgment dismissing the complaint and declaring Decree
No. 6145 and TCT No. 23377, genuine and authentic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the decision states:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that Decree 6145 and TCT No. 23377 are genuine
and authentic, the decree cannot now be reopened or revived.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">âA decree of registration binds the lands (sic), quiets title

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, this case is hereby
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the counter claims
of the defendants are dismissed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the trial court was appealed by the Solicitor
General to the Court of Appeals which affirmed said decision on <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1988</st1:date> (pp. 149-154, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1988</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same motion, he
prayed for an alternative judgment declaring the decree and its derivative
titles authentic except with respect to such portions of the property which
were either:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) possessed and owned by <u>bona</u>
<u><span style="">fide</span></u><span style=""> </span>occupants who had already acquired
indefeasible titles thereto; or 2) possessed and owned by <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
occupants and their families with lengths of possession which amounted to
ownership (p. 224, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration was denied by the appellate court
in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="9">September 14,
 1988</st1:date>, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"After careful consideration of the motion for reconsideration
and defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' opposition thereto, we find
no cogent reason to justify the reversal of Our Decision dated July 12, 1988,
hence, the motion is DENIED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Likewise DENIED, is the alternative prayer to modify the
afore-mentioned Decision âto the extent that the recognition of the
authenticity of Decree No. 6145 and TCT No. 23371 shall not affect and
prejudice the parcels of <span style="">land </span>already
possessed and owned by <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span> occupants who have
already acquired indefeasible titles thereto,' for to grant <span style="">said </span>alternative prayer would <span style="">be </span>to run
roughshod over Our decision averred to." (p. 80, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">)<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This petition before <span style="">Us </span>was
filed on <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1988</st1:date>
with the same prayer for the declaration of nullity of <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span>
No. 6145 and TCT No. 23377 as in the complaint before the Regional Trial Court
and in the appeal before the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prayer for an alternative judgment first brought to the Court of
Appeals in the motion for reconsideration of its decision was also reiterated,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"In the alternative, judgment be rendered on equitable
grounds, modifying the aforesaid Decision dated July 12, 1988 of the respondent
Court of Appeals, that the recognition of the authenticity of Decree No. 6145
and TCT No. 23377 shall be valid only to the extent of the area of land in
question not possessed and owned by <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span>
occupants with indefeasible registered titles of ownership or with the length
of possession which has ripened to title of ownership thereto." (p. 54, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 19, 1989, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Interport</span>
Resources Corporation filed a manifestation that on May 15, 1989, it entered
into an Agreement with the Presidential Commission on Urban Poor (PCUP) for the
disposition of five hundred (500) hectares of the property involved in this
case for the use of deserving urban poor and to help the government in its
objective of alleviating the squatter problem in Metro Manila area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manifestation, it also stated
that <span class="SpellE">Interport</span> Resources had agreed to accept the
alternative prayer of petitioner (pp. 301-304, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
for private respondents Jose and <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> Rojas filed
a joint Comment (p. 324, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) manifesting no
objection to the granting of petitioner's alternative prayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The illegitimate heirs of private respondent
Alfredo Guido, Sr., represented <span style="">by </span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a>Atty. <span style="">Gilbert
M. <span class="SpellE">Fabella</span>, </span>filed a separate comment in which
they manifested that there is no legal basis for the recognition of any alleged
right of those occupants who were able to secure titles over portions of the
Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Angono</span> (pp. 571-574, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
other set of heirs of private respondent Alfredo Guido, Sr. conceded in their
comment, to a portion of petitioners' alternative prayer, that is, only insofar
as it would benefit those occupants in the property who obtained certificates
of titles to specific portions thereof (p. 428, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their joint memorandum (pp. 624-635, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">), </span>all of the private respondents
submitted that they had unanimously agreed to accept the alternative prayer of
the petitioner, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Since <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="12">December 4,

the petition, adopting <span class="SpellE">Interport's</span> Manifestation and
Motion under date of May <span style="">16, 1989 </span>and
praying likewise that judgment be rendered based on said Alternative
Prayer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, the petitioner alleged that respondent
appellate court committed serious errors and committed grave abuse of
discretion in rendering its decision more specifically:</p>

<blockquote>"a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in concluding and ruling that petitioner RP 'failed
to satisfy the requirements of preponderant proof in support of its theory'
when, on the contrary, it has satisfactorily adduced more than sufficient
evidentiary and conclusive proof, demonstrating convincingly that both
documents in question, purporting, respectively, to be a <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span>
No. 6145 and Transfer Certificate of Title No. 23377, covering a vast area of
land, so called "Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Angono</span>," located
in <span class="SpellE">Binangonan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, are
fake and spurious; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in denying and riding "roughshod" over
the alternative prayer in the Motion for Reconsideration (Annex "F")
to modify the main CA Decision (Annex "A"), despite the justifiably
legal and equitable grounds for respondent Court of Appeals to grant the same,
since there is evidentiary basis pointing to the alarming situation with
disastrous consequences, if and when the CA Decision (Annex "A")
would <span style="">be </span>arbitrarily and fully
implemented, by way of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>cadastral chaos,
multiplicity of suits and loss of public faith in the Torrens System as well as
the ensuing <span class="SpellE">grandscale</span> dispossession and social
displacement of several hundreds of <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span>
occupants and their families who had already secured indefeasible registered
titles to portions of the so-called Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Angono</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of petitioner that respondent Court of
Appeals committed serious errors in the assessment of the evidence on record
and acted with grave abuse of discretion in concluding that the Republic failed
to satisfy the requirements of preponderant proof in support of its theory.</p>

<p class="BODY">In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must
establish his case by a preponderance of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, the general rule in civil
c<span style="">ases </span>is that a party having the
burden of proof of an essential fact must produce a preponderance of evidence
thereon (I Moore on Facts, 4, cited in Vicente J. Francisco, The Revised Rules
of Court in the Philippines, Vol. VII, Part II, p. 542, 1973 Edition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By preponderance of evidence is meant simply
evidence which is of greater weight, or more convincing than that which is
offered in opposition to it (32 C.J.S., 1051).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The term 'preponderance of evidence' means the weight, credit and value
of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually considered to be
synonymous with the terms 'greater weight of evidence' or 'greater weight of
the credible evidence.' Preponderance of the evidence is a phrase which, in the
last analysis, means probability <span style="">of </span>the
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preponderance of the evidence
means evidence which <span style="">is </span>more
convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in
opposition thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (20 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., 1100-1101)</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of determining which party had the preponderant
evidence is within the province of the trial court before whom the evidence of
both parties are presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
of who to believe and who not to believe goes to the credibility of a witness
which, likewise, is within the province of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the facts and circumstances of the case must properly be
considered in determining the weight of evidence (20 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.,
1027).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In weighing the evidence of
witnesses, the trial court takes into consideration all the surrounding facts
and circumstances of the case on trial including the means of knowledge of the
witnesses, their true intentions, their seeming honesty or lack of it, their
respective opportunities for seeing and knowing the things about which they
testify, their conduct upon the witness stand, their manner of testifying, etc.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have carefully gone through
the records of this case and there is no reason for this Court to reverse the
decisions of both the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> and the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both courts were one in concluding that the
preponderance of evidence is in favor of the theory presented </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the private respondents, i.e., the authenticity of the questioned
documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's primary
witness was Francisco Cruz, Jr., </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">document examiner of the PC
Crime Laboratory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
summarized his testimony as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that as to Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 23377, the signature above the printed words Register of Deeds reveal
fundamental <span class="SpellE">divergencies</span> in that the questioned
signature was written on a slow and drawn manner, and no gradation of the ink
lines of the up and down stroke whereas the standard signatures are executed
with smooth and fluent manner, habitual speed, firmness of the strokes, and
show gradation of the ink lines; the questioned and standard signatures have
different <span style="">slants, different initial and
different </span>strokes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the
printing in the questioned and standards <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span>, they
have different printing characteristics, defects, spacing size and length.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regarding the red seal on the TCT, the
questioned seal is dark red in color, while the standards are bright red and on
exposure to ultra-violet lamp the questioned seal has ho fluorescence reaction
while the standards give red reactions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to the paper the surface of the questioned TCT has a deep brown
discoloration and did <span style="">not penetrate
inward indicative of artificial aging.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Regarding Decree No. 6145, Francisco Cruz, Jr. testified that as to
the signature and ink used are still intensely dark without the indication of
fading of color or oxidation and appear fresh while the ink used in the
standards are faded or discolored due to oxidation, the signatures in the
questioned and standard decrees have different shading, divergent strokes and
pen-lifts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the dry seal, the
borderline reeds of the questioned seal are sharp while in the standards they
are dull, there are 77 surrounding beads in the questioned seal while there are
97 in the standards, the distances between letters are different in the
questioned and standard documents indicating they were not impressed by one <span style="">and</span> the same machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the rubber stamp name, RALPH E. <span class="SpellE">McPIE</span>, the color of the ink in the questioned signature is
reddish while in the standards they are blue; they have different
characteristics indicating they were not from one and the same machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the rubber stamp Received,
the ink used in the questioned document is pink-red while the standards faded
violet, the rubber stamp have different characteristics, size and s[acing of

Questioned Documents Section of the NBI.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1975, even before the complaint for declaration of nullity of <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span> 6145 and TCT. No. 23377 was filed in court, he was
requested by the Land Registration Commission to examine and verify the
authenticity of Decree No. 6145.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo </span></u>summarized
his testimony as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
declared that the NBI received a request for examination of Decree 6145 from
the Land Registration Commission which was forwarded to him and after his
examination and investigation, he made a report, Questioned Document Report No.
476-675 dated August 22, 1975 approved by Ernesto G. <span class="SpellE">Brion</span>,
Chief <span class="SpellE">Criminalistics</span> Division and noted by Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Brion</span>, Deputy Director for Technical Services, NBI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that there are significant
similarities in handwriting characteristics existing between the questioned and
standard signatures RALPH E. <span class="SpellE">McPIE</span> in the decree such
as proportion <span style="">of </span>the base and
height alignment, made in fact and unconscious movement; lateral spacing;
consistent peculiar sight upward tendency of the signature; gradation of pen
pressure, presence of pen emphasis and tapering of lines; individual highly
developed letter designs; line quality; natural variation, <span class="SpellE">i</span>-dots,
periods and dash; and location of crossings of strokes and that there are no
significant dissimilarities in writing characteristics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are similarities in type face designs
existing between the <span class="SpellE">typewritings</span> appearing in the
questioned and standard documents indicating that the decrees were typed from
the same brand or kind of typewriter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, he testified the Decree 6145 shows natural brownish coloration
(<span class="SpellE">unartificially</span>) indicative of aged document similar
with the decrees executed in 1910, 1911 and 1912 on file in the vault section,
LRC, the figure in writing in "<span class="SpellE">Samp</span>
Receipt" in Decree 6145 shows general characteristics with those figures
in writing on Stamp Receipt in decrees executed in 1910, 1911 and 1912; the dry
seal disclose similarities in general characteristics and the stamped signature
in questioned decree and standard decrees have identical similarities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of all these findings, he
concluded that Decree No.6145 is genuine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also testified on the authenticity of the owner's duplicate of TCT
23377, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified further
that he likewise examined Transfer Certificate of Title No. 23377 and after a
comparative examination between TCT No. 23377 and various exemplars he found
that there are significant similarities in handwriting characteristics between
the questioned and exemplar signatures above the printed word "Register of
Deeds" indicating that the signatures were written by one and the same
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are significant
similarities in type printing impressions between the questioned typed printed
words and the corresponding exemplars indicating that the printed words in the
questioned TCT and different exemplars were impressed from the same printing
machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the dry seal impressions,
there are significant similarities between the questioned and exemplar dry seal
impressions, although the questioned dry seal appears darker while the
exemplars are lighter in color as variance in color is affected by different
conditions of storage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the
variance in color of the documents could be attributed to the different
conditions when the documents were kept in file.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these findings of the witness were
likewise explained by way of various charts and photo-enlargements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 152-153, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are confronted here
with varying testimonies of two expert witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, We agree with the court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u>
<span style="">and respondent appellate court in
giving more weight to the testimony of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagui</span> than to that of Mr. Francisco A. Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their respective educational and work
background speak of the differing levels of their qualifications and competence
to testify as expert witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Francisco Cruz, a Document Examiner of the PC Crime Laboratory, is a
BSBA graduate who had examined not less than 10,000 documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pagui</span>, on the
other hand, is the former Chief of the Questioned Document Section of the NBI
an LLB and B.S. Criminology graduate, and had examined about 50,000 questioned
documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
observed, and We note this fact, that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pagui</span>
testified in a straight-forward manner while Mr. Cruz wavered in answering some
pertinent questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also note from
the transcript of stenographic notes that <span class="SpellE">Pagui's</span>
answers to some technical <span class="SpellE">qustions</span> reveal his
authority as a document and handwriting witness, which cannot be said of
Francisco Cruz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pagui</span>
was first to render a report on these questioned documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 22, 1975, upon the request </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Land Registration Commission, he, then, Chief of the NBI,
Questioned Documents Section, conducted his investigation and submitted his
report finding these documents authentic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time he made the investigation, he was impartial and not
conscious of any impending case before the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four (4) years </span>later, in 1979, another
request for investigation, this time from the Office of the Solicitor General,
was received by the NBI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
disappointed and disgusted by the reaction of then NBI Director who pretended
not to have known about the existing NBI report on <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span>
6145.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, according to <span class="SpellE">Pagui</span> was one of the reasons for his early retirement from
the NBI (TSN, March 27, 1984, pp. 39-45).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On December 15, 1980, the NBI rendered another report (Exhibit
"M") finding <span class="SpellE">Decreto</span> No. 6145 not genuine,
signed by Segundo <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>, who was appointed NBI
Chief Document Examiner and Chief of the Questioned Documents Section after the
retirement of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pagui</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> was one of those who conformed with the previous
report of the NBI submitted by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pagui</span> in 1975 as
claimed by the latter and which was not contradicted by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also alleged that Decree No. 6145, solitary in its
hidden isolation and detached from the <span class="SpellE"><u>expediente</u></span>
of the land registration case, surfaced 64 years later under mysterious and
bizarre circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances surrounding the appearance of Decree 6145 was
far from mysterious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Racquel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Marfori</span>, a witness for the petitioner, who was then
Chief of the Ordinary Decree Section of the Division of Original Registration,
Land Registration Commission testified that her office' function is to receive
copies of decrees, certified copies of titles from the Registers of Deeds,
papers and documents from the Courts, the Bureau of Lands and other agencies
and keeps circulars and memoranda issued by the office and from the Department
of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further testified that
on September 4, 1954, then LRC Commissioner Antonio <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>
issued Circular No. 4, instructing <span style="">all </span>Registers
of Deeds to forward all copies of decrees in their possession for custody to
the LRC to complete the records of the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As appearing in the record book of inventory
in the LRC, among the decrees forwarded to their office is <span style="">Decree </span>6145
(TSN, October 26, 1982, pp. 54-55).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
likewise categorically stated that in the course of investigation of this case,
a copy of Decree 6145 was found in the vault section of the Commission (Ibid,
p. 66).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's witness Mr. Jose Cruz, testified that the alleged
GLRO number stated on the <span class="SpellE">decreto</span> pertains to a tract
of land owned by <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>
and not Buenaventura Guido; that said property was located in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and not in <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and that
TCT No. 25829 was issued in that case and not OCT 633 as alleged by the private
respondents, However, on cross-examination, he said that TCT No. 26829 of <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span> did not contain any decree number nor GLRO
number.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also admitted that indeed
Decree No. 6145 was issued on September 1, 1911 in GLR Record No. 2350.</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
your report Mr. Cruz appearing on page 2 thereof, I am quoting a portion of
your report appearing on page 2 thereof, second paragraph:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Alfredo Guido one of the <span style="">heirs </span>of <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span>
Guido, petitioned for the reconstitution of the original Transfer Certificate
of Title No. 23377 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and issuance of new original Transfer Certificate of Title, etc., etc.' and
furthermore, this is the portion that I am going to ask you of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'but upon verification it appears that the
original of said Transfer Certificate of Title No. 23377 bearing Book T-94,
Page 177 could not be located in the files of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.' Do you remember having stated that in your report
which I am showing to you?</blockquote>

sir, I cannot find the original Transfer Certificate of Title on file with the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>.</blockquote>

this statement of Mr. Guido in his petition for reconstitution is correct?</blockquote>

2350 was approved <span style="">on </span>August 26,
1977 and issued Decree No. 6145 on September 1, 1911 for a parcel of land
located in the province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, but the name of
owner, area and the municipality it is located was not mentioned.' And you
further stated and I quote:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It shows
that CLR Record No. 2350 was really issued Decree No. 6145 on September 1,
1911.' Do you affirm those statements you made?</blockquote>

other words, there was really such a decree issued on September 1, 1911?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact Mr. Cruz, in one of your annexes to Exhibit 'C' which is your report and
which has been marked in this proceedings as Exhibit 'C-7', it would appear
that there is such a Record 2350, correct?</blockquote>

the Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
sir.</blockquote>

there was a decree issued on August 26, 1906 as appearing in the column date
okay for decree, is that correct?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
it states in the last <span class="SpellE">colum</span> that the decree was
issued on September 1, 1911?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

the Decree No. 6145?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
it is equally true Mr. Cruz that Decree 6145 from your investigation was among
those old documents and decrees found in the Vault Section of the Land
Registration Commission, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
appears to be in the vault Section because Justice <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>
was the one who gave me that decree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
Justice <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> I suppose told you that it came from
the Vault Section of the Land Registration Commission that is why in your
report, the one in the Vault Section where salvage and issued Decrees are kept
shows that Decree No. 6145 was found in their files, is that correct?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the municipal treasurers and tax assessors

Government and all branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the
application or notice, the same being included in the general description
"To al whom it may concern".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, TCT No. 23377, having been found true and authentic
also possessed all the attributes of a <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
certificate of title. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>By express
provision of Section 47 of P.D 1529, no title to registered land in derogation
to that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To declare that the decree
and its derivative titles is valid but only with respect to the extent of the
area described in the decree not possessed by occupants with indefeasible
registered titles or to possessors with such lengths of possession which had
ripened to ownership is to undermine the people's faith in the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> titles being conclusive as to all matters contained
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate serves as
evidence of <span style="">an
indefeasible </span>title <span style="">to </span>the
property in favor of the person whose names appear therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the expiration of the one year period
from the issuance <span style="">of </span>the decree
of registration upon which it is based, it becomes incontrovertible (see case
of <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span> v. San Agustin, 43 Phil. 558; Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Nadres</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Borbon</span> and Director of
Lands, 50 Phil. 791, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sy</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Juco</span> v.
Francisco, O.G. p. 2186, April 15, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Brizuela</span> v.
de Vargas, 53 O.G. 2822, May 15, 1957), unless subsequent to the issuance of
the decree a third party may be able to show that he acquired title thereto by
any of the means recognized by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted however, that prior to the reconstruction of TCT
No. 23377 on March 29, 1976, [there was] no record in the Office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> show of the existence of
any registered title covering the land area subject of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court takes judicial notice of the fact
that prior to said date, certain portions of the area were in the possession of
occupants who successfully obtained certificates of titles over the area
occupied by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were also
occupants who had not obtained <span style="">c</span>ertificates
of titles over the area possessed by them but the lengths of their possession
were long enough to amount to ownership, had the land been in fact
unregistered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is admitted by
the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although prescription is unavailing against private respondents
because they are holders of a valid <span style="">c</span>ertificate
of title, the equitable presumption of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> may be
applied against them for failure to assert their ownership for such an
unreasonable length of time (only in 1976) against subsequent occupants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record showed that it was only <span style="">in </span>1974 when they tried to obtain an
original certificate of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
rebuffed by the LRC, they applied for a reconstitution of a TCT only in 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of Lola v. CA, G.R. No. LÂ­-46573, <span style="">Nov. </span>13, 1986, 145 SCRA 439, citing the
cases of <span class="SpellE">Pabalete</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>,
Jr., G.R. No. L-24357, 37 SCRA 518, 521, 522 quoting Mejia de Lucas v. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>, 100 Phil. 277, it was held that "although
the defense of prescription is unavailing to the petitioners (Pablo and Maxima
Lola) because, admittedly, the title to Lot <span style="">No. </span>5517 is still registered in the name of the respondent
(Dolores <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span>), still the petitioners <span style="">have acquired title to it by virtue of the
equitable principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> due to the respondent's
failure to assert her claim and ownership for thirty two (32) years."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, conscious of
the resulting "<span class="SpellE">largescale</span> dispossession and
social displacement of several hundreds of <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupants
and their families" which the Solicitor General pointed out, the private </span>respondents
agreed unanimously to accept the alternative prayer of the petitioner in their
joint memorandum (pp. 624-636, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This agreement by private respondents takes
the form of a waiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though a valid and
clear right over the property exists in <span style="">their
favors, they seemingly have voluntarily </span>abandoned the same favor
of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) those who possessed and actually
occupied specific portions and obtained <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
certificates of titles, and 2) those who possessed certain specific portions
for such lengths of time as to amount to full ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waiver, not being contrary to law,
morals, good customs and good <span style="">policy,
is valid and binding on the private respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, with respect to
the second set of possessors, whose alleged <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupancy
of specific portions of the property is not evidenced by </span>Torrens Titles,
it is imperative that their claims/occupancy be duly proven in an appropriate
proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. No. 12933 is AFFIRMED subject to the herein declared superior rights of
<u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupants with </span>registered titles within the area
covered by the questioned decree and <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupants therein
with lengths of possession which had ripened to ownership, the latter to be
determined in an appropriate proceeding.</p>
