alleged:</p>

<p class="2Q">"That on or before or after October 31, 1967, in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>,
Province of South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, Philippines, and within
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Tomas D. <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>,
being then the municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, and as such responsible for the improvement of
the municipality and to that end had to purchase or cause to be purchased the
needed materials; accused <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> de Vera who was duly
designated Acting Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>,
South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, and as such responsible and
accountable for all funds and properties belonging to the municipality by
reason of his position; accused Daniel Tobias, clerk of the Provincial
Auditor's Office and in charge of passing in audit all vouchers and allied
papers presented to him, conspiring confederating and mutually helping each
other, and taking advantage of their public positions, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously falsify a public document, namely: a
municipal voucher of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>,
South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, by causing it to appear therein that
200 reinforced concrete pipes of the size 18 inches in diameter by 100 meter
long, costing P6,000.00 and 93 reinforced concrete pipes of the size of 24
inches in diameter by 1.00 meter long, costing P4,092.00, or a total of
P10,692.00, Philippine Currency was delivered by the Fernandez Hollow Block
Factory to the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, and received by it, when in truth and in fact, as
all of them knew, only 10 reinforced concrete pipes of the <span style="">size </span>of 18 inches in diameter by 1.00
meter long costing P330.00 and 14 reinforced concrete pipes of the <span style="">size </span>of 24 inches in diameter by 1.00
meter long costing P946.00, Philippine Currency were delivered by the Fernandez
Hollow Block Factory and received by the said municipality, thus attributing to
the said Fernandez Hollow Block Factory acts or statements other than those in
fact made by it, and the said three accused, knowing the falsity of the voucher
<span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, conspiring, confederating and mutually
helping each other, and taking advantage of their public positions, did then
and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously cause the said false voucher to
be certified as true by accused <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> de Vera, in the
amount of P10,692.00 Philippine Currency out of the funds of the municipality
entrusted to his custody, and once paid <span style="">all

between the 293 concrete reinforced pipes referred in the false municipal voucher,
and the 24 concrete reinforced pipes costing P946.00 Philippine Currency, that
were actually delivered by the Fernandez Hollow Block Factory and duly paid for
to it, to the damage and prejudice of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>,
South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> and the Government in the amount of
P9,746.00, Philippine Currency which amount they failed to return despite

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing it is clear that petitioner, who was then the
municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, is charged with
conspiring with accused <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> de Vera, then Acting
Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> and as such an
accountable public officer, and Daniel Tobias, Clerk of the Provincial
Auditor's Office, in falsifying a municipal voucher of the municipality by
causing it to appear that 293 pieces of reinforced concrete pipes costing
P10,692.00 had been delivered by the Fernandez Hollow Block Factory (Fernandez
for short) to the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, when in
fact only a total of 24 pieces were delivered and received costing P946.00, and
that they appropriated the amount of P9,746.00 which is the cost of the 269
undelivered pieces to the damage and prejudice of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of facts of the appellate court are conclusive in
this proceeding, and it is on the basis thereof that this petition must be
resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A
careful </span>examination of the said findings of facts of the appellate court
and of the records of the case shows that the prosecution has not established
conspiracy between petitioner and the two other accused as to justify a
conclusion that petitioner is guilty of the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, certain circumstances demonstrate
not only the absence of such unity of action and purpose which is essential to
establish conspiracy but more especially, to establish the innocence of
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the flashfloods causing damage t<span style="">o </span>life and property in <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> in 1967, petitioner who was the municipal mayor,
called the municipal council to an emergency session in his residence to remedy
the impassable roads and serious problems of erosion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner summoned the municipal treasurer, <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matullano</span>, to the
meeting, but <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> de Vera who was acting in his
place attended the session.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
met him for the first time then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De Vera
was asked to discuss the financial condition of the <span style="">municipality as there </span>was a need to purchase 293 pieces of
culverts of different <span style="">sizes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>De Vera informed them that there was a
surplus of P27,000.00, thus, the council approved the budget in principle.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Although evidence was adduced tending
to show that only 24 culverts were delivered to the municipality, there is no
showing that petitioner knew of such fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, what appears is that what petitioner knew was that the 293
culverts requisitioned were delivered as shown by the supporting
documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the administrative
investigation and the preliminary investigation, petitioner asked that an
ocular inspection be conducted to verify the actual quantity of culverts
delivered not only at the back of the municipal building but also in the other
jobsites, but this was not heeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
during the trial, a similar representation of petitioner appears to have fallen
on deaf ears.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that petitioner had anything to do with the
alleged falsification much less that he profited from the effects of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold him liable with the
accountable public official for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> through
falsification of public documents, clear and convincing evidence of conspiracy
must be adduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, his
liability if at all shall be individual depending on his participation in the
commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately
no such evidence has been adduced to support his conviction even on this
account.</p>

<p class="BODY">What appears in this case is that petitioner as <span style="">a </span>public official acted in response to
a public need.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By so doing this
prosecution was set in motion by his political adversaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the slender evidence on record, his
vindication is in order.</p>
