accused Rolando Dural, also known as Ronnie Javelon and Bernardo Itucal, Jr. as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 31st day of January, 1988 at Caloocan
City, Metro-Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, conspiring together, confederating and mutually
aiding one another, without any justifiable cause and with intent to kill with
treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, did then and
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and employ personal
violence upon the persons of TSGT CARLOS PABON PC and CIC RENATO  MANGLIGOT PC, as duly appointed and
qualified members of the Philippine Constabulary, CAPCOM, Camp Bagong Diwa,
Bicutan, Taguig, while the latter were engaged in the performance of their
official duties, knowing the said TSGT CARLOS PABON PC and CIC RENATO MANGLIGOT
PC, to be agents of persons in authority by then and there shooting TSGT.
CARLOS PABON, PC and CIC RENATO MANGLIGOT PC, on the different parts of their
bodies, thereby inflicting upon the latter serious physical injuries, which
eventually caused their death.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. C-30112 and assigned

Pascual, Sgt. Douglas Tagapulot, Cpl. Angel Floranda, Guillermo Jaramilla,
Vicente Rosadiño, Pfc. Juanito Abella, Edwin Balag, Rener Ramos, Dennis Santos,
Erlinda Pabon and Erlinda Mangligot.  The parties agreed to dispense with the testimony of Dr. Desiderio

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution upon which the judgment of

italic">(sic) </span>Rener Ramos and Dennis Santos when presented to (sic) the
witness stand corroborated each other's testimony more specifically on material
points and testified that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'At about 12:00 in the afternoon of January 31, 1988 both of them
(prosecution witnesses Rener Ramos and Dennis Santos) were at the Macaneneng
Street in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City as they were supposed to go a (sic)
'tupadahan' however, they were not able to arrive at the tupadahan because
while on their way or from a distance of twelve (12) arms-length they heard
successive gunfires (sic) so they run (sic) and hid themselves in a concrete
fence near a store; from the place they were hiding or from a distance of ten
(10) arms-length they saw three (3) men each of them armed with .45 (sic)
pistol, firing upon at (sic) the two Capcom soldiers on board a Capcom mobile
car which was then on a full stop although its engine, was still running; two
of the gunmen positioned themselves beside each of the side of the mobile car
while the third gunman whom they identified as accused Rolando Dural otherwise
known as Ronnie Javelon (Dural for brevity) climbed the hood of the mobile car
and positioned himself in front of the car; after the two Capcom soldiers were
immobilized, the gunman standing near the driver's seat opened the left front
door of the car and got the .45 (sic) service pistol and armalite of the Capcom
soldiers; thereafter, the three gunmen left; during the shooting incident they
also noticed the presence of two persons, one was inside an owner jeep while
the other one whom they identified as accused Bernardo Itucal, Jr. (Itucal for
brevity) <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>standing near the
scene of the incident with one of his arm (sic) raised while one of his hand
(sic) <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>holding a .45 caliber
pistol; immediately after the three gunmen who fired at the Capcom soldiers
left; (sic) the man who was riding on the owner jeep told accused Itucal that
he was leaving and instructed Itucal to take care of everything; witness Dennis
Santos even quoted the very word (sic) of the man on board the owner jeep
'Pare, bahala ka na diyan'; after that, the accused Itucal walked away; two
days after the incident or on February 3, 1988 eyewitnesses Ramos and Santos
voluntarily went at (sic) the Capcom headquarters at Dagat-Dagatan, Caloocan
City to narrate what they have witnessed, consequently the investigator brought
them at (sic)  the Capcom headquarters
at Bicutan then at (sic) Camp Panopio Hospital; at the said hospital, they saw
one of the three gunmen (referring to accused Dural) who shot the two Capcom
soldiers; then they went back at (sic) Bicutan headquarters where they gave
their respective statements (Exhs. 'D' and 'E').'"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Both Itucal and Dural denied authorship of the crime charged and
interposed the defense of alibi.  The
former, a student of the Guzman Institute of Technology and a choir member of
the Muling Pagkabuhay Church located at Rosario Street, Bagong Barrio, Caloocan
City, claims that at about 12:00 noon of 31 January 1988, while he was eating
inside his house at 63 Rosario Street, Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City, he heard
gun reports and shouts and when he peeped through the window, he saw people
running or scampering away.  He and his
sister, Lorelie, wanted to go to nearby Macaneneng Street from where the gun
reports came, but they were not able to reach it because of the presence of
many onlookers at the scene of the shooting incident.  Before 12:00 noon or in the morning of 31 January 1988, he was at
the Chapel conversing with some people there.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Rolando Dural, <i>a.k.a.</i> Ronnie Javelon, who admitted
that his real name is Rolando Dural, testified thus:  that he stayed in his sister's house at Block 10, Lot 4, South
City Homes, Biñan, Laguna from 29 November 1987 up to 31 January 1988; two (2)
days before 1 February 1988, he told his sister, Agnes Javelon, that his
stomach and chest were aching and although he was suffering for quite a long
time, it was only on 1 February 1988 when he experienced severe pain; as a
consequence, his sister got in touch with Dr. Jeremias de la Cruz; the said
doctor first brought him to the latter's clinic in Quezon City where his cyst
was removed and his wound at the left side of his body was sutured; then he was
brought to the St. Agnes Hospital where he was admitted under the name Ronnie
Javelon for the reason that it was his sister who will be shouldering his
hospital bills and expenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected the defense of alibi on the ground that
eyewitnesses Rener Ramos and Dennis Santos, whose testimonies "were
logical, straightforward and probable", and whose "credibility was
not shaken in any manner by the rigorous examination to which they have been
exposed," positively identified the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In the first assigned error, appellants challenge the trial
court's finding that conspiracy existed among the accused, with Itucal acting
as the lookout.  They allege that the
evidence for the prosecution failed to establish that the appellants knew of
the criminal intent of their alleged two (2) unidentified companions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
maintains, however, that conspiracy was established by the presence of the
appellants and their companions at the scene of the crime and their
participation in the killing of the victims.  Witnesses Ramos and Santos testified that they saw Dural go atop the
hood of the CAPCOM car and fire a shot at one of the CAPCOM soldiers seated in
the front seat.  One Edwin Balag, a
witness for the prosecution and a neighbor of Itucal, testified that he had
witnessed the shooting of the CAPCOM soldiers and thereafter saw Itucal go atop
the hood of the CAPCOM car<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> and

<p class="BODY">A conspiracy exists when two (2) or more persons come to an
agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Direct proof is not essential to prove conspiracy; it may be shown by acts and
circumstances from which may be logically inferred the existence of a common
design among the accused to commit the crime charged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

It <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>sufficient that the

Confederacy was established beyond cavil in this case among appellant Rolando
Dural, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a.k.a. </i>Ronnie Javelon, and the
two (2) other gunmen.  Armed with deadly
weapons, they arrived together, each proceeding directly to a pre-assigned spot
from where they suddenly and unexpectedly shot their victims.  They then fled together toward the same
direction after divesting the victims of their firearms.  All these acts are eloquent proof of a
common plan and design deliberately and carefully executed with precision
through coordinated action.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt in Our minds as to the participation of
appellant Dural -- the evidence for the prosecution sufficiently established
his guilt with moral certainty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Itucal, however, deserves a different treatment.  The trial court held him liable as a
co-conspirator because of its finding that he acted as the <u>look-out</u> and
was armed with a .45 caliber pistol.  Our evaluation of the evidence yields no factual foundation for such a
finding.  It is based on claims,
bordering on speculation, of prosecution witnesses Rener Ramos and Dennis
Santos that from what they saw, Itucal <u>must</u> <u>have</u> <u>been</u> a
look-out.  They did not categorically
declare that Itucal was such.  They only
presumed or speculated that he was.  The
following is the testimony on direct examination of Rener Ramos:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  Now aside from the persons that you have mentioned firing at the

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Rener Ramos categorically admitted that it
was only when the three (3) gunmen had swiftly walked away toward Rosal Street
that he saw Itucal for the first time:</p>

<blockquote>Q  Away from the sight (sic) where the killing took place, isn't?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  Yes sir, they were turning their heads towards a street (sic) Rosal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  And it was at that point that you were saying that you saw Bernardo
Itucal standing with a 45 on his hand and very near the incident, isn't?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dennis Santos also admitted on cross-examination that he saw Itucal

<p class="BODY">If Itucal was the lookout, he had to come either ahead of or
simultaneously with the gunmen.  By the
very nature of his duty or task, a lookout should not come to the scene of the
crime after its consummation.  There is
absolutely no evidence that Itucal came ahead of or simultaneously with the
gunmen; on the contrary, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as shown </span>above,
he was seen for the first time only after the gunmen had walked away.  That he was armed which could have enhanced
the prosecution's theory that he was a co?conspirator, was not likewise
sufficiently proven.  While Rener Ramos
testified that he was, his companion, Dennis Santos, who similarly focused his
eyes on Itucal and the others and witnessed almost everything that took place,
did not notice any weapon in Itucal's possession.  According to Rener Ramos, Itucal "had his arm raised and one
of his hand (sic) was holding a 45 caliber pistol." If such were indeed
the fact, Dennis Santos would not have failed to see it.  That is not all to it.  Another prosecution witness, Edwin Balag --
who even testified that he had seen Itucal, his neighbor whom he had known for
more than two (2) years,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>

The prosecuting Fiscal did not attempt to extract any information or testimony
to that effect from him.  It was the
court which asked the appropriate question after the re-direct examination of
Balag, but the witness categorically admitted that Itucal was not armed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">at </span>that time, thus:</p>

that he was a co-conspirator in the absence of any evidence, as in this case,
that he was a member of a subversive organization which operates the sparrow
unit and that the driver of the owner-type jeep was also a co-conspirator.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that
he was a sympathizer of such a subversive organization, mere sympathy is not
enough to prove his participation in the conspiracy.  The parting statement of the driver of the owner-type jeep could
be addressed to anybody at the scene and is susceptible of two (2)
interpretations, one of which is inconsistent with the participation of Itucal
either in the planning of the crime or in the execution of such plan.  In the light of the presumption of innocence
guaranteed by the Constitution, and in the absence of credible inculpatory
evidence, that interpretation in his favor must prevail.  While admittedly the alibi of Itucal is
weak, the evidence of the prosecution against him <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">is </span>likewise feeble.  The
prosecution cannot use the weakness of Itucal's defense to enhance its case; it
must rely on the strength of its own evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> And considering
that Itucal's culpability could only be anchored on his participation in a
conspiracy, such participation must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence.  The prosecution has failed to
successfully discharge that burden in this case, leaving this Court
unconvinced, due to reasonable doubt, of the guilt of Itucal.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing exposition, resolution of the second and third
assigned errors is no longer necessary.  However, for the satisfaction of accused Dural, let it be stated that
the alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as
to whether there was a basketball game going on at the time the first gunfire
was heard, who among the appellants climbed atop the hood of the CAPCOM car,
and which of two (2) written statements of Ramos and Santos were first made,
refer to trivial or minor points.  Settled <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>the rule that
discrepancies on minor matters do not impair the essential integrity of the
prosecution's evidence as a whole or reflect on the witnesses' honesty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, there is at all no inconsistency in the testimonies of the
witnesses on the second issue.  As
correctly pointed out by the People, both appellants did in fact climb atop the
hood.  According to Ramos and Santos,
Dural did so and fired at one of the soldiers seated in the front seat of the
car.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
According to Balag, Itucal climbed atop the hood only after the three (3)
gunmen had fired at their victims.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to alibi, it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>fundamental
juridical dictum that it cannot prevail over the positive identification of the
accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">case, </span>Dural was
positively identified by the principal witnesses for the prosecution.  It is equally settled that for alibi to
prosper, it must not only be shown that the accused was at some other place at
the time of the incident but that it was physically impossible for him to have
been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
This was not proven by Dural.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth assigned error is without merit.  It is too late for the appellants to
question the illegality of their arrests.  The irregularity, if any, was cured when they submitted themselves to
the jurisdiction of the trial court by filing a petition for bail,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">32</span></span></a> entering a plea of not guilty and actively
participating at the pre-trial and trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there merit in the fifth assigned error.  Per the testimonies of Rener Ramos and
Dennis Santos, the victims who had no opportunity to defend themselves as they
were still inside the CAPCOM car which was still maneuvering, were shot at close
range immediately after the three (3) gunmen, one of whom is appellant Dural,
surrounded the car with each positioning himself, at pre-assigned spots, <i>i.e.</i>,
the left, right and front portions <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>the
car.  The autopsy reports<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">33</span></span></a> showed that both victims sustained gunshot wounds
mostly in the head.  The suddenness of
the attack on the unwary victims and the simultaneous and coordinated gunfire
trained at them insured the execution of the deed without risk to the gunmen
arising from any defense which the victims might make.  Treachery then attended the commission of
the deed.  The killing of the two (2)
CAPCOM soldiers was thus qualified to murder under Article 248 of the Revised
Penal Code.  There is treachery when the
offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means,
methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and especially
to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which
the offended party might make.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">34</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt in Our minds that appellant Dural and the two
(2) other gunmen knew that the victims, T/Sgt. Carlos Pabon and C1C Renato
Mangligot, were members of the Philippine Constabulary detailed with the CAPCOM
as they were then in uniform and riding an official CAPCOM car.  The victims, who were agents of persons in
authority, were in the performance of official duty as peace officers and law
enforcers.  For having assaulted and
killed the said <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">victims, </span>in
conspiracy with the other two (2) gunmen, appellant Dural also committed direct
assault under Article 148 of the Revised Penal Code.  The crimes he committed, therefore, are two (2) complex crimes of
murder with direct assault upon an agent of a person in authority.  Pursuant then to Article 48 of the Revised
Penal Code, the maximum of the penalty for the more serious crime, which is
murder, should be imposed.  The maximum
of the penalty prescribed for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal
Code <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>death, but in view of
the prohibition on the imposition of the death penalty,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

italic"> </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">perpetua</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.  </span>The
trial court correctly imposed on appellant Dural two (2) penalties of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">reclusion</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">perpetua</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.  </span>In
