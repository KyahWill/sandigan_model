rendered on December 11, 1973, insofar as the Motion for Reconsideration of
respondent Republic of the Philippines (REPUBLIC, for short) was concerned, by
setting aside the Order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch XVIII, dismissing <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span> appeal for late filing of its Record on Appeal,

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top:15.0pt"><span class="GramE">In Civil Case No.</span>
Q-8095, petitioner, as plaintiff, sought to recover from the REPUBLIC and
Juliana M. <span class="SpellE">Maronilla</span> and Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Maronilla</span>
(SPOUSES, for short), the amount of P2,540,000.00 as his commission in selling
"Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span>" situated at <span class="SpellE">Jala-Jala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and owned by
the SPOUSES, to the REPUBLIC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that the SPOUSES had given petitioner a 60-day option to sell the
"hacienda" for a net price of P1,100,000.00 with the understanding
that any overprice would be petitioner's commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1963</st1:date>,
within the renewed option period until <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8">August
 8, 1963</st1:date>, petitioner succeeded in negotiating with the REPUBLIC,
through the Land Tenure Administration, a Deed of Absolute Sale and Donation by
the SPOUSES of the "hacienda" at the total price of P3<span class="GramE">,640,000.00</span>, one-half of which was payable in cash and the
other half in negotiable land certificates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Payment was to be effected upon receipt by the REPUBLIC of a
certification by the proper Court that the civil case involving ownership of
the property had been settled, and upon the execution, perfection and
registration of the instrument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
upon petitioner's claim that he had earned his commission that he filed the Complaint
below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Initially the REPUBLIC denied under oath the genuineness and due
execution of the Deed of Sale and Donation alleging that the same was void for
not having been duly approved by the Land Tenure Administration Board and for
having been entered into without a previous certification of availability of
funds from the Auditor General as required by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the Land Tenure Administration was abolished by
Republic Act 3844 and all its assets, powers and functions were taken over by
the Land Authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">For their part, the SPOUSES contended that petitioner had failed
to consummate the sale as he did not obtain the purchase price from the
REPUBLIC within the stipulated period so that he was not entitled to any
commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 3, 1970, the REPUBLIC, to the end that the land reform
program could be implemented, filed a Motion and/or Manifestation, reversing
its position, waiving the defects of the Deed of Sale and Donation and
ratifying the contract as of its date of execution on August 7, 1963, subject
to the condition that petitioner would waive his claim for damages in the sum
of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and attorney's fees of P100,000.00,
which petitioner did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Trial Court
eventually construed said <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span> manifestation as
a confession of judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The SPOUSES moved to strike out the <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span>
Motion and Manifestation, which the Trial Court initially granted, but
thereafter deferred resolution of the reconsideration sought by REPUBLIC until
after trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1972</st1:date>,
the Trial Court rendered judgment, with the following <span class="SpellE">decretal</span>

<p class="BODY">The REPUBLIC moved to reconsider and set aside certain aspects of
the Decision for not being part of the confession judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also sought reconsideration on the
ground that the purchase price had to be readjusted due to a de facto
devaluation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner thereafter moved

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1972</st1:date>,
the SPOUSES filed their notice of appeal and appeal bond, and on <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1972</st1:date>, their Record on
Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>REPUBLIC opposed the Record on
the ground that it did not include certain pleadings that it had filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 25, 1972, the Trial Court issued an Order requiring the
amendment of the SPOUSES' Record on Appeal; denying the motion for readjustment
of the purchase price filed by petitioner; denying the <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span>
Motion for Reconsideration; and, acting on petitioner's supplemental Motion for
partial execution on the ground that the Decision had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, ordered the REPUBLIC to make a judicial
consignation, within two months from notice, of the amount of P2,540,000.00
corresponding to petitioner's share, payable one-half in cash, and one-half in
negotiable land certificates.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1972</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Supplemental Complaint praying for a revaluation of the

the objection of the REPUBLIC and the SPOUSES.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1972</st1:date>,
REPUBLIC filed a notice of appeal from the Trial Court Decision of <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1972</st1:date> as well as from the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1972</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss <span class="SpellE">REFUBLIC's</span>
Appeal on the ground that the Decision as well as the Order of <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1972</st1:date> <span class="GramE">were</span>
not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> inasmuch as the Manifestation and Motion
filed by the REPUBLIC on <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1970</st1:date>
partook of the nature of confession of judgment so that the judgment had become
final.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1972</st1:date>,
REPUBLIC sought another extension of 30 days from <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1972</st1:date> within which to file its Record on

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1972</st1:date>,

granting partial execution of the Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 24, 1972, REPUBLIC further manifested that
Presidential Decree No. 2 proclaiming the entire country as a land reform area,
and Presidential Decree No. 27 decreeing the emancipation of the tenants from
the bondage of the soil, were applicable to the case and prayed for the
suspension of the proceedings to await the promulgation of rules implementing
P.D. No. 27.</p>

<p class="BODY">In conjunction therewith, REPUBLIC, on <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1972</st1:date>, filed a Motion for suspension
of the running of the period to file its Record on Appeal until the Trial Court
resolved its <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1972</st1:date>
Motion to suspend proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="BODY">We reject those contentions upon the pertinent data recapitulated
below:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1972</st1:date>,
REPUBLIC filed its Notice of Appeal from the Trial Court Decision of <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1972</st1:date> and Order of <st1:date year="1973" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1972</st1:date>,
REPUBLIC moved for extension of 30 days from <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1972</st1:date> within which to file its Record on Appeal,
or in the alternative, until such time as the SPOUSES' Record on Appeal is
approved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Motion was granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon another request for extension, REPUBLIC
was granted up to <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1972</st1:date>
within which to file its Record on Appeal, or in the alternative, to file it at
any time after the approval of the Record on Appeal of the SPOUSES but in no
case more than fifteen (15) days after said approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, REPUBLIC filed on <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1972</st1:date> a Motion for suspension of proceedings
in view of the promulgation of P.D. Nos. 2 and 27, allegedly applicable to the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1972</st1:date>, REPUBLIC filed a Motion to suspend the
running of the period to file its Record on Appeal until the Court resolved its
Motion suspend proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1972</st1:date>, the Trial Court
granted the Motion to suspend the running of the period to file <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span> Record on Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On December 27, 1972, the Court issued two
(2) Orders, one, denying <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span> Motion to suspend
proceedings and, two, a Supplemental Decision, with a warning to all parties to
perfect their appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period
counted from receipt of the Supplemental Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the warning was intended to amend and supersede all
previous Orders regarding the perfection of the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, since the REPUBLIC received on <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1973</st1:date> a copy each of the Orders dated <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1972</st1:date>, it would have had
until <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1973</st1:date>
within which to submit its Record on Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1973</st1:date>,
it filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Order denying suspension of
proceedings which was denied by the Trial Court on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>REPUBLIC received copy of said Order on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>REPUBLIC then filed its Record on Appeal on <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As respondent Appellate Court had found:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Republic's record on appeal, which it filed on March 23, 1973, was well within
the period granted it to perfect its appeal considering that the order of
December 27, 1972 giving Republic thirty (30) days within which to perfect its
appeal was received by it on January 5, 1973; it then filed a motion for
reconsideration of said order on January 10, 1973 and copy of the order denying
said motion for reconsideration was received by it on March 16, 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It thus appears that the Republic has
consumed only twelve (12) days of the thirty (30) days granted it to perfect
its appeal."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioner's contention, <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span>
Motion for Reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January
 10, 1973</st1:date> was not <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>, even if we were to
concede that it was a reiteration of its previous Motion for suspension of the
proceedings.</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Among the ends to which a motion for reconsideration is addressed, one is
precisely to convince the court that its ruling is erroneous and improper,
contrary to the law or the evidence (Rule 37, Section 1, subsection [c]); and
in doing so, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> has to dwell of necessity
upon the issues passed upon by the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If a motion for reconsideration may not discuss these issues, the consequence
would be that after a decision is rendered, the losing party would confined to
filing only motions for reopening and new trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find in the Rules of Court no warrant for
ruling to that effect, a ruling that would, in effect eliminate subsection (c)
of Section 1 of Rule 37".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is also worth noting that the said Motion for Reconsideration
specifically pointed out the erroneous conclusions of fact and law upon which
the two subject orders of the Trial Court were based, and explained in detail
why they were so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This circumstance further refutes petitioner's contention that said Motion for
Reconsideration was <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>.</p>

<blockquote>"The motion for reconsideration of herein petitioner, while
substantially based on the same grounds he invoked in his memorandum after the
case was submitted for decision, is not <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> as it points
out specifically the findings or conclusions in the judgment which he claims
are not supported by the evidence or which are contrary to law"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>,
aside from stating additional specific reasons for the said grounds".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion follows that not being <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>, <span class="SpellE">REPUBLIC's</span> Motion for Reconsideration, dated <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1973</st1:date>, suspended the
running of the period within which to file its Record on Appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is another consideration equally as compelling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The merits of the intended appeal persuade us
to give REPUBLIC a chance to seek a review by an Appellate Court of the
judgment adversely affecting its interests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the language of then Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals,
Guillermo S. Santos:</p>

<blockquote>"In the second place, the case which involves a substantial
amount, over three (3) million pesos, raises several transcendental issues of
fact and law or of law alone, which can only be resolved on their merits by an
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would thus not only be unwise
but also unfair to foreclose Republic's recourse to an appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, and this is a matter of
record, that the Republic -- and this can be said of the <span class="SpellE">Maronillas</span>
-- has seasonably taken steps to appeal them the filing of their notice of
appeal and appeal bond, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Maronilla</span>,
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period -- and the only issue
is whether the <span class="SpellE">Maronillas</span> and Republic filed their records
on appeal within the extension granted them or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the principle of a balancing of interests
between two competing alternatives, it would seem that it would be better to
afford Republic the opportunity to appeal and to settle once and for all the
issues it desires to raise -- i.e., <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
whether or not the case has become academic in the light of the Presidential
Decrees, and whether or not the amicable settlement is legal and could have
been approved as a basis for judgment, or not -- in this instance."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the principle of "balancing of
interests", its invocation is not really out of place considering that it
is always incumbent upon the Judiciary to undertake the process of
harmonization and balancing. </p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is
