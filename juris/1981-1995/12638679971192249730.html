				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for clarification with prayer for preliminary
injunction filed by Filipinas Port Services, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>) seeking to clarify two conflicting decisions
rendered by this Court in cases involving identical or similar parties, facts
and issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the government policy which ordained that cargo
handling operations should be limited to only one cargo handling
operator-contractor for every port (under Customs Memorandum Order 28075, later
on superseded by General Ports Regulations of the Philippine Ports Authority)
the different stevedoring and <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> corporations
operating in the Port of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> were integrated into a
single <span class="SpellE">dockhandlers</span> corporation, known as the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Dockhandlers</span>, Inc., which
was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 13, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the late receipt of its permit to operate at the Port of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> from the Bureau of Customs, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dockhandlers</span>, Inc., which was subsequently renamed <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>, actually started its operation on February 16,
1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the merger, Section 118, Article X of the General
Guidelines on The Integration of Stevedoring/<span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Services (PPA Administrative Order No. 13-77) mandated <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>
to draw its personnel complements from the merging operators, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 118.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absorption of labor<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Subject to the provisions of the immediate
preceding section, and <u>consistent</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>actual</u> <u>operational</u>
<u>requirements</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>new</u> <u>management</u>, <u>all</u>
<u>labor</u> <u>force</u> <u>together</u> <u>with</u> <u>its</u> <u>necessary</u>
<u>personnel</u> <u>complement</u>, <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>merging</u> <u>operators</u>
<u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>absorbed</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>merged</u> <u>or</u>
<u>integrated</u> <u>organization</u> <u>to</u> <u>constitute</u> <u>its</u> <u>labor</u>
<u>force</u>." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span class="SpellE">Filport's</span> labor force was mostly
taken from the integrating corporations, among them the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 4, 1987, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liboon</span> and 18 others filed a complaint with the
Department of Labor and Employment Regional Office in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City, alleging that they were employees of <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>
since 1955 through 1958 up to December 31, 1986 when they retired; that they
were paid retirement benefits computed from February 16, 1977 up to December
31, 1986 only; and that taking into consideration their continuous length of
service, they are entitled to be paid retirement benefits differentials from
the time they started working with the predecessors of <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>
up to the time they were absorbed by the latter in 1977 (p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding <span class="SpellE">Filport</span> a mere alter ego of the
different integrating corporations, the Labor Arbiter held <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>
liable for retirement benefits due private respondents for services rendered
prior to <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision was affirmed by the NLRC on
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Filport</span> filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with the Supreme Court docketed as G.R. No. 85704, claiming that it is an
entirely new corporation with a separate juridical personality from the
integrating corporations; and that <span class="SpellE">Filport</span> is not a
successor?employer, liable for the obligations of private respondents'
previous employers, as shown clearly in<span style=""> </span>the
memorandum dated November 21, 1978 of PPA Assistant General Manager <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, Jr., to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">While G.R. No. 85704 w<span style="">as </span>still

another employee of <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>, instituted a suit

(one of the defunct stevedoring firms) claiming for retirement benefits for
services rendered prior to <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="2">February
 19, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The labor arbiter
found for <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> Silva and said decision was
affirmed by the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Filport</span> filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with the Supreme Court docketed as G.R. No. 86026.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1989</st1:date>, this Court, through the First Division, rendered a
decision, holding that:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Filport</span>) cannot <span style="">be held </span>liable for the payment of the
retirem<span style="">ent</span> pay of private
respondent (<span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> Silva) while in the employ of

and cannot be passed on to the petitioner." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 7)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In so ruling, the First Division relied heavily on the case of
Fernando v. <span class="SpellE">Angat</span> Labor Union <span style="">(5 </span>SCRA 248) where it was held that unless expressly assumed<span style="">, </span>labor contracts are not enforceable
against <span style="">a </span>transferee of an

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1990</st1:date>,
however, this Court, through the Second <span style="">Division,
dismissed </span>the petition in G.R. No. 85704 "for failure to
sufficiently show that the questioned judgment is tainted with grave abuse of
discretion."</p>

<p class="BODY">Per entry <span style="">of judgment,
said resolution became </span>final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1990</st1:date> (p. 108, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition for clarification with prayer for
preliminary injunction <span style="">to </span>enjoin
the respondents from enforcing the decision in G.R. No. 85704 until further
orders of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no reason to disturb the findings of fact of the public
respondent, supported as they are by substantial evidence in the light of the
well established principle that findings of administrative agencies which have
acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters
are generally accorded not only respect but at times even finality, and that
judicial review by this Court on labor cases does not go so far as to evaluate
the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC based
their determinations but are limited to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse
of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(National Federation of
Labor Union v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>, 143 SCRA 129).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case filed by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liboon</span> et al against <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>,
the findings of the NLRC in its <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1987</st1:date> decision are categorical:</p>

<blockquote>"In resolving the issues, the Labor Arbiter concludes as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The eventual incorporation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>/stevedoring
firms and their subsequent registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1975</st1:date>
brought to the fore the interlocking ownership of the new corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequent amendment of its Articles of Incorporation
highlighted by the renaming of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Dockhandlers</span>, Inc. to Filipinas Port Services, Inc. did not
diminish the fact that the ownership and constituency of the new <span style="">co</span>rporation are basically identical
with the previous owners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is, therefore, the considered view of this Office that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Filport</span> being a mere alter ego of the
different merging companies has at the very least, the obligation not only to
absorb into its employ worke<span style="">r</span>s
of the dissolved companies, but also to absorb the length of service earned by
the absorbed employees from their former employers.</blockquote>

SCRA 465).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 35 &amp; 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Said findings were reiterated in the case filed by <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> Silva against <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>
where the NLRC, in its decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="1">January
 19, 1988</st1:date>, further ruled that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As We have ruled in the
similar case involving herein appellant, the latter is deemed a survivor entity
because it continued in an essentially unchanged manner the business operators
of the predecessor <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and port service
operators, hiring substantially the same workers, including herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, of the <span class="SpellE">integree</span>
predecessors, using substantially the same facilities, with similar working
conditions and line of business, and employing the same corporate control,
although under a new management and corporate personality." (G.R. No.
86026, p. 35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, granting that <span class="SpellE">Filport</span> had no
contract whatsoever with the private respondents regarding the services
rendered by them prior to <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="2">February 16,
 1977</st1:date>, by the fact of the merger, a succession of employment rights
and obligations had occurred between <span class="SpellE">Filport</span> and the
private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law enforced at
the time of the merger was Section 3 of Act No. 2772 which took effect on <st1:date year="1918" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1918</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said law provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the perfecting, as aforesaid, of a
consolidation made in the manner herein provided, the several corporations
parties thereto shall be deemed and taken as one corporation, upon the terms
and conditions set forth in said agreement; or, upon the perfecting of a
merger, the corporation merged shall be deemed and taken as absorbed by the
other corporation and incorporated in it; and all and singular rights,
privileges, and franchises of each of said corporations, and all property, real
and personal, and all debts due on whatever account, belonging to each of such
corporations, shall be taken and deemed as transferred to and vested in the new
corporation formed by the consolidation, or in the surviving corporation in
case of merger, without further act or deed; and the title to real estate,
either by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the Philippine Islands vested in
either corporation, shall not be deemed in any way impaired by reason of this
Act:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That the rights
of creditors and all liens upon the property of either of said corporations
shall be preserved unimpaired; and all debts, liabilities, and duties of said
corporations shall thenceforth attach to the new corporation in case of a
consolidation, or to the surviving corporation in case of a merger, and be
enforced against said new corporation or surviving corporation as if said
debts, liabilities, and duties had been incurred or contracted by it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, it was mandated that <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>
shall absorb all labor force and necessary personnel complement of the merging
operators, thus, clearly indicating the intention to continue the
employer-employee relationships of the individual companies with its employees
through <span class="SpellE">Filport</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged memorandum of the PPA Assistant General exonerating <span class="SpellE">Filport</span> from any liability arising from and as a result of
the merger is contrary to public policy and is <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the workers' right to security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said memorandum was issued in response to a query of the PMU
Officer-in-Charge and was not even published nor made known to the workers who
came to know of its existence only at the hearing before the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(G.R. No. 86026, pp. 93-94, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">The principle involved in the case cited by the First Division
(Fernando v. <span class="SpellE">Angat</span> Labor Union [supra]) applies only
when the transferee is an entirely new corporation with a distinct personality
from the integrating firms and NOT where the transferee was found to be merely
an alter ego of the different merging firms, as in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Filport</span> has
the obligation not only to absorb the workers of the dissolved companies but
also to include the length of service earned by the absorbed employees with
their former employers as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To rule
otherwise would be manifestly less than fair, certainly, less than just and
equitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, to deny the private respondents the fruits of their
labor corresponding to the time they worked with their previous employers would
render at naught the constitutional provisions on labor protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In interpreting the protection to labor and
social justice provisions of the Constitution and the labor laws, and rules and
regulations implementing the constitutional mandate, the Supreme Court has
always adopted the liberal approach which favors the exercise of labor
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Euro-<span class="SpellE">Linea</span>,
