Monir Akbari appeals from the Decision of the Court of First Instance of
 Davao finding him guilty of Rape and sentencing him to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>,
 to indemnify the offended woman, Epifania Arboleda, in the sum of Ten 
Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) without subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay the costs.
<p>
The prosecution evidence is summarized in the People's Brief, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Complainant Epifania Arboleda, 47 years of age, and her husband, 
Santos Arboleda, were living in an iso­lated house located in Barrio 
Hijo, Municipality of Maco, Davao Province, with their two 
grandchildren, aged 6 and 7 years.  Their nearest neighbors were a 
kilometer away.  (t.s.n., p. 19, July 21, 1980). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Preparing to attend a procession in veneration of the Sto. Nino half a 
kilometer away, complainant woke up at 2:00 a.m. of June 16, 1979.  The 
dogs suddenly started barking warning her of the presence of some 
per­sons around the house.  Peeping out of the window, she saw four men 
outside, one of whom she immediately recog­nized as her neighbor, 
accused-appellant Monir Akbari.  The four men were wearing masks over 
their faces.  (t.s.n., pp. 4-5, July 21, 1980; p. 4, Nov. 18, 1980).
</p><p>
The intruders shouted to the couple to bring down the goats and nothing 
will happen to them.  Awakened by the noise, complainant's husband, 
Santos Arboleda, who was convalescing from rheumatic attacks, asked his 
wife what they ought to do.  Complainant replied that they should bring 
down the goats as ordered.  (t.s.n., pp. 5-6, July 21, 1980; p. 4, Nov. 
18, 1980).
</p><p>
When the couple went down bringing the goats, two of the men poked their
 guns at Santos' sides and ordered him to give them money.  Santos told 
them that they did not have any and the men ordered the couple to return
 to their house.  Before going up, the intruders fired two shots.  Still
 being covered by the guns of the two men, Santos went up and was 
ordered to sit on a bench in the kitchen.  The other two men, with guns 
pointed at the complainant, dragged her, to an adjoining room.  Once 
inside the room, they pushed her down, took off her skirt, blouse and 
panty until she was completely naked.  One of the men pinned down 
complainant's arms to the floor, while the other took off his pants and 
placed himself on top of her.  Initially, complainant struggled and 
resisted the assault.  But when the men threatened to kill her unless 
she submits to their wishes, she kept still, resigned to endure whatever
 the men intended to do with her.  After one of the men had satis­fied 
his carnal lust on her, he changed places with the other who then 
ravished her.  After the two men were through, they approached Santos 
and took over the task of guarding him while their two other companions 
also took turns in raping complainant, in the same manner as the first 
two had done.  They stopped after each of them had carnal knowledge of 
her twice.  Before leaving, the men threatened to kill them if the 
incident is re­ported to the police.
</p><p>
The couple thought it wise to keep the dishonor to themselves lest harm 
befall them, and the matter would not have been reported were it not for
 an incident which occurred sometime in September 1979 (tsn., pp. 6-16, 
July 21, 1980).  About three in the afternoon, Juan Toring, the 
son-in-law of complainant, went to the store of a certain Dino in 
Lupon-lupon, Maco, Davao Province and met appellant there.  The latter, 
who was drinking hea­vily, told Toring that he (appellant), Cesar 
Lloren, Buddy Sayong and Angelito Mancao took turns in having carnal 
knowledge with Epifania Arboleda and that it was enjoyable having sex 
with an older woman.  Upon hearing this, Toring relayed the matter to 
his mother-in-law.  This information given by her son-in-law prompted 
complainant to report the incident to the police authorities on October 
5, 1979.  At that time, all the suspects had disappeared with the 
exception of appellant Monir Akbari who was forthwith arrested and 
indicted of the instant charge.  Both complainant and her husband gave 
sworn state­ments before the police.  (tsn., pp. 18-19, November 18, 
1980, Exhs. '1' and '2')."
</p><p>
On the other hand, appellant Monir Akbari, 21 years old at the time of 
the incident, single, resident of Hijo, Maco, Davao, negated having 
violated the person of Epifania Arboleda, denied having said anything 
about the incident to Toring in the store, and contended that 
complainant is mentally abnormal and of ill repute in their community.  
Appellant's employer, Guillermo Bio, declared that Monir was a good man 
and that they both slept next to the copra dryer watching the drying the
 night that the alleged crime took place.  To prove that appellant was 
not certain of appellant's identity, defense witness Ali Sam testified 
that when Epifania complained to him about the incident in August, 1979,
 she mentioned the names of only the three who had abused her but not 
appellant's name.
</p><p>
The Court <em>a quo</em> found the defense posture unworthy of credence and, as aforestated, convicted appellant.
</p><p>
Appellant now claims that the Trial Court erred in holding a) that "the 
court harbors no doubt whatsoever that the event narrated by the 
complainant and her husband on the witness stand actually occurred at 
the place, date and time specified by them"; b) that ''his 
identification by the complainant as one of those who raped her should 
be considered in conjunction with the testimony of Juan Toring that 
accused Monir Akbari, in an unguarded moment, confessed to him that he 
(Akbari) was one of those who raped the herein complainant"; and c) in 
convicting him.
</p><p>
The first error assigned takes issue with the follow­ing findings of the Court <em>a quo</em>:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The court harbors no doubt whatsoever that the event narrated by 
the complainant and her husband on the witness stand actually occurred 
at the place, date and time specified by them.  The threats of the 
male­factors to return and kill Epifania and Santos were not to be taken
 lightly considering that the two had a foretaste of what the accused 
and his companions were capable of committing.  The desire to live under
 any condition is the most compelling of man's instincts.  Fear of death
 distorts one's judgment, depriving him of rational deci­sion, making 
him act or react to a situation in a manner that is ridiculous or 
downright foolish to one in full possession of his faculties.  In 
addition, considered with the degree of education, the social station 
and the nervous disposition of the complainant and her hus­band, their 
failure to report the incident in question for several months does not 
appear incredulous to the extent that it should be counted against their
 truthfulness."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We find no error in the conclusion thus reached.  The fact that 
complainant and her husband reported the incident to the police only 
about four months later does not detract from their credibility.  They 
explained that they had been warned not to report to the authorities and
 that they feared for their lives so that they thought it best to suffer
 the harrowing experience in silence.  The fear for their lives was real
 for they decided to "evacuate" and move to another house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  Besides, even in the ab­sence of a formal report, complainant did 
mention the inci­dent to Ali Sam, a defense witness, in August, 1979, as
 the latter himself had testified.  She had also disclosed it at a 
prayer meeting where the leader stated that help is given to those who 
share their problems with the flock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  The evidence discloses that the couple was unlettered and 
simple-minded.  The husband was 60 years old, sickly, hard of hearing, 
and could not understand Tagalog very well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  He just cried when complainant had told him of the carnal attack and regretted that he was sickly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  Neither was he in a position to give succor to his wife because two of
 the four culprits were guarding him with firearms by the table outside 
the room where his wife was being taken advantage of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Complainant was fanatically and blindly religious and just relied on God to save her from danger.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  She begged for mercy from the malefactors because she had just 
recovered from hemorrhage, but her pleas were unheeded.  She resigned 
herself to being ravished and just prayed realizing that she was 
powerless to do anything in the face of threats on her life by the four 
abusers.  The couple would have kept the dishonor and disgrace to 
themselves if appellant had not divulged and bragged about the matter 
publicly within the hearing of complainant's son-in-law.
</p><p>
As the Trial Court had observed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    As long as the indignities they suffered remained known to the 
couple only and were unknown to the rest of the family, most especially 
to their son-in-law and his wife, Epifania and Santos were disposed to 
suffer in silence.  When the matter was divulged to the public by a 
culprit, to the extent that their son-in-law was openly confronted with 
it, the couple painfully came to the conclusion that it was time to 
report the incident to the police if only to salvage the few shreds of 
dignity left in them.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defense makes much of complainant's answer to a question posed by defense counsel that she had experienced orgasm.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q.  Of course, when these persons have sexual inter­course with you, you experienced orgasm? </p>
  <p> "A.   Yes, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    It is doubtful, however, that complainant, unlettered as she was, could have understood the term.  For, she also testified:
  </p>
<blockquote>
    <p> "Q.  What did you feel when the first person had sexual intercourse with you? </p>
    <p> "A.   I was already scared because my husband was also scared. </p>
    <p> "Q.  Of course, you also enjoyed having sexual intercourse with them? </p>
    <p> "A.   I did not enjoy, I even thought I will die at that time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> When pressed by defense counsel further, she replied: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p> "Q.  Also at that time when Monir Akbari had inter­course with you, you had also orgasm? </p>
    <p> "A.   I already lost consciousness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Insofar as her moral character is concerned, complainant admitted that 
she had previously filed a charge for rape against one Cario Sam but 
that it did not prosper because her husband was convinced to withdraw 
the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  That 
happening, however, did not make complainant a woman of ill repute as 
appellant alleges.  The other attacks on her character and mental 
stability were considered by the trial Judge as "tenuous and fictitious 
to deserve serious consideration." Besides, even granting complainant's 
unchaste character, that is no defense in a charge of rape provided that
 the illicit relations were committed with force and violence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
The second assigned error has to do with complainant's identification of
 appellant.  Of this, there can be no doubt.  She testified that she 
recognized his voice and his face.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "FISCAL SOLEDAD: </p>
  <p> "Q.  How were you able to recognize Monir Akbari as one of those who raped you? </p>
  <p> "A    I recognized his voice because he even went to our house to ask salt and sometimes he ate there. </p>
  <p> "COURT: </p>
  <p> "Q.  Why you recognized only his voice? </p>
  <p> "A.   We were one time neighbors and he even decided one time to live with us. </p>
  <p> "Q.  Yes, why is it that you did not recognize his face? </p>
  <p> "A.   I recognized his face also, Your Honor. </p>
  <p> "Q.  You said you only recognized his voice? </p>
  <p> "A.   I also recognized his face.  (t.s.n., p. 18, July 21, 1980)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    That complainant did recognize appellant also appears in her 
statements before Municipal Judge Montano and policeman Villarosa.  
Complainant's husband also testified that he recognized only the 
appellant that evening.
  </p>
<blockquote>
    <p> "Q.  Now, did you recognize any of those 4 persons? </p>
    <p> "A.   I only recognized one. </p>
    <p> "Q.  Who? </p>
    <p> "A.   Monir."
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      x x x<span class="SpellE"></span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>                     x x x<span class="SpellE"></span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>                 x x x
    </p>
    <p> "Q.  Were you inside the house when they took turns in having sexual intercourse? </p>
    <p> "A.   I was already upstairs when they took turns. </p>
    <p> "Q.  How many of them took turns? </p>
    <p> "A.   Four of them </p>
    <p> "Q.  And who of four did you recognize? </p>
    <p> "A.   Monir. </p>
    <p> "Q.  You are referring to Monir when his shoulders you touched a while ago? </p>
    <p> "A.   Yes, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But even assuming that the identification by the couple was not 
reasonably certain, as the defense contends, Juan Toring's disclosure 
that in an unguarded moment under the influence of liquor appellant had 
divulged the incident and the names of his three companions corroborates
 the identification made by the couple.  The Trial Court, therefore, did
 not err in concluding:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The identification of Monir Akbari by the com­plainant as one of 
those who raped her should be considered in conjunction with the 
testimony of Juan Turing that accused Monir Akbari, in an unguarded 
moment, confessed to him that he (Akbari) was one of those who raped the
 herein complainant.  That accused Monir Akbari revealed that fact to 
Juan Turing is not open to doubts if one considers the events that 
swiftly followed it, i.e., the immediate action taken by the complainant
 and her husband in filing the corresponding complaint and execu­ting 
the supporting affidavits that initiated the prose­cution of the present
 case and the flight by the other persons identified by Monir Akbari to 
have participated in the commission of the offense. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Taken together, i.e., the identification of ac­cused Monir Akbari by the
 complainant and the admission of said complainant that he was one of 
those who raped her, leaves no room for doubt that he indeed committed 
the crime of rape herein charged."
</p><p>
The variance or contradictions in the testimony of complainant 
pointed-out by the defense refer merely to peripheral details that do 
not affect the substance of their statements.
</p><p>
In the final analysis, the basic issue focuses on the credibility of the
 contending witnesses and we hold that the findings and conclusions of 
the trial Judge with respect thereto are justified upon review of the 
evidence.  The records do not show anything of substance that could 
justify a reversal.
</p><p>
