Appeal from the decision in Criminal Case No. 651 of the then Court of 
First Instance of Iloilo convicting accused Benito Marbebe of the crime 
of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua 
with the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the complainant 
Rebecca Origin in the sum of P12,000.00 as moral damages, to acknowledge
 and support the offspring that may be borne out of the act of said 
accused, and to pay the costs.
<p>
The facts as narrated by the Solicitor General in his brief, based on the testimonies of the People's witnesses, are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That at about 7:45 in the evening of September 18, 1970 while she
 was standing in the corner of Mapa and O単ate Streets, Mandurriao, 
Iloilo City, waiting for a jeepney to take her to the University of 
Iloilo (p. 23, tsn., April 7, 1971), she was approached by the accused 
Benito Marbebe, then accompanied by the other accused Alfonso Escalera 
and Benito Marbebe then asked her to go with them to the Home Economics 
building in Mandurriao, Iloilo City, as he had something to talk with 
her (<em>Ibid</em>).  She answered that if he had something to tell her,
 he could tell it on the following day as she was in a hurry to go to 
the University of Iloilo to get tickets for the night class high school 
prom (p. 24, tsn., April 7, 1971).  Upon refusing Benito's invitation, 
Benito stuck a knife on the left side of her body telling her that if 
she would not go with them to the H.E. building, he would stab her (<em>Ibid</em>).
  Benito Marbebe then hold her left arm with his left hand and with his 
right hand holding the knife stuck on her left side, pushed her forward 
leading her to the premises of Mandurriao Elementary School passing on 
the left side of O単ate Street, then to the private road leading to the 
school premises until they reached the back porch of Mandurriao 
Elementary School (p. 25, tsn., April 7, 1971).  That Benito Marbebe 
then forced her to go up the stairs of the back porch of the H.E. 
building which was dark (p. 26, tsn., April 7, 1971) while the other 
accused Alfonso Escalera stayed below the porch (p. 28, tsn., April 7, 
1971) and once there, Benito Marbebe pulled off her chaleco or outer 
coat (p. 26, tsn., April 7, 1971) and then took off her dress which was 
with automatic button in front thus making her nude up to the waist (p. 
27, tsn., April 7, 1971).  That she at first held on to her dress but 
was told by accused Marbebe for her to keep still otherwise he would 
stab her (p. 29, tsn., April 7, 1971).  That after Benito took off her 
blouse, he then pulled down her short with stretchable garter including 
her panty exposing her whole naked body (<em>Ibid</em>).  The accused then held her by her right hand with his left hand and pushed her down to the wooden floor (<em>Ibid</em>),
 causing her to fall on a sitting position with her two hands propping 
up her body.  Benito then knelt down beside her left leg (p. 30, tsn., 
April 7, 1971), then suddenly pushed down her left leg with his left 
hand causing her to fall flat on the floor (p. 31, tsn., April 7, 1971).
  Marbebe then knelt down beside her left leg and pulled down his 
trousers and shorts (<em>Ibid</em>) and then laid on top of her, at the same time pointing his knife on the left side of her neck (<em>Ibid</em>).
  Marbebe then kicked, with his right foot, her left leg to make her 
legs spread out (p. 32, tsn., April 7, 1971) and while on top of her, 
Marbebe bit her right nipple (<em>Ibid</em>) and she then noticed that 
Marbebe held his organ to hers making undulated movements thereby 
causing his penis to penetrate her womb as she felt pain on her womb (<em>Ibid</em>),
 she cried as she was afraid to shout because she was threatened that if
 she would not keep still he would stab her (pp. 24-25, tsn., May 31, 
1971).  That while Marbebe was having carnal knowledge with her, they 
heard somebody calling her name coming from a pathway leading to the 
H.E. building (p. 32, tsn., April 7, 1971) and she recognized the voice 
to be that of her elder brother Leandro Origin (pp. 33, tsn., April 7, 
1971).  That on hearing this call, Benito Marbebe then raised his body 
kneeling between her thighs and she then felt something sticky fell on 
her belly and lap (<em>Ibid</em>) and Benito then pulled up his pants and when her brother Leandro arrived on the stairway, Benito jumped over the balustrade (<em>Ibid</em>).
  When her brother reached her, he asked her what happened and she told 
her brother that she was raped by Benito Marbebe (p. 24, tsn., April 7, 
1971).  Her brother then made her put on her dress and told her for them
 to go home (<em>Ibid</em>).  That on their way to the stairs of the 
H.E. building, she stepped on a knife which she picked up and gave it to
 her brother and when shown a stainless kitchen knife presented as 
Exhibit 'C' (pp. 34-35, tsn., April 7, 1971), she identified it similar 
to the knife she picked up that evening and gave to her brother Leandro 
and also similar to the knife which Benito Marbebe threatened to kill 
her (<em>Ibid</em>).  That when they arrived in their house, her brother
 related to their mother what happened to her and she then washed her 
belly and thigh including her womb as she felt dirty (p. 36, tsn., April
 7, 1971).  Their mother then sent for her uncle Benito Zamora known to 
them as Tio Dione who lives nearby and when her uncle arrived, they went
 with their uncle to the police station in Mandurriao at about 8:50 or 
8:55 that evening (<em>Ibid</em>) and there filed their complaint to 
Cpl. Huervas to whom her uncle also gave the knife that she gave to her 
brother Leandro Origin (pp. 36-37, tsn., April 7, 1971).  Cpl. Huervas 
then called for the mobile patrol of the Iloilo City Police and when it 
arrived, they were taken to the police headquarters, she was then 
examined physically by Dr. Tito Doromal (<em>Ibid</em>), medico-legal 
officer of the Iloilo City Police Department who issued her a medical 
certificate which she also identified and marked as Exhibit 'A' (p. 38, 
tsn., April 7, 1971). </p>
  <p> "Dr. Tito Doromal, medico-legal officer of the Iloilo City Police 
Department testified that at about 11:00 in the evening of September 18,
 1970 he physically examined Rebecca Origin at his office in the Iloilo 
City Police Department (p. 4, tsn., March 17, 1971) and on his 
examination he found fresh lacerations of the hymen at 3:00, 7:00, 9:00 
and 10:00 positions, with the vaginal opening which could admit with 
difficulty two fingers, - middle and forefingers (p. 5, tsn., March 17, 
1971).  He found no seminal fluid inside the womb (<em>Ibid</em>).  He also found an abrasion on the fourchetts of about 3 mm. in a diameter at the base (<em>Ibid</em>).
  He further found contusion 1.5 by 3 cm. in diameter posterior aspect 
upper third right forearm and another contusion 1 x 1.5 cm. in diameter 
at the arreola mamma or nipple right at 11:00 position which could have 
been caused by a bite of teeth (<em>Ibid</em>).  Witness further 
testified that the lacerations in the hymen inflicted less than 12 hours
 before his examination could have been caused by the insertion of a 
male organ (p. 6, tsn., March 17, 1971).  He also explained that the 
abrasion on the fourchetts which is located at the base of the vagina 
with a V-shape could have been caused by the pressure of a male organ 
(pp. 6-7, tsn., March 17, 1971). </p>
  <p> "He identified the medical certificate he issued marked as Exhibit
 'A' (p. 4, tsn., March 17, 1971)." (pp. 2-7, Appellee's Brief) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Against the foregoing evidence of the prosecution, accused-appellant 
Benito Marbebe, 19 years old, admitted having had carnal knowledge with 
Rebecca Origin on the night of September 18, 1970, not with the use of 
force or through intimidation but with her full consent.  He testified 
that about 6:30 to 7:00 in the evening of September 18, 1970, he was 
with Alfonso Escalera in the public market of Mandurriao, Iloilo City.  
They saw Rebecca Origin walking along O単ate Street going to the corner 
of Mapa and O単ate Streets near the police station.  He and Escalera 
approached Rebecca and he invited her to go with them to the Home 
Economics building of the Mandurriao Elementary School.  Rebecca agreed 
with the request that they should not stay there long.  Upon reaching 
the place, accused told Escalera to go down.  After Escalera had left, 
he (accused-appellant) kissed Rebecca and she did not resist.  He was 
about to undress her but she stopped him, saying that she would do it 
herself.  After Rebecca had undressed herself nude, he took off his 
shirt and trousers, and approaching Rebecca they embraced each other.  
He then told her to lie down which she did.  They had sexual intercourse
 and after having consummated the act, they both sat in the porch.  Few 
minutes later they heard a voice from a distance calling for Rebecca.  
This was followed by another call and a third one and when he realized 
that it was Leandro Origin, an elder brother of Rebecca, he jumped from 
the porch and went under the building.  Leandro Origin, instead of 
following him, went up the building where he saw Rebecca nude.  Leandro 
asked her sister who her companion was but the latter did not answer.  
Leandro gave fist blows at Rebecca who was ordered to put on her dress. 
 When Rebecca and Leandro were going down the stairs, he (appellant) saw
 Leandro holding a stainless knife.
</p><p>
Further, appellant testified that prior to September 18, 1970, he and 
Rebecca have been sweethearts for about a year, after three months of 
courtship.  Leandro did not know he was courting his sister because he 
never went to visit her in her house.  Before September 18, he had dated
 Rebecca twice - the first, in an unoccupied house, and the second, 
inside a movie house.
</p><p>
In this appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in convicting him.
</p><p>
Appellant claims that the knife identified by the complainant as the 
instrument used against her did not belong to him; that it was 
improbable that the said 7 1/2-inch stainless steel knife which he 
allegedly pointed at Rebecca's body would not have been noticed by 
people nearby considering that the place was well-lighted; that the 
invitation to go to the dark back porch of the Home Economics building 
could and should have been refused by her; and, that the performance of 
the sexual act of appellant, as described by complainant, is acrobatic 
and ceremonious.
</p><p>
We are not persuaded and We affirm the decision of the trial court.  The
 fact that nobody noticed appellant pointing a knife at complainant is 
possible considering that the incident happened about 7:45 in the 
evening and complainant was between appellant and his companion Alfonso 
Escalera.  And, there is no evidence that on the way to the Home 
Economics building they met people who could have noticed the knife 
poked at complainant's side.  There is nothing unusual either about the 
knife being left behind when appellant jumped out of the building upon 
hearing the voice of complainant's brother.  The impulse of anyone in 
such a situation would be to escape considering that Leandro's 
appearance was sudden and unexpected.  Rebecca's testimony, he averred, 
on how the sexual intercourse was consummated was nothing less than 
acrobatic because when he placed himself on top of her, his body was 
supported by his left hand while his right hand was holding a knife 
pointed at the left neck of Rebecca.  It was impossible, he argued, for 
him to have done the act with his body being sustained only by one hand,
 in which case, the intercourse was done in an unusual manner.
</p><p>
We do not see the impossibility in the consummation of the act because 
his body could be leaning on both of his arms, with the right hand also 
holding the knife.  That way, there could have been no difficulty in 
perpetrating the crime of rape.  Finally, if appellant's story is true 
and correct We cannot imagine why Rebecca, after the alleged sexual act 
was done with her full consent, was still naked when they were already 
seated at the porch and when her brother Leandro arrived.  The first 
thing any woman would do after the act would be to put on her clothes.  
The fact that she was naked when Leandro arrived only confirms her 
testimony that appellant jumped out of the porch when he was still on 
top of her.  We also take note of the observation of the trial court 
with respect to complainant's demeanor on the witness stand.  She was 
only 17 years old.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x The manner the complaining witness testified, her 
demonstration as to how the accused threatened her with a knife at 
corner Mapa-O単ate Street, how the accused undressed her in the dark back
 porch of the H.E. building, how the accused subsequently pushed her 
down to the floor, the manner she related all these things while in the 
witness stand, the way she answered the question of the prosecuting 
fiscal, the court and defense counsel, all these circumstances taken 
together convinced us of the truth of what the complaining witness had 
testified.  The circumstances testified to by prosecution witnesses 
Leandro Origin, Leonardo Londres and Police Cpl. Huervas all tend to 
corroborate the testimony of the complaining witness.  x x x </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and that of appellant -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x We noticed that while the accused was in the witness stand,
 by his mannerism of testifying in court, he appeared unconcerned to the
 gravity of the charge against him, so much so, that the Court noticing 
his behavior in the witness stand, the way he answered the questions of 
his counsel, of the court and of the prosecuting fiscal, had to call his
 attention to the fact that the crime charged is a very serious one, 
carrying with it a penalty of a long prison term or even a life 
sentence.  In spite of this warning, the Court noted the unconcerned 
behavior of the accused who oftentimes grinned or smiled while in the 
witness stand.  For this reason, and the improbability of his testimony,
 it is the considered opinion of the court that the accused could not be
 relied for truthfulness and we cannot believe his testimony that he had
 carnal knowledge with the complainant's consent without the use of 
force or intimidation." (pp. 16-18, Decision of the lower court) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED in toto with the 
modification that the moral damages is increased from P12,000.00 to 
P15,000.00.  With costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
