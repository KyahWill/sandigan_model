refusal of the collector to accept her tender of payment; and that <span class="SpellE">laches</span> had deprived private respondent of whatever right he
had against her considering that the Complaint was filed only in September,

<blockquote><span style="mso-font-kerning:1.0pt">"Petitioner's claim that
private respon­dent's cause of action is barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that
petitioner's arrearages date back to February, 1974, however, a tenant's mere

rents </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-font-kerning:1.0pt">after
a demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is made that entitles the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to bring an action of Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
has the privi­lege to waive his right to bring an action against his tenant and
give the latter credit for the payment of the rents and allow him to continue
indefinitely in the possession of the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>During such period, the tenant would not be in illegal possession of the
premises and the landlord can not maintain an action until after he has taken
steps to convert the legal possession into an illegal possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case at bar, the demand on
petitioner to vacate the premises for failure to pay the rentals thereon was
made by private respondent only on August 23, 1976 and the Complaint against
petitioner was filed on September 16, 1976.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

petitioner's non-payment of the rentals on the premises, notwithstanding demand
made by private respondent, and her failure to avail of the remedy provided for
in Article 1256 of the Civil Code, entitles private respondent to eject her

the question of whether or not private respondent is the owner of the leased

the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some fact or
circumstance of weight and substance that would have affected the result of the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since the petitioner has not
presented sufficient proof that the leased premises is not the same lot
registered in the name of the private respondent, the findings of the lower
courts on the fact of ownership of the leased premises will not be disturbed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
