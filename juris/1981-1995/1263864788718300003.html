<blockquote><span style="mso-font-kerning:1.0pt">"Petitioner's claim that
private responÂ­dent's cause of action is barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that
petitioner's arrearages date back to February, 1974, however, a tenant's mere

rents </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-font-kerning:1.0pt">after
a demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is made that entitles the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to bring an action of Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
has the priviÂ­lege to waive his right to bring an action against his tenant and
give the latter credit for the payment of the rents and allow him to continue
indefinitely in the possession of the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>During such period, the tenant would not be in illegal possession of the
premises and the landlord can not maintain an action until after he has taken
steps to convert the legal possession into an illegal possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case at bar, the demand on
petitioner to vacate the premises for failure to pay the rentals thereon was
made by private respondent only on August 23, 1976 and the Complaint against
petitioner was filed on September 16, 1976.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

petitioner's non-payment of the rentals on the premises, notwithstanding demand
made by private respondent, and her failure to avail of the remedy provided for

the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some fact or
circumstance of weight and substance that would have affected the result of the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since the petitioner has not
presented sufficient proof that the leased premises is not the same lot
registered in the name of the private respondent, the findings of the lower
