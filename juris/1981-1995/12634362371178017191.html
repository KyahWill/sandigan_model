Understandably, accused-appellant zeroes in on the alleged inconsistencies in
the rape victim's testimony to extricate himself from criminal liability.  Denying any such inconsistencies, the People
point out to the stark-naked fact that the accused-appellant hid for fifteen
(15) years right after the rape to elude arrest.  Yielding to the Court's constitutionally derived power to review
all criminal cases in which the penalty of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

accused-appellant leaves his fate to the court's disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As synthesized by the Solicitor General, the facts of the case
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On 15 November 1970, at about 7:00 A.M, complainant Alejandra
Evangelista was sent by her parents Ignacio Evangelista and Mercedes
Evangelista to get her father's gun at her sister's residence in Mangatarem,
Pangasinan.  She was then sixteen (16)
years old and a grade five pupil of Quetegan Elementary School (TSN, January
14, 1986, p. 2).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant walked from their residence in Barangay Calumbuyan,
Mangatarem, Pangasinan to Quetegan, Pangasinan and from there she rode on a
mini-bus going to Mangatarem town proper.  By noon of the same day, complainant went home by taking a jeep to
Barangay Quetegan and from there she had to walk, passing Barangays Bulalacao
and Linmansangan, to reach Barangay Calumbuyan (Ibid., p. 3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>While walking along the road of Barangay Bulalaco, complainant
noticed that she was being followed by two individuals.  Complainant identified the first as the
appellant but she did not recognize his companion.  Soon the appellant and his companion parted ways and the former
continued following the complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moments later, appellant was able to overtake the complainant.
Suddenly, appellant held the complainant and thrust a knife at the right side
of her neck (Ibid, p. 4). He pulled the complainant toward the bushes about ten
(10) meters away from the house of the Diaz Family.  Appellant continued to drag her to a forested area about fifteen
(15) meters from the road (Ibid, p. 5) where he pushed the complainant to the
ground and she fell on her back.  Appellant immediately knelt and, with his right hand, he removed his
pants.  Complainant attempted to stand
but she was pushed again by the appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(TSN,
</span>January 27, 1986, p. 4).  While
the appellant was on his knees, he pulled down the complainant's trousers and
her underwear.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant pleaded not to touch her but she was ignored by the
appellant. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As the </span>complainant
continued to resist, appellant slapped her on both sides of her face and then
held her shoulders as he started to insert his penis into her vagina.  Despite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">the </span>complainant's resistance, appellant succeeded in inserting
his penis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant continued to satisfy his desire on the complainant while
the latter tried to push and kick the appellant until she was able to free
herself from the appellant's hold.  Complainant immediately stood up and ran toward the road while shouting
for help.  An old man named Mama Ado
dela Cruz responded but by the time he reached the place where the complainant
was molested, appellant had already run away (TSN, January 14, 1986, p. 6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dela Cruz took the complainant to the house of Barangay Captain of
Bulalacao where she waited for her parents.  When her parents arrived, they reported the incident to the municipal
health officer who accompanied them to San Carlos General Hospital, San Carlos
City, Pangasinan (Ibid., p. 7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The medico-legal examination on the complainant was made by Dr.
Juanita Abrenio.  Her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">examination was </span>offered as Exhibit
"A" which is reproduced as follows:</blockquote>

He asks the Court to consider the following:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  In her direct
testimony, complainant Alejandra Evangelista testified that she was walking
ahead of the accused and the latter was following her with a companion whom she
failed to recognize.  (TSN, Jan. 27,
1986, p. 4).  Whereas in her sworn
statement, she stated that she was following the accused and the latter stopped
and waited for her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Continuing her
testimony, she declared that accused was able to catch up with her and overtake
her.  Then accused poked a balisong at
her right neck and pulled her to a forested area.  (TSN, Ibid, p. 5).  In her
sworn statement, she stated that when she got near the accused, the latter
embraced her, held her and dragged her in the bushes of an isolated area.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  She testified as well
that accused removed first her pant(ies) and accused followed this by removing
his pants and went on top of her (Ibid, p. 5).  It appears on her affidavit that accused first removed his pants and
trousers and then followed her panty and went on top of her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  She declared that
accused had sexual intercourse with her for about ten (10) minutes (Ibid, p. 5)
but in her sworn statement she said that it took him more than two (2) minutes
to have sexual act with her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  That when accused had
sexual intercourse with her, she struggled by kicking him but she was slapped
on her right and left face.  She was
able to extricate herself after accused had successfully molested her.   She ran away and shouted for help and she met
Aldo dela Cruz who helped her retrieve her pant(ies) at the scene of the
crime.  She was brought by dela Cruz at
the house of Brgy. Captain of Limansangan (Ibid, 6).  Compared this to her sworn statement, she stated that after the
accused had sexual contact with her for about two minutes, he took hold of her
nipple and boxed her several times on her thigh and stomach.  She tried to escape and shouted for help and
when accused overtook her again, she was kicked, her hair was grabbed and
pulled.  She fell to the ground with her
face downward and accused stepped on her several times.  Then several person who heard her shout came
to her rescue and helped her gather her things.  Then Aldo dela Cruz was called by these persons to identify
her."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Solicitor General claims that
accused-appellant's contention is without merit because:</p>

<blockquote>“Appellant never presented during the trial the two allegedly
inconsistent statements of complainant.  Hence, the complainant was deprived of the chance to explain the alleged
discrepancies.  Under section 13, Rule
132 of the Rules of Court of the Philippines, complainant's testimony can not
be impeached by mere allegation of those previous statements.  x x x<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx (said) provision mandates the proper procedure for impeaching a
witness by evidence of alleged inconsistent statements.  This procedure requires ‘laying the
predicate,’ that is:  (a) by confronting
the witness with such statements, with the circumstances under which they were
made; (b) by asking him whether he made such statements, and (c) by giving him
the chance to explain the inconsistency.  If the statements were made in writing, the documents must be shown to
the witness before he may be asked to explain the discrepancy.  Unless the witness is given the opportunity
to explain the inconsistency, the impeachment is incomplete (Regalado, Remedial
Law Compendium, Sixth Revised Edition, p. 537, Citing <u>U.S. vs. Baluyot</u>,
40 Phil. 385; <u>People vs. Rosabal</u>, 50 Phil. 780; <u>People vs. Escosura</u>,
46 O.G., 918, et al.).  In the case at
bar, the appellant never raised the alleged inconsistent statements during the
trial.  Consequently, such statements
cannot now be used to impeach complainant."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, issues not raised in the court below cannot be
raised for the first time on appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> But
even assuming that it was the prosecution itself which offered said sworn
statements as part of the People's evidence and accused-appellant is now
pointing out the inconsistencies between Alejandra's sworn statements and her
testimony in court -- and therefore obviating the need of impeaching her
testimony by means of prior inconsistent statements<a style="mso-footnote-id:

-- the alleged inconsistencies, if any, do not militate against her credibility

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant harps on the alleged pregnancy of the
complainant resulting from the alleged rape incident and her eventual abortion
a month later.  He states that such is
not possible for she was menstruating at the time of the alleged rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General explains that the vaginal bleeding of the
complainant was caused by the sudden penetration of appellant's penis in her
vagina.  He says that the words
"menstrual flow" in the medical report were in parentheses because
the examining physician was not positive that the slight vaginal bleeding was
also caused by the complainant's menstrual period.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Vaginal bleeding is NOT an element in rape as what is important
is that the rape victim testified that the appellant sexually abused her with
force and intimidation and against her will.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> When

<blockquote>[N]o decent and sensible woman will publicly admit being a rape victim
and thus run the risk of public contempt - the dire consequence of a rape  charge - unless she is, in fact, a rape
victim (People vs. Paringit, 189 SCRA 478).  (At page 12)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the alleged pregnancy an important element in the
crime charged, its relevancy being only that if the offended party had given
birth to a live baby then the accused-appellant would be ordered to support the

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant claims further that:</p>

<blockquote>“There is no ample evidence on record to support the trial court's
finding that complainant received death threats from the accused after the
incident.  This finding would run
counter to prosecution's theory that after the incident, accused was never seen
in their barangay and went into hiding and surfaced only two years after.  Thus, how could accused make good his threat
on complainant if he was nowhere to be found."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Solicitor General contends that:</p>

<blockquote>“Complainant's statement that she received death threats from
appellant is credible.  Appellant lived
only two hundred (200) meters away from the house of complainant.  Hence, it was not impossible for appellant
to display threatening gestures at complainant who was compelled to work in Manila
