Sacay was a Patrolman in the Western Police District, Masinop Street, Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; He was on duty on April 12, 1979, the date of the riot incident in Don Bosco Compound in Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; He admitted having shot with a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver Antonio Tepace and Paterno N. Lerma who were among the rioters, but invoked self-defense and fulfillment of duty to justify his act of shooting said deceased.<br><br>As correctly stated by respondent Court; "Having admitted the two gun-shot killings charged, the accused assumed the burden of showing legal justification therefor.&nbsp; He has to substantiate the justifying circumstance invoked.&nbsp; He is called upon to spell out and describe convincingly how he acted in complete self-defense and/or due fulfillment of official duty, as claimed by him; otherwise, he must suffer all the consequences of his malefaction.&nbsp; And he has to rely on the qualitative and quantitative strength of his own evidence; not on the weak­ness of the prosecution; for even if it were weak it could not be disbelieved after he had admitted the killings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The first witness for the prosecution in the killing of the deceased was Veneranda Lagrimas.&nbsp; As summarized by the Sandiganbayan, her testimony was as follows:<br><blockquote>"She narrated that as she was outside the church near Marcos Road, some twenty (20) meters from the NHA and NHCC Compound, at about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of April 15, 1979, Patrol­man Virgilio Sacay shot Antonio Tepace inside the Don Bosco Compound near said Church.&nbsp; Many people, including Boy Rodrigo, were then playing basketball inside the Don Bosco compound, she recalled."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>Her testimony was, however, cut short when the defense admitted the killings in question and the prosecution asked that the reverse procedure be adopted as in the other cases in that court.&nbsp; Justice Rallos commented that it would be improper for the Court to provide or suggest the procedure to follow.&nbsp; Thereafter, the prosecutor opted to submit the case on the basis of the admission of the accused, but without prejudice to presenting the medical certificates on rebuttal.&nbsp; Witness Lagrimas was discharged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> To prove civil liability, Leonida Nubio Tepace, mother of Antonio N. Tepace, and Francisca Lerma Y. Naldo, mother of Paterno N. Lerma, were placed on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>With the admission thus made by the defense, the testimonies of the aforementioned witnesses and its documentary evidence consisting of Exhibit "A", death certificate of Paterno N. Lerma; Exhibit "B", death certificate of Antonio N. Tepace; Exhibit "C", post mortem findings on the body of Antonio N. Tepace and Exhibit "D", post mortem findings on the body of Paterno N. Lerma, the prosecution closed its evidence in chief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>For the defense, the following testimonies were also summarized by the trial court, as follows:<br><br><i>Testimony of Juanito Yang, member of WPD and assigned with the Homicide Investigation Section:</i><br><blockquote>"He prepared on April 16, 1979, the report marked Exhibit "I" and took down the statement of Alfredo Madrigo (Exhibit "2"), of Robert Catangjas (Exhibit "3") and of Leonila Galit (Exhibit "4").&nbsp; As stated in the report Exhibit "I", he received from Pfc. Cabildo in the afternoon of April 15, 1979 the 10-inch long knife (Exhibit "5" together with a firearm which he submitted for ballistic examination per receipt (Exhibit "7").&nbsp; According to Pfc. Cabildo, the aforesaid knife and firearm were confiscated by Patrolman Virgilio Sacay during a gang war inside the Don Bosco compound in Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; In connection with the the shooting of Antonio N. Tepace and Paterno N. Lerma, he invited Pat. Virgilio Sacay for investigation but the latter refused to give any written statement.&nbsp; The accused opted, instead to submit the affidavit (Exhibit "6") rather than to be interrogated.<br><br>"As the investigator designated to look into the case, he went to and saw at the Tondo General Hospital the cadavers of Paterno Lerma and Antonio Tepace bearing tatoo marks of BCJ as indicated in the third paragraph (Exhibit "1-A") of Exhibit "I".&nbsp; Starting the investigation of the incident at bar in the afternoon of April 15, 1979, he prepared his report (Exhibit "I") the following day.&nbsp; It was 1:00 to 2:00 a.m. of April 16, 1979 that the accused presented the already finished affidavit (Exhibit "6").&nbsp; He interviewed not only Madrigo and Catangjas but also Pat. Rodolfo Amado, the one who dispatched Sacay to verify a reported rioting at the scene of the incident in question.&nbsp; Pat. Amado sent only Sacay because it was just for the purpose of verifying the veracity of said report."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Testimony of Bonifacio Abaño, Jr. Y Rom, security guard of Don Bosco Youth Center.<br><blockquote>"Bonifacio Abaño, Jr. Y Rom, security guard of Don Bosco Youth Center whose tour of duty on April 15, 1979 was from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., identified his "Sinum­paang Salaysay" of May 8, 1981, marked Exhibit "8" and reaffirmed its contents.&nbsp; He narrated that at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of April 15th, he phoned Police Station I about a brewing confrontation between the warring Sigue Sigue-Sputnik and Batang City Jail Gangs which were outside the Don Bosco compound, with the latter positioning themselves at Marcos Road and the former along Carlos P. Garcia Street, Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; Responding to his call for police intervention, Patrolman Sacay arrived in civilian clothes.&nbsp; Sacay was the lone policeman to show up at the place where the rioters were already shouting and throwing stones and darts at each other.&nbsp; The first thing Sacay did was to fire two warning shots and identify himself as a peace officer by shouting "I am a policeman".&nbsp; Then, he ordered the fight to stop but, instead five of the rioters one of whom holding a revolver and a bladed weapon, ran towards and unsuccessfully tried twice to stab Sacay who shot and felled the said aggressor.&nbsp; At the precise moment when the said aggressor named "Fernando" was thrusting a bladed instrument towards Sacay, and the latter fired at the former, the two were just 3 &amp; 1/2 feet apart.&nbsp; After hearing two more gun rapports, two men fell but did not see any particular person being hit by Sacay's tirades.&nbsp; Others docked and ultimately surrendered, this witness who claims to have been twenty meters from the protagonists, recounted.<br><br>"Cross-examination elicited from witness that after firing the last shot, Sacay stood up and ordered the trouble makers to stop even as some of them were running.&nbsp; He did not notice Sacay leaving the crime scene because when people were coming, he was preoccupied closing the gate of the Don Bosco compound.&nbsp; He did not also see what ride was used by Sacay who was alone.&nbsp; He could not tell if Sacay fired immediately but he did observe that Sacay fired only after the aggressor's second thrust towards Sacay.&nbsp; He heard a shot and saw Sacay shooting the fellow.&nbsp; There were four shots, all in all, witness said."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><i>Testimony of Ramon Pintado y Baguio, Ballistician or Firearm Identification Technician, WPD Evidence Laboratory:</i><br><blockquote>"Ramon Pintado y Baguio, ballisti­cian or firearm identification technician of WPD's Evidence Laboratory, also mounted the witness stand for the defense to state that on April 20, 1979, Cpl. Yang request­ed ballistic examination of a .38 caliber revolver with Serial Number SN-243277 used by Pat. Virgilio Sacay on April 15, 1979 in repelling aggression coming from Antonio Tepace and Paterno Lerma.&nbsp; Subject firearm was accompanied with the "Reference Slip" marked Exhibit "9".&nbsp; Then, on April 24, or four days later, Yang was back to ask ballistic examination also of a .22 caliber Magnum revolver having serial No. SN-2424 (Exhibit "11") with three (3) rounds of live ammo and one (1) fired cartridge contained in the envelope marked Exhibit "12".&nbsp; The subsequent request was embodied in the "Reference Slip" marked Exhibit "10".&nbsp; Placed in another envelope marked Exhibit "13" are two (2) test shells and two (2) test bullets utilized for the examination of subject .22 caliber revolver, the result of which ballistic test is shown in the findings and conclusions (Exhibit "14-B") in the Laboratory Report No. 5790.<br><br>"As thus requested, he conducted on May 7, 1979 the desired ballistic exami­nation for the purpose of determining whether the .22 caliber discharged cart­ridge with the initial "JY" was fired from the said .22 caliber paltik revolver bearing Serial Number 2424.&nbsp; The spent cartridge was found inside the chamber of subject firearm but no spent bullet from the same gun was submitted to him for examination, this witness revealed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Testimony of Virgilio Sacay y Valdez, accused member of the Western Police District:<br><blockquote>"On April 15, 1979, he was a station reserve from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.&nbsp; In the afternoon, he was instructed by the Actg. Desk Officer, Patrolman Amado Adolfo, to verify a phoned report regard­ing a riot at the Don Bosco premises in Barangay Magsaysay Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; Right away, he boarded a passenger jeepney.&nbsp; He was alone and in plain clothes.&nbsp; Upon arrival at the reported scene of trouble, shooting of darts between members of the Sigue Sigue-Sputnik gang and Batang City Jail gang was taking place.&nbsp; He knew the identity of the warring groups because he grew up in the area.&nbsp; At the right side facing north were members of the Sigue Sigue-Sputnik gang.&nbsp; On the left side of the Don Bosco compound were those belonging to the Batang City Jail gang.&nbsp; He entered the compound via the left gate (the right gate was closed) and met Virginia Nacar who told him that the throwing of stones and darts by about twenty (20) people had been going on for quite a time.&nbsp; Among the people involved were Paterno Lerma, Antonio Tepace, Alfredo Mondrigo and Roberto Catangjas.&nbsp; Closing in on the protagonists, he iden­tified himself as a policeman and fired two warning shots.<br><br>"After the warning shots were fired, members of the Sigue Sigue-Sputnik gang dispersed.&nbsp; They ran towards the right gate of the Don Bosco compound.&nbsp; But members of the Batang City Jail Gang ran to the place where he was and one of them, Paterno Lerma who was only an arm's length away, lunged an 8-inch knife at him.&nbsp; Luckily, he was able to evade the thrust by moving backward.&nbsp; In so stepping to the rear, however, a big stone blocked his leg, causing him to sit on the buttocks and while in such position Lerma approached at the left and as he (accused) stood up, Lerma tried once more to stab him with the same weapon; and so he fired his service gun at Lerma who was mortally hit.<br><br>"Denying the imputation that he shot Paterno Lerma when the latter was kneeling down, the accused went on to narrate that after Lerma was fatally wounded, Antonio Tepace, Lerma's gangmate, shot him (accused) with a .22 caliber magmun revolver from a distance of two meters but missed him so that to protect his life, he fired back at Tepace who thereafter slumped on the ground.<br><br>"To reinforce his theory of self-defense and fulfillment of duty, the accused also declared that the .22 caliber magnum revolver (Exhibit "11") with three (3) live ????? and one spent shell (Exhibit "12") was picked up from the ground near the hands of the deceased Antonio Tepace and the knife (Exhibit "5") was taken near the hands of Paterno Lerma inside the Don Bosco compound that afternoon of April 15, 1979.&nbsp; Investiga­ted later by P/Cpl. Johnny Yang of WPD's Homicide Section on the same day of the unfortunate happening, he gave the affidavit (Exhibit "6") to said police investigator.&nbsp; To the Tanodbayan, he turned in the counter-affidavit (Exhibit "18") including the annexes marked Exhibits "18-A" to "18-D" pertaining to the derogatory police and court records of the deceased Paterno Lerma and Antonio Tepace who were full of tatoo marks of the Batang City Jail Gang.<br><br>"Such in a nutshell, was the tale of the accused before the court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Testimony of Eusebio Arguelles y Magpantay, police chemist of Manila's finest.<br><blockquote>"He testified that Patrolman Rodolfo Buenaventura who is now retired, was under his administrative supervision.&nbsp; Upon the request of P/Cpl. Yang, Buenaventura subjected to paraffin test the body of the late Antonio Tepace about 7:30 in the afternoon of April 16, 1979 at the Capitol Memorial Chapel.&nbsp; Although he did not actually see the written request of P/Cpl. Yang therefor, Buenaventura informed him of the paraffin test thus made whereby the latter took a paraffin cast from the dorsal side of the right and left hands of Antonio Tepace.&nbsp; Thereafter, he conducted thereon a diphenylamine test which gave positive reaction to the presence of nitrates or nitrites, a finding mentioned in that portion marked exhibit "16-1" of the laboratory report marked Exhibit "16".<br><br>"The witness pointed to Exhibits "17" and "17-A" as the patterns of the right and left hands of Antonio Tepace y Nubia.<br><br>"On cross-examination, he opined that the presence of nitrates on the dorsal side of the right hand of Antonio Tepace could have been caused by gun powder residues.&nbsp; Because of the possibility of contamination upon touching any object, the palm of subject cadaver was not examined anymore, he justified.&nbsp; Told that the deceased Antonio Tepace died a day before the paraffin examina­tion was made, he did not discount the possibility that during the 24-hour period following the death of Antonio Tepace, the dead man's hand could have been used by someone to fire a gun thereby rendering the dorsal side of such hand positive of nitrates."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Testimony of Veneranda P. Lagrimas, on rebuttal for the Prosecution:<br><blockquote>"Veneranda P. Lagrimas testified that at about 4:00 o'clock in the after­noon of April 15, 1979, she was in the church near Don Bosco compound in Tondo to fulfill her Sunday obligation.&nbsp; While outside the said church, she saw Patrolman Sacay, the accused herein, alighting from a passenger jeepney.&nbsp; There was no clash between the Sigue Sigue Sputnik gang and the Batang City Jail gang, she said.&nbsp; According to her, upon the arrival of the accused at the place of the incident complained of, he did not say "magsitigil kayo, pulis ako, si Sacay ako" but said "magsilapit kayo" and commanded the three persons, including Antonio Tepace, to "raise your hands, kneel, lie flat on your stomach" which order the three obeyed.&nbsp; The accused fired no warning shot; he aimed his gun at the people.&nbsp; Paterno Lerma was unarmed, had no knife and never lunged any knife at the accused who shot Lerma even as Lerma was running away with face looking backward at the accused, witness recalled.<br><br>"As regards the deceased, Antonio Tepace, she categorically revealed that the latter was equally unarmed.&nbsp; He never fired, had no gun to fire and was actually lying flat on his stomach with hands stretched forward when fatally shot by the accused, she recounted.&nbsp; Shown Exhibit "F", she acknowledged the same to be the sworn statement she executed in connection with the shooting incident at bar.&nbsp; She affirmed the truth of its contents.<br><br>"On cross-examination, she went on to state that she had known the late Antonio Tepace even prior to April 15, 1979 because he used to buy viand in her house.&nbsp; But she never saw Paterno Lerma alive.&nbsp; He was already dead when she saw his lifeless body.&nbsp; As to why she failed to present herself for police investigation not long after the tragic happening under inquiry, she pointed out that it was her impression that no complaint would even be filed in relation thereto.&nbsp; It was only when the mother of Antonio Tepace was crying over lack of witnesses to testify against the feared accused that she became aware of the intention of the bereaved family to sue.&nbsp; So, three days later, she was accompanied to the police station by the sorrowful mother of Antonio Tepace and, then and there, she executed her affidavit (Exhibit "F").<br><br>"More on the environmental facts surrounding the shooting litigated upon, she further divulged that there were a lot of churchgoers and no basketball game was being played at the time because a Sunday afternoon mass was about to begin."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>Testimony of Dr. Luis Larion y Craig, medico legal officer of the Western Police District, sur-rebuttal witness for the defense:<br><blockquote>"Sometime in April, 1979, he performed post-mortem examination and autopsy on the cadaver of the deceased, Antonio Tepace, and in the course thereof, recovered a bullet embedded in the head of said victim who sustained two gunshot wounds, one of which was just a "grazing gunshot wound".&nbsp; The bullet was without a point of exit, he ventilated.<br><br>"Judging from the trajectory of the bullet, he ruled out the infliction of such a wound on a victim lying face down.&nbsp; The kind of wound sustained by Antonio Tepace could be possible if the assailant was in front and the head of the victim was raised upward by about a foot, making it almost perpendicular to the ground, the doctor theorized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>The Sandiganbayan, giving credence to the lone testimony of the prosecution witness and finding the version of the defense too incredible and repugnant to human experience, convicted the accused as charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Hence this petition, with the following assignment of errors:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been an error by the Court in giving weight and evidentiary worth to conjectures and beliefs in find­ing the accused guilty of the offenses charged against him; the decision is not based on the evidence adduced;<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been an error by the Court in utterly ignoring and disregarding all the evidence adduced by the accused;<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been an error by the Court in giving too much weight and reliance on the testimony of Veneranda Lagrimas, the lone witness for the prose­cution whose testimony is never free from serious legal defects; and<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a serious error in the trial of these cases in the sense that the Order of Trial provided for in Section 3, Rule 119 of the New Rules of Court had never been observed, thus de­priving this accused of the right to due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></div><br>The accused begs, in the interest of justice and fair play, that all the evidences presented be fairly and justly evaluated through this sought for judicial review by this Honorable Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The first three errors assigned question the appreciation of the evidence by the trial court while the fourth raises the denial of procedural due process to the accused.<br><br>In his comment, the Solicitor General maintains that petitioner's contentions raise the question of sufficiency of evidence upon which his conviction is predicated and necessarily a question of fact.&nbsp; However, because of the sufficiency of evidence against the accused, said question of fact cannot be transformed into one of law under the exceptions as have been noted by this Court by which a question of fact may be passed upon even under a petition for certiorari.<br><br>Accordingly, the Solicitor General supports the view of respondent Court that the version of petitioner as to how he shot the two victims to death is unworthy of credence, so that the plea of self-defense is not established by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; He adds that there was no denial of due process to the accused as there was no reverse order of trial followed, but on the contrary the order of trial as provided in Section 3, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court was religiously observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The main issue in this petition is whether or not petitioner has convincingly established that he acted in self-defense and/or in fulfillment of duty.&nbsp; Relative thereto, petitioner also claims that he has been deprived of procedural due process.<br><br>We shall deal first with the procedural issue.<br><br>At the initial hearing, the testimony of Veneranda de Lagrimas was interrupted when the accused, through his counsel, admitted that he shot the deceased Tepace and Lerma, but invoked self-defense and fulfillment of duty.&nbsp; The prosecution then moved that the reverse procedure be adopted in view of the admission that the accused shot the deceased.&nbsp; No objection was interposed by the accused or his counsel.&nbsp; After presenting Mrs. Leonida N. Tepace and Mrs. Francisca Lerma Y. Naldo to prove damages and the death and medical certificates of the deceased, the prosecution rested.<br><br>Petitioner claims that the order of trial pro­vided in Section 3, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court was not followed and in support of his claim quotes the ruling of this Court in the case of Alejandro vs. Pepito, as follows:<br><blockquote>"It behooved respondent Judge to have followed the sequence of trial set forth.&nbsp; That procedure observes in the words of Chief Justice Fernando, the 'Mandate of reason and the guarantee of fairness with which due process is identified.' The procedure outlined safeguards and protects the fundamental right of the accused to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.&nbsp; That right is founded on the principle of justice and is intended not to protect the guilty but to prevent as far as human agencies can, the conviction of an innocent person.&nbsp; Indeed, the form of a trial is also a matter of public order and interest; the orderly course of procedure requires that the prosecution shall go forward and present all of its proof in the first instance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>However, this ruling is not applicable in the Case at bar inasmuch as the accused did not object to the procedure followed.&nbsp; In the above-cited case of <i>Alejandro vs. Pepito,</i> this Court also stated:<br><br>"It is true that in the case of <i>U.S. vs. Gaoiran,</i> 17 Phil. 404 (1910), relied upon by the prosecution and the trial Court, the defense had produced its proofs before the prosecution presented its case, and it was held that no substantial rights of the accused were prejudiced.&nbsp; There is one radical difference, however, since in that case, no objection was entered in the Court below to the procedure followed in the presentation of proof.&nbsp; In this case, the change in order of trial made by respondent Judge was promptly and timely objected to by the defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>It should be noted that this procedure is now expressly sanctioned in Section 3(e), Rule 119 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"However, when the accused admits the act or omission charged in the com­plaint or information but interposes a lawful defense, the order of trial may be modified accordingly."<br></blockquote>We shall now deal with the main issue - the sufficiency of petitioner's evidence of self-defense and/or fulfillment of duty.<br><br>After petitioner had presented his evidence, the prosecution presented its sole rebuttal witness, Veneranda Lagrimas, who disputed the testimony of petitioner.&nbsp; At the close of her direct examination she was asked to confirm the truth of the contents of her sworn statement, Exhibit "F", which she did, after which the following took place:<br><blockquote>"PJ PAMARAN<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Cross examination?<br></div><br>ATTY.
