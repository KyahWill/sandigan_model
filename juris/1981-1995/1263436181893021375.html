				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners Leonida Lantican and Joselito de la Peña filed this
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> of
the Court of Appeals affirming the order of the Regional Trial Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dismissing the petition for prohibition filed
by herein petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 25, 1986, Marcos de la Peña died leaving behind him
his wife, private respondent Gaudencia Mercado and daughter Camila de la Peña,
on the one hand, and his common law wife petitioner Leonida Lantican, and
children Joselito (co-petitioner), Abella, Cornelio, Diomedes and Simeon, all
surnamed de la Peña, on the other.  At
the time of his death, he was a tenant on a riceland owned by one Rufina Lim
and was about to be issued a Certificate of Land Transfer.  Rufina Lim chose Gaudencia Mercado as the
successor to the land, which choice was opposed by petitioners.  The controversy as to who had a better right
over the land was brought by Camila de la Peña before the Agrarian Reform
District Office which recommended that the disputants divide the land equally
between them.  However, the Department
of Agrarian Reform through Minister Heherson Alvarez, in an order dated May 13,
1986, ruled that Gaudencia Mercado had the sole right to be the beneficiary of
the Certificate of Land Transfer.</p>

<p class="BODY">To enforce the above order, private respondent Gaudencia Mercado
and Rufina Lim filed Civil Case No. 987-86-C before Branch 36 of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the Regional Trial Court of Laguna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Leonida Lantican and Joselito de la Peña filed
a motion to set aside the above order on the ground that, not only is it
contrary to the actual facts relative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
</span>the land in question but it is not supported by the evidence and the
applicable law.  Moreover, there seemed
to be undue and startling haste <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the
implementation of said order which would, in effect, violate legal and
established rules of procedure.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This </span>motion was dismissed for lack of
merit on February 13, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 16, 1987, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration
of the above order on the ground that the Department of Agrarian Reform had no
jurisdiction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">over </span>the case.  On January 8, 1988, the DAR issued an order
denying the motion<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span>for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lack </span>of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Recourse was subsequently had to the Office of the President
which rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>decision
affirming the DAR orders on May 20, 1988 through Deputy Executive Secretary
Magdangal Elma.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioners filed before the Supreme Court a petition
for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition docketed as G.R. No. 83925, entitled <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Leonida</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"Whether or not it is the Regional Trial Courts taking over
the functions of the defunct Courts of Agrarian Reform that has jurisdiction
over the subject matter of the present case and whether or not petitioners are
in estoppel in not invoking the issue of jurisdiction in the first instance,
i.e., when they filed their motion to set aside the May 13, 1986 order."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On January 30, 1989, the Supreme Court issued a resolution dismissing
the petition, hereunder quoted to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The initial issue in this case was - who should be
substituted for a tenant farmer as beneficiary of a certificate of land
transfer (CTA) in the event of his death - his legitimate widow from whom he
was separated or the 'common law wife' with whom he lived while farming the
land?<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The petitioners question the jurisdiction of the Department of
Agrarian Reform (DAR) to resolve this issue.  The public respondents point out that P.D. 946 vests exclusive authority
in the DAR to ascertain who should be issued CTAs; that 'surviving spouse'
under Republic Act 3844 means the legitimate spouse and not a 'common law
wife', and that the petitioners themselves invoked the jurisdiction of DAR in
their two motions for reconsideration where they asked for affirmative
relief.  Moreover, the decision of an
administrative agency can be elevated for judicial review if a proper case is
filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONSIDERING the failure of the petitioners to show that the public
respondents acted with grave abuse of discretion - the COURT RESOLVED to
DISMISS the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the statement:  "Moreover, the decision of an administrative agency can be elevated
for judicial review if a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span>proper case is filed," petitioners filed before the
Regional Trial Court of Laguna SP Case No. 1364-89 for prohibition with
application for preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of the May
13, 1986 order of the DAR and for its<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span>annulment.  Upon its dismissal by the RTC, it was
appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the same.  The pertinent portion of the decision is
hereby quoted, to wit:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Nonetheless, We are affirming the dismissal of the petition
for prohibition filed by appellant in the lower court on the ground that the
same is barred by prior judgment.  All
the essential elements of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> are present in the instant
case.  It is of record that appellants
filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <u>prohibition</u> against the DAR
officials and herein defendant appellee Mercado with the Supreme Court x x x
questioning the jurisdiction of the DAR to resolve the issue as to who should
be substituted for a tenant farmer as beneficiary of the certificate of land
transfer in the event of his death - his legitimate widow from whom he was
separated or the 'common law wife' with whom he lived while farming the
land?  The Supreme Court resolved to
dismiss the said petition and this judgment has already become final and
executory on February 23, 1989 x x x while the instant case was pending before
the lower court.  In view of the fact
that the instant case has already been the subject of a final judgment of the
Supreme Court in a similar petition between the same parties involving the same
cause of action, the instant petition for prohibition must necessarily be
dismissed."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now come to this Court to assail once again the
jurisdiction of the DAR, arguing that there can be no <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
because one of its elements, i.e., jurisdiction of the tribunal or agency to
decide the case, was lacking.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue regarding the jurisdiction of the DAR has long been
settled by this Court in G.R. No. 83925.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that the issue raised by petitioners in G.R.
No. 83925 was the jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform over the
subject matter of the controversy.  This
Court resolved to dismiss the petition for failure of petitioners to prove
grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondents.  In effect, we affirmed the ruling of the DAR
and its jurisdiction to issue the order.  Noteworthy is our statement finding "that the petitioners
themselves invoked the jurisdiction of the DAR in their two motions for
reconsideration where they asked for affirmative relief." Hence they are
now estopped from assailing such lack of jurisdiction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Our
ruling in <u>Abalos</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
still stands, to wit:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Once a party to a case submits to the jurisdiction of the
Court and participates in the trial on the merits of the case, he cannot
thereafter, upon a judgment unfavorable to his cause, take a total turn about
and say that the condition precedent of compliance with P.D. 1508 has not been
met.  One cannot have the cake and eat
it, too."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, however, petitioners assert for the first time
that they could not be said to have actively participated in the proceedings
before the DAR because the one who filed the Motion to Set Aside the May 13,
1986 order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>not a
lawyer.  It is too late in the day for
them to impugn the jurisdiction of the DAR.  It should have been seasonably raised in the first petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
or in a motion for reconsideration of the resolution rendered by this
Court.  Without taking any
countervailing moves, they simply allowed the decision to become<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>final and executory.  What they did was to file another action in
the trial court to assail once again the jurisdiction of the DAR and to prevent
it from enforcing its order.  We ruled,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Verily, there can be no dispute on the well-entrenched rule
that every litigation must come to an end.  Access to the Court is guaranteed.  But there must be a limit to it.  Once a right has been adjudicated in a valid final judgment, one should
not be granted an unbridled license to come back for another try even at the
risk of legal infirmities to errors that the judgment may contain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the same breath, the prevailing party x x x ought not to be
harassed by subsequent suits.  For, if
endless litigations were to be encouraged, unscrupulous litigants will multiply
in number to the detriment of the administration of justice."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the Court of
Appeals that the action of petitioners has been barred by <u>res</u> j<u>udicata</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In filing this petition, petitioners desperately tried to
circumvent our final resolution and delay the execution of the decision of the
DAR to the prejudice of private respondents.  We likewise frown upon the filing of the petition for prohibition with
the RTC to enjoin the execution of the DAR order after this Court has
pronounced that the DAR had not gravely abused its discretion in issuing the
same.  It is tantamount to asking a
lower court to review the decision of the Highest Tribunal of the land.  We cannot sanction such procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed decision is hereby AFFIRMED and
this petition DENIED for lack <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>merit.  This decision is immediately executory.  With costs against petitioners.</p>
