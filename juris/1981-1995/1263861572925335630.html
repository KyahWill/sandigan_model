				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision dated <st1:date year="1981" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1981</st1:date> of the Court of
Appeals in CA-­G.R. No. 66145-R, entitled "Arturo L. Rodriguez vs.
Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Guasch</span>," affirming the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, which ordered the
petitioner to vacate the private respondent's property but set aside the order
for reimbursement of the petitioner's insurance premiums and expenses for
repairs of the building.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, Arturo L. Rodriguez, owned a building
which stood on his 1,277-square-meter land on <st1:address><st1:street>Samson
  Road</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:city></st1:address>
City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1968</st1:date>,
the petitioner leased Rodriguez's land and building for a nominal monthly
rental under a contract entitled "Lease of Land" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A) <span class="GramE">wherein</span> the petitioner bound herself to build
within three (3) years from the date of the contract, a new building on the land
which would become the property of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, after
the expiration of twenty (20) years from the date of their agreement, without
any obligation to reimburse the lessee <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provisions of the contract read
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">"3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That notwithstanding the existing building,
the LESSEE may have same demolished and constructed in lieu thereof a <u>new
two-storey concrete reinforced building worth not less than P200,000 as shown
by the </u></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

hereof;<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">"4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the said building be constructed in
accordance with the government rules and regulations with no less than one
first class toilet and bath on the second floor and on the ground floor one of
first class toilet and bath and another of the second class and made strictly
in accordance with the specification stated therein;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">"5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This building shall be finished not later
than three (3) years from date hereof and the LESSOR or his legal representative
may from time to time check on the construction and any deviation from the plan
and specification that may be found shall be changed and so made strictly in
pursuance to (sic) the agreement herein." <span class="GramE">(Emphasis
supplied; Record on Appeal, pp. 8-9; pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">They also agreed that the new building would be insured at the
lessee's expense for the benefit of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>:</p>

<blockquote><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">"9<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span> building </i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

LESSEE </i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">at </span>her expense for P50,000 and in case of damage or fire the </i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">proceeds
shall be </span><u>payable to the LESSOR</u> </i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">herein and in which amount will
be expended for the repair of the damaged building.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The insurance Company underwriting must be
acceptable to the LESSEE herein." <span class="GramE">(Underlining ours;
Record on Appeal, pp. 9-10.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The parties further agreed that failure of the lessee to pay
three successive monthly rentals, or any violation of the lease <span class="GramE">covenants,</span> would be a ground for the cancellation of the
lease, in which event, the building and all the improvements introduced by the
lessee would be forfeited to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> without
payment of indemnity to the lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lessee failed to comply with her obligation to construct a
new two-storey reinforced concrete building in accordance with the plan (Ex.
A-1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What she built were three (3)
cheap <span class="SpellE">accessoria</span>-type tenements of wood and stone
worth only P50<span class="GramE">,000</span>, and completely different from the
approved plans and specifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, although she did insure the building, the beneficiary of the
policies was herself or the "Mercedes Commercial Enterprises and
Automotive Services," (p. 74, Record on Appeal) instead of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez's
demands for the delivery of the fire insurance policies to him were ignored by
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1977</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
advised her in writing of the termination of the lease (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
D).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1977</st1:date>,
Rodriguez filed a complaint for rescission of the lease contract and to recover
possession of the leased premises, with damages in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the action, arguing that the
Court of First Instance did not have jurisdiction over the case, as it was
essentially one for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, hence, cognizable by
an inferior court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After her motion to
dismiss was denied, she filed an answer denying that she had violated any
conditions of the lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 8, 1979, the trial court rendered a decision finding
that the petitioner (then the defendant) violated two conditions of the lease,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) her obligation to construct
a new two-storey reinforced concrete building in accordance with the plan (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A-1); and, (2) her obligation to
procure insurance for the benefit of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
plaintiff Rodriguez.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
declared the plaintiff entitled to cancel the lease contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision
reads:</p>

<blockquote><i>“WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the lease
contract entered into by the parties on May 27, 1978 (sic) terminated and
cancelled as of February 1, 1977 and all improvements constructed and existing
on the leased premises are hereby declared as belonging</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> to the plaintiff from the aforementioned
date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant is directed to
immediately deliver the possession of these improvements to the possession of
the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is further required
to deliver immediately to the plaintiff all the rentals she received
corresponding for the period from February 1, 1977 up to actual delivery less
all rentals she paid to plaintiff for the land, as well as all expenses
[incurred] by her for the procurement of the insurance coverage and for the repair
of the buildings from February 1, 1977 up to the present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant is furthermore condemned to pay
plaintiff the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> as attorney's fees and
P1,000 as liquidated damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
counterclaim is dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs in this instance against defendant."</span> <span class="GramE">(p. 10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed, the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span>
appeal being limited only to the portion of the judgment ordering him to
reimburse the lessee for the insurance premium paid and for repairs made on the
building after <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1981</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote><i>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby modified
in the sense that plaintiff-appellant should not be required to reimburse
defendant-appellant's expenses incurred by the latter for the procurement of
the insurance coverage and for the repair of the building from </i><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="2"><i>February </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 16.0pt">1, </span>1977</i></st1:date><i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">all </span>other
respects, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against
defendant-appellant." <span class="GramE">(p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">48, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After her motion for reconsideration of the decision was denied
by the Appellate Court in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1981</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Guasch</span> filed
this petition for review wherein she assigned eight (8) errors against the
Appellate Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the resolution
of those alleged errors hinge upon the lone factual issue of whether or not she
violated the conditions of the lease agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court's finding that she did is supported by the
evidence, and its conclusion that her <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> was
entitled to rescind the lease contract with damages is in accord with
applicable laws and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1191 of the Civil Code provides that "the injured
party may choose between the fulfillment and rescission of the ob<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">l</span>igation, with payment of damages in
either case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may also seek
rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become
impossible." The rescission of the contract as sought by the private
respondent is therefore legally justified (<span class="SpellE">Siy</span> vs.
Court of Appeals, 138 SCRA 536; <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span>-Simon vs. <span class="SpellE">Adamos</span>, 131 SCRA 439).</p>

<p class="BODY">The court of first instance, now the regional trial court, had
jurisdiction over the complaint for rescission of the lease contract and, for a
judicial declaration that as of <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1977</st1:date>, when the contract was terminated, the plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>) became the owner of the building constructed by the
defendant on the leased premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint neither alleged forcible entry by the defendant upon the premises nor
illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> of the same, for as pointed out by
the Court of Appeals, Rodriguez was not yet the owner of the building occupied
by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the action did
not come within the jurisdiction of an inferior court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Courts of first instance (now regional trial
courts) have original jurisdiction in civil actions involving the title to or
possession of real property or any interest therein except actions for forcible
entry and unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> (Sec. 44[b], Judiciary
Law and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Sec. </span>19[2] of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is denied for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appealed judgment is affirmed
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, </span>with costs against the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
