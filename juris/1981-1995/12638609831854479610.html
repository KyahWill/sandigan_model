<p class="BODY">The facts are undisputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners were charged with violation of Section 3(c) of Republic Act
No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practice Act, as

and was docketed as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Civil Case No.

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition where it is alleged that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> committed a grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
motions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1989</st1:date>,

urgent motion of petitioners for the issuance of a temporary restraining order

comment thereon, granted the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation in support of
the stand taken by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Crespo</u></span><u> vs. </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Mogul</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in relation to the jurisdiction of the competent courts over such cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We ruled that while the public prosecutor has
the sole direction and control in the prosecution of offenses, once the
complaint or information is filed in court, the court thereby acquires jurisdiction
over the case and all subsequent actions that may be taken by the public
prosecutor in relation to the disposition of the case must be subject to the
approval of the said court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In such an instance, before a re-investigation of the case may be
conducted by the public prosecutor, the permission or consent of the court must
be secured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And if after such
reinvestigation the prosecution finds a cogent basis to withdraw the
information or otherwise cause the dismissal of the case, such proposed course
of action must be addressed to the sound discretion of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the past, a government prosecutor could practically impose his
judgment or opinion on the court as it was recognized that the prosecution of
offenses is his exclusive domain which resulted then and again in a clash or
conflict <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>opinion between the
prosecutors and the courts to the detriment of the administration of
justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a situation may no longer
be possible since <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Crespo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It
is the court that has now the final say on any subsequent disposition or action
once the case is brought before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only instance when the appellate court should stay the hand
of the trial court in such cases is when it is shown that the trial court acted
without jurisdiction or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in excess </span>of
its jurisdiction or otherwise committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting
to such lack or excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the petitioners are public officers charged with
having violated Section 3(c) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, for evident
bad faith and manifest partiality in enforcing the writ of execution in Civil
Case No. 4047 against a Mustang car registered in the name of Leticia Acosta-<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> (complainant) who is not the judgment debtor thereby
causing undue injury to said complainant and giving unwarranted benefits to the
judgment creditor in said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reinvestigation of the criminal case by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, he found evidence tending to show that the sale
of said car to the complainant by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, the judgment debtor, was a sham intended to defraud
his creditors; that the deed of absolute sale which ostensibly was executed
before a notary public on June 18, 1983 appeared to be fictitious inasmuch as
the entry of the document in the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> register of
said notary public on said date referred to a catering contract of other
parties; that the certificate of registration of the car was issued to
complainant only on June 13, 1984 which showed that the document of sale was
actually executed only on or about the same date, that is, seven (7) days after
<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> received copy of
the adverse decision in Civil Case No. 4047 on June 8, 1984; and that upon the
execution of the judgment, the car was found in the possession of Alvin, the
son of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, who
admitted that the car belonged to his father by showing the receipt of its
repair<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in the name of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the basis of the motion for
withdrawal of the information of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In denying said motion the public respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
stated in its resolution dated June 29, 1988 that the issue in the criminal
case was not so much whether the car was owned by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> or Leticia <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> but
whether it was rightly seized, that is, whether or not it was attended with
partiality as to extend unwarranted benefits to the judgment creditor, quoting
the resolution of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> after a preliminary
investigation for the filing of the information:</p>

<blockquote>"In the implementation of the writ of execution it is the
bounden duty of the sheriffs to ascertain the true owner of the property sought
to be levied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that they have
not seen the Certificate of Registration showing that the real owner is Leticia
Acosta-<span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, they could have easily verified the same
at the Land Transportation Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their contention that they were informed by Alvin <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
and the <span class="GramE">neighbors of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> (the judgment debtor) that the latter is the owner of
the car is</span> clearly hearsay evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The best evidence is the document itself -- the Certificate of
Registration shown to the respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their conclusion that the transfer of ownership to Leticia <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, even if true, may be simulated to defraud the judgment
creditor is plainly untenable, for the same should be addressed to the sound
discretion of a competent court in an action for annulment of the Deed of Sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondents are aware that the complainant is not a party to
the civil case filed by the creditor against spouses <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
and Lydia <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> and that a writ of execution cannot be
implemented validly against one who is not a party to the action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these, coupled with the undue haste in
which the levy on the Mustang car was made without first ascertaining the true
owner thereof demonstrate quite convincingly the evident bad faith and manifest
partiality of the respondents, thereby giving unwarranted benefits to the
judgment creditor to the damage and prejudice of the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> "</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although at the
reinvestigation, the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> was persuaded that in
fact the sale of the car to Leticia <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> was
fraudulent, this did not necessarily clear petitioners of the aforesaid Anti-Graft
charge against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still the burden is
on the petitioners to establish that they acted in good faith in proceeding
with the execution on the car even as they were presented evidence tending to
show it did not belong to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
anymore.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1988</st1:date> denying the motion for reconsideration filed by
petitioner, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> held that the arguments
adduced relate to matters of defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court finds that the public respondent did not err in denying the
motion for withdrawal of the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">By <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the same token, the
denial of the motion to suspend the criminal proceedings on the ground of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of a prejudicial question in Civil Case No. 5307
is well taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of
prejudicial question comes into play usually in a situation where a civil
action and a criminal action are both pending and there exists in the former an
issue which </span>must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be preemptively
resolved before the criminal </span>action may proceed, because whatsoever the
issue raised in the civil action is resolved would be determinative <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span><u> et <span class="SpellE">jure</span></u> of
the guilt or innocence of the accused in the criminal case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, as correctly held by public respondent, the pending
civil case for the annulment of the sale of the car to Leticia <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> (Civil Case No. 5307) is not determinative of the guilt
or innocence of the petitioners for the acts allegedly committed by them in
seizing the car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if in the civil
action it is ultimately resolved that the sale was null and void, it does not
necessarily follow that the seizure of the car was rightfully undertaken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The car was registered in the name of Leticia
<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> six (6) months before the seizure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Until the nullity of the sale is declared by
the courts, the same is presumptively valid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, petitioners must demonstrate that the seizure was not attended by
manifest bad faith in order to clear <span class="GramE">themselves</span> of the
charge in the criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit and
the restraining order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="6">June <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">6, </span>1989</st1:date> is hereby lifted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
