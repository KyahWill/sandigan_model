				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In an Amended Information that was filed by the Assistant City Fiscal
of Cagayan de Oro with Branch 18 of the Regional Trial Court of <span style="">Misamis </span>Oriental, Romeo Alerta, Jr.
was charged with violation of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425
(Sale of Prohibited Drugs), committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about February 1, 1988 at more or <span style="">less </span>2:15 o'clock p.m.., at Main gate
of Philippine Packing Corporation fronting the National Highway, Bugo, Cagayan
de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the above-named accused, without lawful authority, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously <span style="">sell
and </span>distribute one (1) tea bag of dried marijuana leaves to a CI, not
knowing that he is <span style="">a </span>CI,
marijuana being a prohibited drug, well-knowing that <span style="">it is prohibited, </span>by then and there receiving P10.00 cash (marked
money) from the said CI as payment of said marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to and in violation of Section 4, Article II, R.A.
6425 otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972." (p. 7, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 88-55.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon his arraignment on April 25, 1988, the accused, assisted by
counsel, pleaded not guilty.  Trial
thereupon ensued where the prosecution presented Bernabe Aranga, NBI agent, CIC
Anuario Olaco and Cpl. Emilio de Guzman as witnesses.  On the other hand, the defense presented as witnesses Zaldy
Sarenas, Felipe Adarne and the accused Romeo Alerta, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding that the accused had committed the crime as charged in
the Information, the trial court, on July 19, 1988, rendered a judgment of
conviction.  The Decision disposes:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused ROMEO ALERTA, JR.,
guilty as charged of violation of Section 4, Article II, Republic Act No. 6425,
as amended by P.D. No. 1675, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of LIFE
IMPRISONMENT and to pay a fine of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) and the
costs.  The marijuana (Exhibit B) is
confiscated and forfeited in favor of the Government and shall be turned over
to the Dangerous Drug Board for proper disposal without delay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (p. 45, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused raises the following assignments of error in this
appeal, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE PROSECUTION
MISERABLY FAILED TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT BECAUSE:</blockquote>

Accused-appellant's brief)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts, as established
by the evidence and summarized by the trial court in its decision, are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On February 1, 1988, at about 2:15 o'clock in the afternoon,
a composite anti-narcotics team was in Zone 2, Barangay Bugo, Cagayan de Oro
City.  The team was composed of S/Sgt.
Rey Bernal, PA; Patrolwoman Susan Tuseco, INP; Cpl. Emilio de Guzman, PA; and <span style="">CIC Anuario </span>J. Olaco, PC.  They were on a 'buy-bust operation’.  Also with the Narcom elements were four
confidential informants (CI) whose identities have not <span style="">been </span>disclosed for security reasons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">At </span>that time
and place aforementioned an unnamed confidential agent posing as buyer, handed
a ten-peso bill to the accused Romeo Alerta, Jr.  In turn Romeo Alerta, Jr. gave to the CI a tea bag of
marijuana.  The CI then gave the 'one
tea bag' to one of the companions in the team.  (tsn, 13-18, May 17, 1988).  Prosecution witnesses CIS Olaco, Cpl. Emilio de Guzman and the other
members of the team were only about four or five meters away.  CIC Olaco and Cpl. de Guzman testified that
they saw the CI hand the money to the accused and also the accused when he
handed the tea bag of marijuana to the former.  (tsn. 19, 44 id).  After Alerta
had given the marijuana to the CI, Alerta went inside the house.  It was outside that house that the 'buy and
sale' was made.  Thereupon the Narcom
agents followed Alerta into the house, introduced themselves as Narcom agents
and arrested not only Romeo Alerta, Jr. but also Eduardo Saarenas, Roel
Ravidas, Noel Ravidas, and Victorino Casino.  (tsn, 21, 30, 37, id).  The house
where Alerta went to after the sale of the marijuana is identified by the
prosecution witness Olaco as that of Saarenas (tsn, 18, 21, 24, id) and as that
of Ravidas, by prosecution witness Cpl. De Guzman (tsn, 36, 37, 44, 46, 48,
id).  The fact is that Romeo Alerta, Jr.
went inside the house near  which the 'buy-bust
operation' had taken place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused Romeo Alerta, Jr. and the several others arrested
inside the house were next brought by the police officers to the Anti-Narcotics
Command Unit Office in Cagayan de Oro and there investigated.  (tsn, 22, May 17, 1988) The marijuana
subject of the present prosecution was submitted to the NBI, Cagayan de Oro,
for laboratory examination to determine its contents as to prohibited drug on
February 2, 1988, upon written request (Exh. A) dated February 1, 1988 of Capt.
Michael Silva, Jr. C.C. of the 10th Narcotics Command Unit, which was
personally delivered by CIC Anuario Olaco.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The specimen as received by prosecution witness, NBI Forensic
Chemist Bernabe Arenga, is described as 'dried flowering tops' suspected to be
marijuana contained in a transparent plastic bag wrapped <span style="">in a piece </span>of paper markings:   Re:   ROMEO
ALERTA y AGWIN, 16 years old, single, a resident of Zone 2, Bugo, Cagayan de
Oro City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon microscopic, chemical and chromatographic examinations
conducted on the aforementioned (0.6075 gram) specimen, it gave 'POSITIVE
RESULTS FOR MARIJUANA' (Exhibit C).  Bernabe Arenga who conducted the tests testified on his Dangerous Drugs
Report No. DDM-88-21 (NEMRO), marked as Exhibit C." (pp. <span style="">41-43, Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused denied having sold marijuana to any person <span style="">whomsoever </span>in the afternoon of February
1, 1988.  He stressed that he has not
met any person outside the house of Zaldy Saarenas on his way to the latter's
house to take his bath therein, and that he was inside the house of Zaldy
Saarenas when he was arrested and while he was picking up a basin in the
kitchen to be used in bathing.  The
testimony of the accused was corroborated by defense witness Zaldy Saarenas.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave credence to the prosecution's version of the
incident.  It gave scant consideration
to the accused's pretense of innocence and found that the peace officers acted
without any ill-will or corrupt motive to trump-up a charge against the accused
who was a complete stranger to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that his guilt has not been established beyond
reasonable doubt.  He underscores the
fact that the civilian informant was not made to take the witness stand and
maintains that the non-presentation rendered a fatal blow to the case of the
prosecution and is a clear suppression of evidence which if produced would be
adverse, We do not agree.  Admittedly,
the civilian informant would be a highly competent witness; being himself the
poseur-buyer.  However, his <span style="">testimony is </span><span style="">not indispensable </span>in view of the
testimony of the two (2) prosecution witnesses, CIC Anuarco Olaco and Cpl.
Emilio de Guzman, who were members of the Narcotic Command team which conducted
the buy-bust operation, categorically declaring that they saw the appellant
sell one tea-bag of dried marijuana leaves (Exh. B) to the confidential
informant while the latter handed the P10.00 marked money.  (tsn, May 17, 1988, pp. 17-18).  They testified further that they were about
four (4) to five (5) meters away from the place where the illegal transaction
was conducted.  They positively
established that after the drug deal was completed, the appellant went inside
the house of a certain Zaldy Saarenas while the <span style="">confidential informant </span>approached one of the Narcom agents and
handed to him the dried marijuana leaves placed in a plastic sachet.  (TSN, May 17, 1988, pp. 18-20).  Thereupon, they immediately proceeded inside
the house and, after introducing themselves as Narcom agents, they arrested the
appellant (Ibid., p. 20).</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the matter of presenting witnesses for the People is
the prerogative of the fiscal.  <span style="">(People v. </span>Adiza, 164 SCRA 643; People
v. Solomon, <span style="">166 SCRA 767).  </span>Apparently, it was found unnecessary
to present the informer because there was sufficient evidence to establish the
case of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant next contends that the marked money allegedly paid to
him was not offered in evidence.  As
such, the <span style="">sale </span>was not proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had the opportunity to rule on this issue recently in
the cases of People v. Tejada, GR No. 81520, February 21, 1989, and People v.
Rodriguez (172 SCRA 742).</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The fact that the appellant returned with the amount of
marijuana corresponding to the offered price, suffices to constitute, if not
sale, then delivery or giving away to another and distribution of the prohibited
drug punishable under Section 4, Article II of Rep. Act 6425 x x x.  So long as the marijuana actually given by
the appellant was presented before the lower court, the absence of the marked
money does not create a hiatus in the prosecution's evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact, then, that the money given to the appellant was not
presented in court does not militate against the prosecution’s case where there
is, as in this case, an unrebutted testimony of eyewitnesses who saw the actual
handing over of the marijuana in exchange for the money.  (People v. Marco Polo, 147 SCRA 551).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's pretense that he was not engaged in the drug deal as
he was inside the house of Zaldy Saarenas about to take a bath when he was
arrested cannot overcome the overwhelming evidence of the prosecution.  His allegation that he was arrested inside
the house completely jibes with the prosecution's version that he went inside
the house after he had sold one tea-bag of dried marijuana leaves to the
confidential informant.  So well-entrenched
is the rule that greater weight is given to the positive testimony of
prosecution witnesses than to accused-appellant's denials.  (People v. de Jesus, 145 SCRA 521)</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, no ill motives were imputed to the prosecution
witnesses who happened to be NARCOM agents.  They are presumed to have regularly performed their duties in the
absence of proof to the contrary.  Their
testimonies, therefore, deserve full faith and credit.  (People v. Rodriguez, supra) There is,
likewise, no question from the records that the denials put forth by the
appellant did not satisfactorily overcome the positive testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses that the appellant was positively identified as a seller
of prohibited drugs and that the tea bag taken from him actually contained
marijuana leaves.</p>

<p class="BODY">All things considered, We find that the guilt of the appellant
has been established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
