Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, BLANDINO SAN MIGUEL, ALBERT ADIN,
JR. and JOHN DOE alias BALUT were accused of homicide in an information which
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 2nd day of October, 1972, in <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Quezon</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>City, Philippines, the above-named
accused, conspiring together, confederating with and mutually helping one
another, did, then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully
and feloniously with intent to kill and w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ithout
</span>any justifiable motive, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">attack, </span>assault
and employ personal violence upon the person of one LUIS TARUM Y BINAG by then
and there stabbing him, thereby inflicting upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">him serious </span>and mortal wounds which was the direct and immediate
cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> y <span class="SpellE">Binag</span>, in such amount as
may be awarded to them under the provisions of the Civil Code." (<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, p. 1.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Only <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> was arrested and
tried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court pronounced the
following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the defendant <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
San Miguel guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and although
there is one aggravating circums­tance of treachery without any mitigating
circumstance to offset the same, the Court hereby merely imposes a penalty of
RECLU­SION PERPETUA instead of DEATH.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court hereby further sentences the defendant <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel to pay to the heirs of the deceased
P12,000.00 as indemnity for the death of Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>,
P10,000.00 as moral damages, and P99,360.00 as loss of earning, without any
subsidiary liability in case of insolvency, and to pay one-third of the
costs." (<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, pp. 49-50.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under consideration is the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
from the foregoing judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution as summarized by the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">court</span> is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 6:00 o'clock on the morning of October 2, 1972, Luis
<span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> was sleeping under a mosquito net inside his
house located at the squatter's area at 7th Street, Broadway, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
wife Lolita <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> was in front of the stairway.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly the three defendants arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of them, Junior, went up the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He suddenly stabbed Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>
and dragged him outside the house where the two other defendants <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel and “<span class="SpellE">Balut</span>”
were waiting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The three defendants
simultaneously attacked Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> with a club and
bladed weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
San Miguel stabbed Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> three times and also
clubbed him three times at the back of his neck with an iron pipe three feet
long and one inch in diameter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of
the stab wounds inflicted by <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel
landed above the heart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel was clubbing Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>,
Junior and <span class="SpellE">Balut</span> were also simultaneously stabbing
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the attack "<span class="SpellE">Balut</span>" said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Nobody must interfere!"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After inflicting several wounds on Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>
all the defendants ran away together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lolita <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>, wife of Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>,
brought her husband to the hospital, but Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>
died before he arrived at the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All in all the deceased received nine stab wounds, and abrasions and
other incised wounds found by Dr. Prospero <span class="SpellE">Cabanayan</span>,
who conducted a postmortem examination of the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit "A").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death was 'hemorrhage, severe,
secondary to stab wounds, multiple'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibit "A-1").</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the time of his death Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>
was in good health, earning P7.50 a day as security guard and he used to
deliver every fifteen days to his wife the amount of P115.00." (<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>, pp. 42-43.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> who
testified alone in his defense claimed that:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 6:00 o'clock on the morning of October 2, 1972, he (<span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel) went to the house of Junior to ask
whether the latter would be reporting for work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Junior did not answer but instead he went down from their house and went
to the house of <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> which is only a few meters
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, Junior went out of
the house of <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> carrying with him a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After arming himself with a bolo, which he
took from the house of <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>, Junior went <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">next </span>to the house of another neighbor,
Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> y <span class="SpellE">Binag</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel
followed Junior but stayed only at the door of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
San Miguel heard a commotion inside the house of Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After sometime Junior fell downstairs from
the house of Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> followed
him downstairs with a bolo in his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> reached the ground he <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> Junior who was not hurt because he could parry the
blow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Luis </span><span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> and Junior grappled for the
bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While they were grappling for the
possession of the bolo the wife of Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel to pacify them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> went
near them and called to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>'That
is enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is enough.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Apparently, Luis was startled by the voice of <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel and so he began attacking the latter
with his bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was not </span>hit because he ran and
sought cover under a neighboring house where he got hold of a pipe and then
returned to Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
emerged from under the house Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> again
attacked <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> with a bolo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">which </span>the latter parried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After parrying the blow <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> struck Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> with the iron pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">persisted in attacking <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> </span>who
thereupon inflicted a second blow on the neck of Luis <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Tarum</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">, who thereafter felt</span> groggy and proceeded in a weak condition
to his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the way to his house
"<span class="SpellE">Balut</span>", who is a brother of Junior stabbed
Luis, who immediately fell upon receiving the stab wound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then "<span class="SpellE">Balut</span>"
picked up Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum's</span> bolo which had fallen to the
ground and gave it to Junior.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter
"<span class="SpellE">Balut</span>" and Junior repeatedly stabbed Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span> San Miguel,
he immediately instructed the wife of Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> to
call the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he went to a <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> officer's house to report the incident." (<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, pp. 43-44.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant admits having struck the deceased twice with an
iron pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he claims that he did so
in self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His claim is not
impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the appellant he started out as a peace-maker
between the deceased and Junior only to become one of the protago­nists
afterwards.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here is his testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>[Atty. <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagarda</span>]</blockquote>

<blockquote>What did you do while
you saw they were grappling for the bolo?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At that moment the wife of Luis was shouting and she was asking for help
and for me to pacify them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did you do when you heard the wife of Luis calling for help?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
went near them and then I called Luis, saying, that is enough, that is enough.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
when you said calling the attention of Luis, that is enough, that is enough,
what happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maybe
he was a little bit surprised when I called him because I was quite near him
and he tried to strike me with the bolo which he got from Junior.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were
you hit when Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> struck you with the bolo?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir, I was able to retreat and went inside the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
you retreated, what did <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">you </span>do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was able to get hold of a pipe under the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whose house was that
where you got a pipe?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
do not know, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">T</span>agarda</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then
after that, after holding that pipe, what did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
went out, sir, from under the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
going out from under the house, what happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
<span class="SpellE">boloed</span> me again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were
you hit?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">No, </span>sir, I was able to parry it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So I hit him at the head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Witness indicating).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Interpreter:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The witness
indicating the back of his head.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you hit him at his head, what happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None,
sir.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When I hit him on the head, after
hitting him on the head he faced me again, and struck me again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that moment I again hit him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where was the second blow
land when you hit him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
at the head, sir.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Witness
indicating)." (TSN, Sept. 25, 1974, pp. 2-3.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If it is true that the deceased turned on the appellant, what the
latter should have done was simply to run and get away as far as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he got hold of a pipe, confronted
the deceased and struck him twice with the pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances do not paint a picture of
self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the trial court said, "after
considering all the facts and the circumstances of the case, as well as the
demeanor or the witnesses during the trial, [the court] is more inclined to
accept the version of Lolita <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span>, who was the lone
witness for the prosecution." We have no reason to disturb this factual
finding of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> which was in a better position to
appreciate the credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant was charged with homicide only but the trial court
adjudged him guilty of murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant complains with justifica­tion that the trial court treated him
harshly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rationalized its action as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The legal question is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What crime has been committed?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While treachery obviously attended the commission of the offense, it can
be taken into account only as a generic aggravating circumstance because it is
not alleged in the information.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, it will be observed that while in the information,
the fiscal designated the crime as Homicide, yet, the information alleges acts which
show that the defendants took advantage of superior strength and that the crime
was committed with the aid of armed men, circumstances which qualify the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">killing </span>into Murder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the opinion of the Court, the acts alleged in the information
sufficiently show that at least the defendants took advantage of superior
strength.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The averment that the three
accused <u>conspired together</u>, <u>confederated with</u> and <u>mutually
helped</u> one another in inflicting the stab wounds sufficiently alleges the qualifying
circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength and that the killing was
done with the aid of armed men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
sufficiently allege 'abuse of superior strength,’ or 'with the aid of armed
men,' the information does not have to use the language of the statute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Different words or phrases equally describing
the same facts may be used." (<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
pp. 46-47.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The People agree with the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The People brief submits:</p>

<blockquote>"The words 'conspiring together, confederating with and
mutually helping one another' contained in the information, simply convey the
allegation of conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, as
the defense rightly argues, 'every charge of cons­piracy to commit homicide,
would result in a charge of murder'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There should be some other allegation in the information showing that
the accuse did take advantage of superior strength and/or with the aid of armed
men." (Brief, p. 9.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The common opinion of the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has jurisprudential support in <u>People vs. Bautista</u>, L-23303, May 20, 1969,
28 SCRA 184, which held that if the circumstance of abuse of superior strength
is not alleged in the information, it may only be considered as a generic
aggravating circumstance in the imposition of the corresponding penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See also <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Jovellano</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>L-32421, March 27, 1974, 56 SCRA
156.)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not err when it concluded that there was
abuse of superiority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For as the People
say:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering that three assailants, all armed with bladed
weapons, simultaneously and repeatedly stabbed and clubbed the defenseless
victim, the killing was thereby attended by the aggravating circumstances of
abuse of superior strength and with the aid of armed men.” (Brief, p. 8.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither did the trial court err in awarding damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The in­demnity of P12,000.00 is
jurisprudential; the award of P10,000.00 as moral damages is justified by the
Civil Code; and the award of P99,360.00 for loss of earnings was arrived as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the civil liability, it appears that at the
time of the death of Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> he was 25 years old,
and that he used to turn over to his wife the amount of P115.00 every fifteen
days or P230.00 a month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had Luis <span class="SpellE">Tarum</span> not been killed by the defendants, his remaining life
expectancy is computed by the following formula:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>2/3 (80 minus 25, which is the age of the
deceased at the time of his death), which gives 36 years as the remaining life
expectancy of the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, by his
untimely death, his family lost an expected earning in the amount of
P99,360.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Villa-<span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, L­-25499, February 18, 1970)." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
</span>p. 49.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the trial court is modified in
that the appellant shall be convicted for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
