<p class="BODY">Between March 1 to April 4, 1979, one hundred twenty six (126) 
cases were filed by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> with the respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, charging certain officials of Region 
VII of the Ministry of Public Highways, one of whom is the herein petitioner 
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> as the then Chief Accountant I, 
together with certain officials and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City Highways Engineering District (hereinafter called 
"<span class="SpellE">DanaoHED</span>" for brevity) and certain contractors and 
suppliers, with having committed the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> 
thru falsification of public documents.</p>
<p class="BODY">All the 126 <span class="SpellE">informations</span> are identically 
worded except as to persons, dates, amounts and materials/supplies 
involved.<span>&nbsp; </span>They alleged that on several occasions, covered by the 
period <span>from </span>January 1 to July <span>3, </span>1978, the accused 
government officials, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bagasao</span>, 
Asst. Director, Region VII, Ministry of Public Highways; <span class="SpellE">Escano</span>, Finance Officer; <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span>, 
Chief Accountant; <span class="SpellE">Preagido</span>, Assistant Chief 
Accountant, all of the same office; <span class="SpellE">Sabarre</span>, District 
Engineer of the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City Highway Engineering 
District; <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span>, Asst. District Engineer; <span class="SpellE">Neis</span>, Assistant District Engineer; <span class="SpellE">Andrino</span>, Senior Civil Engineer; <span class="SpellE">Alberio</span>, Civil Engineer; <span class="SpellE">Masecampo</span>, Administrative Officer; <span class="SpellE">Pisao</span>, Chief Accountant; <span class="SpellE">Lucenas</span>, 
Property Custodian, all of the same office and Toledo, District Auditor of the 
Commission on Audit (COA, for short) assigned to the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City Highway Engineering District, taking advantage of 
their official positions and conniving with the private suppliers who are their 
co-accused in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> pertaining to them, 
namely:<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gabison</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jariol</span>, Nunez and Delos Angeles, committed <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of public and commercial documents 
in <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City, by willfully, unlawfully, and 
feloniously falsifying the following public documents, namely:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Letters of Advice of Allotment which will hereinafter be referred to as 
<span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>, Requests for Obligation of Allotment, Abstract 
of Sealed Quotations, Purchase Orders, Delivery Receipts, Reports of Inspection 
and General Vouchers, by making it appear that Region VII of the Ministry of 
Public Highways regularly issued <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City Highway Engineering District for the purchase of 
gravel surface course, except Case No. 069 which is for the delivery of <span>33 
</span>pails of <span class="SpellE">reflectorized</span> traffic paint and 24 
pieces of bridge approach warning devices for the repair or shoulder repair of 
the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> North <span class="SpellE">Hagnaya</span> Wharf 
Road which will hereinafter be called the Wharf Road, that the Requests for 
Obligation of Allotment were prepared in favor of the lowest bidder and that the 
ordered construction materials were duly delivered and inspected when, in truth 
<span>and </span>in fact, as all the accused knew, the foregoing were false and 
incorrect, and that because of these falsifications the accused were able to 
collect from the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City Highway Engineering 
District the amounts alleged in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P6,277,018.00 in payment of the non-existent 
deliveries and, once in possession of said amounts, the accused misappropriated, 
converted and misapplied the said amounts for their own personal needs to the 
damage and prejudice of the government in the said amount of P6,277,018.00.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>By agreement of the parties, all these 126 cases, with the 
exception of four (4), were jointly heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date month="11" day="29" year="1979"><span>November 29, 1979</span></st1:date><span>, a single decision 
in all the 126 cases was promulgated by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Except for the two accused, 
Milagros <span class="SpellE">Pisao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dulcisimo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Lucenas</span>, who were discharged to become state witnesses 
and accused <span class="SpellE">Rocilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Neis</span>, 
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Alberio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Enestorio</span> 
</span><span class="SpellE">Sabarre</span> who were acquitted of the charges 
against them, the rest of the accused, including herein petitioner, were 
convicted in all the cases they were respectively charged and were sentenced in 
each case to an indeterminate penalty ranging from eight (8) years, eight (8) 
months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> mayor</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 
</span>as minimum to ten (10) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 
mayor</span> as maximum, to pay a <span>fine of P3,500.00 </span>and to 
indemnify the government of the amounts defrauded.</p>
<p class="BODY">From this decision, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration 
but same was denied, hence the instant petition impugning the decision on both 
legal and factual grounds.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the legal issue, petitioner assails the constitutionality of 
the law creating the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> contending that the 
same violates his rights under the equal protection, due process and <span style="font-style: italic;">ex post </span><em>facto</em> clauses of the 
constitution.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner's aforesaid contention is devoid of merit.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>These are the same legal issues raised in the case of <em>Nuñez vs. 
Sandiganbayan</em>, Nos. <span class="GramE">L-50581 - 50617, </span><st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1982"><span class="GramE">January 30, 
1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 111 SCRA 433, which was the first case 
to put to the most severe test the constitutionality of the decree creating the 
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Speaking thru 
former Chief Justice Fernando, this Court held that the decree creating the 
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is <span class="SpellE">contitutional</span> and it does not violate the equal protection, 
due process and <em>ex post facto</em> clauses of the Constitution.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This doctrine was reiterated in the cases of <span class="SpellE"><em>Calubaquib</em></span><em> vs. Sandiganbayan</em>, Nos. <span class="GramE">L-54272-73, </span><st1:date month="9" day="30" year="1982"><span class="GramE">September 30, 1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 117 SCRA

<p class="BODY">The question of fact refers to the sufficiency of evidence upon 
which petitioner was convicted.</p>
<p class="BODY">For a better understanding of the cases in question, it is 
necessary to have a background of the procedure for the funding of the different 
regions of the Ministry of Public Highways.</p>
<p class="BODY">At the beginning of each quarter, the Ministry of the Budget 
issues to various national government offices — the Ministry of Public Highways 
being one of them — their respective advice of allotment (AA), which is the 
authority to obligate, and the Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC) which is the 
authority to disburse.<span>&nbsp; </span>In turn, the national offices concerned, in 
this particular case, the Ministry of Public Highways, issues sub-advices of 
allotments (SAA) to the various regional offices, and the corresponding advices 
of cash disbursements ceilings (ACD).<span>&nbsp; </span>The regional offices then 
issue letters of advice of allotment (LAA) to the various districts to enable 
the district offices to incur obligations, and the corresponding sub-advises of 
Cash Disbursement Ceilings (ACD).<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> are prepared in the Budget <span>Section of the 
Accounting and Finance Division of the Regional Office, </span>forwarded to the 
Finance Officer for signature and the Regional Director or his duly authorized 
representative for counter-signature.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they are brought 
back to the Budget Section for proper release.</p>
<p class="BODY">With the receipt of the <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and the 
<span class="SpellE">CDCs</span>, the district is now equipped with authority to 
incur obligations and authority to disburse.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, as a matter 
of procedure, a Requisition for Supplies or Equipment (RSE) is prepared by the 
property custodian where the district accountant certifies as to the 
availability of funds.<span>&nbsp; </span>The project engineer also prepares a 
"Request for Obligation of Allotment" (ROA) which is likewise certified by the 
district accountant as to the availability of funds.<span>&nbsp; </span>The RSE, 
together with the program of work, is transmitted to the Regional Director for 
approval, after which it is returned to the district.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, 
canvass bid forms are sent to the different contractors or suppliers for 
quotation of prices for the materials or supplies called for in the approved 
RSE.<span>&nbsp; </span>After all bid forms are submitted, they ore opened on 
specified dates and the determination of the lowest bidder is made.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This is indicated in the Abstract of Sealed Quotations.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
purchase order is then made in favor of the winning bidder or contractor.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Deliveries are made by the contractor and, thereafter, a General Voucher, 
supported by delivery receipts and inspection reports and other supporting 
documents, is processed for the payment of the delivered materials or 
supplies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally, the corresponding check is prepared and 
released to the contractor.</p>
<p class="BODY">At the end of each month, the District Accountants of the various 
districts prepare several reports including the Report of Obligations Incurred 
(ROI) and the Report of Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officers (RCIDDO) 
which are submitted to the region.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>These reports form the 
basis for the preparation of the monthly trial balance.<span>&nbsp; </span>This trial 
balance is prepared in the Regional Office and submitted to the Central Office 
on or before the 5<sup>th</sup> of every month for final consolidation by the 
Central Office in a single trial balance for the entire Ministry of Public 
Highways which balance is then submitted to the Commission on Audit.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The <span class="SpellE">ROIs</span> submitted by the various districts to 
the regional office at the end of each month are summarized and consolidated by 
the Chief Accountant of the Region in a Journal Voucher, which is then approved 
by the Finance Officer of the region.<span>&nbsp; </span>The monthly trial balance is 
likewise prepared and signed by the Chief Accountant of the region, recommended 
for approval by the Finance Officer thereof, and finally approved by the 
Regional Director before it is submitted to the Central 
Office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">During the period from January to June 1978, the Regional Office 
of Region VII issued to <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> HED eleven (11) <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>, amounting to P292<span class="GramE">,432.46</span>, as 
recorded in the logbook of the Accounting and Finance Division.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, in addition, one hundred nineteen (119) <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> were released to <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> HED 
<span>with a </span>total amount of more than P6 million.<span>&nbsp; </span>(These 
are the <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> which are the subject of the 126 cases 
filed with respondent court).<span>&nbsp; </span>All of these 119 <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> were signed by petitioner Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> as Chief Accountant.<span>&nbsp; </span>The accompanying 
<span class="SpellE">CDCs</span> were likewise signed by him.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner's conviction was based on the following findings of the 
respondent court —</p>
<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> started the whole scheme by 
causing the issuance of the Letters of Advice of Allotment in question which 
were pointed out before as fake for there was no Sub-Advice of Allotment from 
which they were taken.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is shown in the rubber stamp mark on 
the face, left side, middle portion of the Letters of Advice of Allotment in 
question wherein he filled up all the spaces in said rubber stamp mark like the 
space for Allotment Available and signed below thereof as Chief Accountant 
I.<span>&nbsp; </span>He certified to the correctness of the Journal Vouchers 
(Exhibits "N-1" to "N-7") which negated certain transactions covered by the 
Letters of Advice of Allotment in order to conceal and at the same time approved 
them for and in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> who was not shown to 
be absent on the day said vouchers were prepared.<span>&nbsp; </span>He again 
certified to the correctness of the Journal Vouchers (Exhibits "T-5" to "T-8") 
which as stated before were all wrong because the total amount of obligations 
was very much higher than the total of the breakdown per district.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He also signed the fake Sub-Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceilings 
(Exhibits "RR", "RR-1" to "RR-16") to enable payment of fake obligations 
addressed to the City Engineer of the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City 
HED.</blockquote>
<blockquote>His persistence to execute his part of the conspiracy becomes more 
eloquent when on <st1:date month="4" day="14" year="1978">April 14, <span class="GramE">1978</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> he was detailed by 
Minister <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> of 
the Ministry of Public Highways to the Financial and Management Services of said 
Ministry, effective <st1:date month="5" day="1" year="1978">May 1, 
1978</st1:date> (Exhibit "U").<span>&nbsp; </span>In brazen disregard of said 
letter-order, he still signed Letters of Advice of Allotment from <st1:date month="5" day="2" year="1978">May 2, 1978</st1:date> (Exhibits "R-62" to 
"R-118"), the Sub-Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceiling from <st1:date month="5" day="16" year="1978">May 16, 1978</st1:date> (Exhibits "RR-11" to "RR-16") and 
the Journal Vouchers from <st1:date month="5" day="25" year="1978">May 25, 
1978</st1:date> (Exhibits "N-4" to "N-7").<span>&nbsp; </span>These actuations of 
his, prompted Region VII Director Manuel de <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> to 
send a wire to the Highway District Engineer of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> First, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City <span class="SpellE">HEDs</span> telling them that 
"Effective immediately all the allotments and cash disbursement ceilings to 
district and cities to be signed only by Finance Officer Angelina <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> and countersigned only by Regional Director Manuel de 
<span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Exhibit "DDD").</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> also certified on his official 
oath that the trial balances for January 25, 1978 to May 25, 1978 (Exhibits 
"H-1" to "H-5") "are true and complete statement of all totals and balances of 
all accounts" for the period stated in each trial balance when such was not the 
fact, for the manipulations in the Journal Vouchers (Exhibits "N-1" to "N-7"; 
Exhibits "T", "T-1" to "T-8") were carried in said trial balances.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> was not able to give any 
satisfactory explanation especially in the matter of the correctness of the 
Journal Vouchers (Exhibits "T-5" to "T-8") which on their face appear to be 
utterly wrong, it being a matter of addition.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> is liable for all of the one 
hundred twenty-six cases because all the documents he signed were the bases 
thereof."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Thus, petitioner's indispensable role in the irregularities 
in question is clear.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was the chief accountant of the Ministry 
of Public Highways, Region VII.<span>&nbsp; </span>He signed all the fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and also the fake <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The issuance of these fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> initiated the commission of the 
crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Of course, petitioner's allegation that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> erred in finding the existence of conspiracy 
must fail.<span>&nbsp; </span>No doubt the <span class="SpellE">defraudation</span> 
<span>of </span>the government would not have been possible were <span>it 
</span>not for the cooperation respectively extended by all the accused, 
including herein petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>The scheme involved both officials 
and employees from the Regional Office.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some made the 
falsifications, others worked to cover-up the same to consummate the crime 
herein charged.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's role was indubitably an essential 
ingredient especially <span>so because it was he who issued the false <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>, which as previously mentioned initiated the commission 
of the crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the defendants by their acts aimed </span>of 
<span>the same object, one performing one part and the other performing another 
part so as to complete it, with a view to the attainment of the same object, and 
their acts </span>though apparently independent, were <span>in fact concerted 
and cooperative, indicating closeness of personal association, concerted action 
and concurrence of sentiments, the court will be justified in concluding that 
said defendants were engaged in a conspiracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of 
merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> with respect to petitioner Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
