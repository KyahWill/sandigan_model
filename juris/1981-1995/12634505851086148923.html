				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Administrative charges of
(1) knowingly rendering manifestly unjust orders; (2) partiality; (3)
pretending to possess influence on one who pretends to be "<span class="SpellE">malakas</span>" with the higher authorities; (4) drunkenness,
ineffi­ciency and laxity in supervision of court personnel; and (5) oppression
against respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>,
Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Binalbagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After respondent had
filed his comment on said charges and the complainant, Atty. Romeo S. <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>, his reply thereto, <span class="GramE">We</span>
referred the case for investigation, report and recommendation to the Executive
Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Ostervaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="2"><span style="">February
 2, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, Judge <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> filed his report, which, however, is based
exclusively on the evidence of the complainant which was closed on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="1"><span style="">January
 19, <span class="GramE">1979</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">,</span></span><span style=""> because by the time respondent was to present his evidence serious
illness overcame him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As certified to by
Dr. Antonio L. Corral, he suffered from "massive cerebral </span>infarction
with paralysis of the left <span class="GramE">half</span> of the body due to
accelerated hypertension; lobar pneumonia, bilate­ral, and diabetes mellitus
and emergency <span class="SpellE">tracheactomy</span> was performed to save his
life from cardio-respiratory arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prognosis is serious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Patient confined at the Our Lady of Mercy Hospital" where he
is up to the present.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The recommendation of the Investigator reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Carefully appreciating the evidence on record presented by
complainant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>, and in the absence of
proof to the contrary, there is indubitable proof to support a find­ing of
guilty under the first listed charge - that of knowingly rendering manifestly
unjust orders and partiality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The first of such orders <span style="">is </span>that one issued on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1975</st1:date> (Exhibit "A-1"), reconsidering, lifting and
setting aside the decision rendered on <st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="7">July
 26, 1974</st1:date> (Exhibit "A-2").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is <span style="">a </span>mani­festly
unjust order because it was issued long after the decision had become
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so is this conclusion
bolstered by the fact that a series of acts implementing the decision had
already been <span class="GramE">accomplished.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, a writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1974</st1:date> (Exhibit
"A-3"), was issued to enforce the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, a notice of auction sale dated
January 24, 1975 (Exhibit "A-4"), was also issued by the Provin­cial
Sheriff, followed by the issuance of a certificate of sale dated April 14, 1975
(Exhibit "A-5").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And third,
the lifting and setting aside of the decision by virtue of a motion for recon­sideration
dated May 30, 1975 (Exhibit "A-6"), filed by Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>, respondent's close friend and counsel, should
not have been enter­tained as it was not under oath, and not accom­panied by an
affidavit of merit, as so provided by the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two other orders, one denying the motion for
reconsideration dated September 6, 1975 (Exhibit "A-7"), filed by com­plainant
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span> in an Order of September 10, 1975
(Exhibit "A-8"), and the other, an order issued on same date
directing the arrest of complainant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>
(Exhibit "A-12").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These orders
are manifestly unjust and knowingly issued for the following reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, from the <span class="SpellE">unimpeached</span>
testimony of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>, the evidence is
undisputed that the two orders in question were prepared by Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>, the very <span class="SpellE"><span style="">oppossing</span></span><span style=""> counsel of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>
in </span><span style="">Civil </span>Case No. 228
where the said orders were issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an
occasion sometimes in October-November, 1974, in the presence of Colonel <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Goyena</span>, Provincial
Commander, <span class="GramE">Judge</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
admitted having allowed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span> to make and
prepare some orders for him and which he thereafter signed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An argument between <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>
and respondent ensued but the latter stated it does not make any differ­ence if
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span> prepared the orders for <span style="">as </span>long as he signs them, they are
considered as his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This disclosure
of Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> prompted Atty. <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>
to gather pleadings belonging to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span> in
other cases of which the former was the opposing counsel, and discovered that,
indeed, the admission of Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span> prepared some of his orders is corroborated by
the appearance and style in which Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>
prepared his pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In four cases
(Exhibits "A-9", "A-10", "A-11" and
"A-13"), the uniformity in style of the way Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>
prepared his pleadings is demonstrated in the following manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) just below the heading, there appears a
continuous dash (Exhibits "A-9-B", "A-10-B",
"A-11-B" and "A-13-A"), (<span style="">2) </span>in the title for either complainants, claimants, plaintiffs
or defendants, the phrase "ET. <span class="SpellE">ALS</span>."
appears (emphasis on the letter "S") (Exhibits "A-9-C",
"A-10-C", "A-11-C" and "A-13-B", (3) the title is
underlined conti­nuously and all written in capital letters (Exhi­bits
"A-9-F", "A-10-D", "A-11-D" and
"A-13-C"), and (4) in the prayer the phrase "IN VIEW OF ALL THE
FOREGOING" are all written in capital letters (Exhibits "A-9-D",
"A-10-E" and "A-11-E").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The above-enumerated examples of the style of Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span> follow the same pattern as contained in the two
disputed orders both dated September 10, 1975, and marked as Exhibits "A-8",
and "A-12" (Exhibits "A-8-A", "A-8-B",
"A-8-C", "A-8-D", "A-8-E", "A-12-A",
"A-12-B", "A-12-C", "A-12-D", and
"A-12-E"), indicative of the inescapable con­clusion that Exhibits
"A-8" and "A-12" were both prepared by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Additionally, the fact that when the orders of August 11, 1975, and
September 10, 1975 (Exhibits "A-1", "A-8" and
"A-12") issued by Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in Civil Case
228 in favor of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span> became the subject <span style="">of review on <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
before the Court of First Instance (Exhibit "A") the same were
annulled and set aside, and more importantly, sustained and affirmed by the
highest tribunal of the land (Exhibit "D"), clinches the view that
the aforesaid orders were manifestly unjust and knowingly issued.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On partiality, the evidence of complainant is likewise clear
on the culpability of respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As testified to by complainant, he met respondent judge in <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> in the house of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that meeting, Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
informed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span> that his case of contempt and
motion for reconsideration in Civil Case No. 228 have been referred to his
lawyer, Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span> was
further told to leave <span style="">a copy as same
will be sent to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span> for the latter to
study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This disclosure irked Atty. <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span> who said, 'You mean to tell me </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">your orders are prepared by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>',
to which Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> replied, 'It does not make any
difference who prepared the order, as long as I sign it, that is my order.' In
another occasion, in the presence of Colonel <span class="SpellE">Goyena</span>,
Provincial Commander, where Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> was present,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Geocadin</span>, complained of the actuation of Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in allowing Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>
to prepare his orders and further said what chance has he to win when his
opposing counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Presquito</span>, is the one who
prepared the orders of contempt and arrest against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above facts are admitted by Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in his very own comment and/or answer to the charges
filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit
"G-1", </span><span style="">page 10 of </span><span style="">Exhibit "G").<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the charge of pretending to possess influence or one
who pretends to be '<span class="SpellE">malakas</span>' with the higher
authorities, this investigator believes that the language used by respondent
judge is highly offensive, and thus deserving of severe reprimand and
condemnation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the charge of
drunkenness, the evidence of complainant is likewise amply sufficient to induce
a finding of guilty against the respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Being heavily drunk while
in the process of holding court sessions cannot be anything less than a very
unbecoming and reprehensible act of a judge, placing the honor and integrity of
the bench in disrepute and shame.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Regarding the remaining charges of in­efficiency and laxity
in the supervision of court employees as well as oppression, this investigator
is of the considered view that respondent deserves only to be censured and
admonished.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In summation, taking into account the nature and gravity of
the charges as well as the long years of service rendered by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in the judiciary, it
is respectfully recommended that justice be tempered with mercy and that a
penalty of forfei­ture of salary for a period of THREE months be imposed upon
said respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While on its face, the report presents a picture not only of
grave misconduct but of acts unbefitting an occupant of a judicial office, the
Court cannot overlook the fact that due to no fault of his own, but because of
the serious illnesses that have overcome him, respondent was not able to
present his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that some
of the facts found by Judge <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> seem to be borne
by admissions in the comment/answer of respondent to the charges against him,
but conventional wisdom tells <span class="GramE">Us</span> that even those
admissions could have been probably explained by respondent so as to at least
mitigate his liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
there being a presumption of innocence in his favor, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are not inclined to give <span style="">full </span>weight
to the report under consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, as may be noted, Judge <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> himself
recommends benignity, considering the unfortunate condition of respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree that respondent is deserving of
compassion and<span style=""> </span>humanitarian
consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,</b> the Court hereby approves the
recommendation of the Investigator that on the <span style="">basis </span>of a <u><span style="">prima
facie</span></u><span style=""> </span>finding of acts
unbecoming of a <span style="">judicial </span>officer,
without any opportunity on his part to present evidence, the respondent be, as
he is hereby reprimanded and made to suffer the forfeiture of three (3) months <span style="">of </span>his salary, to be deducted from
whatever retirement bene<span style="">fits </span>he
may be <span style="">entitled </span><span style="">to </span>under existing laws.</p>
