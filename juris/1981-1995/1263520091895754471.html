Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> convicting Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>, Jr., and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> of the crime of murder and sentencing each of
them to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>,

the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, to pay P10,000.00 as moral
damages and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants are brothers. They were charged with committing
the crime of murder as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about December 30, 1980, in the evening, in the
munici­pality of <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, together with one John Doe whose
identity has so far not been ascertained, conspiring and mutually helping one
another, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did,
then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously
shoot one Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>, inflicting upon him gun shot
wounds, which caused his death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts established by the prosecution and found by the lower
court to have established the guilt of the two accused beyond reasonable doubt
are summarized in its decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> On December 30, 1980, in the evening, Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> Fernandez
attended the vigil of the deceased Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span>, at
her house at <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>. At about <st1:time hour="20" minute="30">8:30
 P.M.</st1:time>, they left for home, riding on a motorcycle. Mario was driving
it, and <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> was riding at the back seat thereof.
While <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, on the way
home, both accused Pat. Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> (a
policeman of <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>) and his brother, accused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>, who were each
armed with short gun (revolver), <u>fired</u> at them (Mario and <span class="SpellE">Earol</span>) when they were just 3 meters away from accused, on
the right side of the street, <u>hitting</u> Mario on the abdomen and causing
him to slump on the motorcycle dying and causing said motorcycle to travel in a
zigzag manner. Upon seeing Mario hit by the gunfire and blood was oozing from
his body, <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> held his waist with his left hand, at
the same time holding the handle bar of the motorcycle with his right hand, to
guide it in the direction of the municipal hall. After firing the first time,
both accused chased Mario and <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> and again <u>fired</u>
at them several shots. Upon turning to the left towards the municipal hall of <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, another person, fired at them again at the right side
of the road (see <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">A and E).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon reaching the house of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Cembrano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> stopped the
motorcycle and brought down the wounded and dying Mario, and went to the house
of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Galora</span> to ask his help in bringing Mario
to a hospital. <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> and Ernesto then loaded Mario on
Ernesto's car and together with companions (Eduardo Rosas and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>) and they rushed Mario to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Nazareth
  General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
arriving there at about <st1:time hour="21" minute="5">9:05 P.M.</st1:time>,
but he (Mario) expired even before arrival at said hospital.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE"><u>Earol</u></span><u> Fernandez</u>
actually <u>recognized</u> both accused as the very persons who fired the shots
at them (he and Mario), as their faces were illuminated by the headlight of the
motorcycle just before they fired their guns about 3 meters away, on the right
side of the road. He had known both accused for about 4 years prior to the
incident, and they likewise know him well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Prior to the incident, or on <st1:date month="12" day="11" year="1980">December 11, 1980</st1:date>, to be precise, while <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> was watching a dance at the public <st1:place><st1:placetype>plaza</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sual</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
accused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>
boxed him when he (<span class="SpellE">Earol</span>) went out of the dance hall,
as one <span class="SpellE">Celino</span> Padilla boxed <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span>
companion (<span class="SpellE">Quinio</span>). When <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span>
companions arrived, together with his brother, accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>, they boxed him (<span class="SpellE">Earol</span>).
Pat. Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> then held his left arm and
pulled out his service pistol and hit him with its butt on the left eyebrow,
whereupon <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>
<u>stabbed</u> him with a knife, hitting him on the left arm and on the left
thigh. He (<span class="SpellE">Earol</span>) then went to the house of Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> (his cousin) and asked him to bring him to a
hospital for treatment of his wounds. Mario loaded him on a jeep, but first
stopped at a gasoline station at <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, to load gasoline. At the gas station, when Mario's <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>, they mauled him. Mario alighted from the jeep to
<u>pacify</u> the prota­gonists, but accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>
was not agreeable, and told Mario that 'even we will be all fi­nished.' <span class="GramE">(41 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 7, 1981</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span> He (<span class="SpellE">Earol</span>) stayed inside the
jeep and urged Mario to bring him to the hospital as he was writhing in pain at
the time (42 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>). Mario brought him to

Station Commander (<span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rapelo</span>).
He called for <span class="SpellE">Rapelo</span>, who was lying inside the room. <span class="SpellE">Rapelo</span> came out and he talked to <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>.
He (Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>) asked <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>
who shot Mario and <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span> told him that Marcelo
Valdez told him (<span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>) that he was <u>unable to
identify</u> Mario's assailant. Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Rapelo</span>

<span class="SpellE">Caburao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span> went to the municipal hall of <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Rapelo</span> told him (Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>)
not to leave the checkpoint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is not true that he (Lorenzo) shot Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>. <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> Fernandez must have
filed this complaint (for murder) against him and his brother, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>, as he has a <u>grudge</u>
against him, as he (Lorenzo) had filed a criminal complaint for <u>assault upon
an agent of a person in authority</u> before this Court (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. <span class="GramE">L-2488, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Earol</span>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="1" day="4" year="1981">January 4, 1981</st1:date>,
he and Pat <span class="SpellE">Caburao</span> were placed under technical arrest
(custody) by PC Lt. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Quevido</span>, as <u>suspects</u>
in connection with the death of Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5) <span class="GramE">and</span> they were brought to
the PC headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>. Lt. <span class="SpellE">Quevido</span> interrogated him, but he told him, that he
(Lorenzo) was <u>on duty</u> at the time of the alleged incident. He (Lorenzo)
has nothing to do with the killing of Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>.
The crime scene is more than <u>1 kilometer to the checkpoint</u>. The distance
can be negotiated on foot in only <u>25 minutes</u>, more or less. They have no
jeep or vehicle in the checkpoint. On the night of the incident, he had a
service revolver, caliber .38 with 5 rounds ammunitions. He does not know where
his brother <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>
was that night, as he lives in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Baquioen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, about 5 kilometers away from the crime scene, which
is negotiable in 45 minutes on foot, or 15 minutes by jeep (28 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, January 25, 1982). His brother, Rudy <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>, has a jeep, but he (Lorenzo) does not know how
to drive. He has known Marcelo Valdez for about 10 years prior to the incident
and he is familiar to him (31 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>).
Marcelo's house is about 100 meters away from his house, and he knows his (Marcelo's)
parents, Fred and <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> Valdez (32 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>). There is no misunderstanding between
them (33 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>). There was a time (on
August 30, 1981) when Marcelo's mother (<span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>) came
to him with Councilor <span class="SpellE">Ragodos</span>, and told him that said
Marcelo Valdez was utilized as a witness in this case because he was paid (36 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>). She told him that at the sari-sari store
of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Doquinia</span>. On <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1981</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
Valdez again told him at the public <st1:place><st1:placetype>plaza</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sual</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
that 'she is going to talk to her son (Marcelo) to advise him not to testify in
this case.' <span class="GramE">(40 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>).</span>
He (Lorenzo) told her 'that's good if that is what your son will think of.' <span class="GramE">(40 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>).</span> He also
told her that 'even though this Marcelo Valdez will testify against me, because
I have not committed any crime.' <span class="GramE">(42 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

 1980</st1:date> (19 days before the shooting incident), Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <u>hit</u> him at the public <st1:place><st1:placetype>plaza</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sual</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
with an iron pipe, causing him to lose consciousness. When he regained
consciousness, he found himself at the clinic of Dr. Benjamin Castillo, at <span class="SpellE">Bugallon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>. After
discharge from said clinic, he reported the incident to the PC and gave a
statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 12) to M/Sgt. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Rillera</span>, on <st1:date month="12" day="18" year="1980">December
 18, 1980</st1:date>, supported by the statement of witnesses Jose <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 13) and Juanita <span class="SpellE">Gacuray</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 14). He had been
residing in the Bo. <span class="SpellE">Bacquioen</span> since birth and he had
known Loreto <span class="SpellE">Caburao</span>, et al. for about 4 years.
Loreto invited him to join him fishing in his '<span class="SpellE">salambao</span>'
starting the first week of December, 1980 only. He learned that Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> was shot only on <st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1980">January 1, 1980</st1:date>. He had known Mario for a long time, as
they were studying in the same school. He had known Marcelo Valdez for about 10
years, prior to the incident. On <st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1980">December
 30, 1980</st1:date>, he had no misunderstanding with Marcelo Valdez or his
parents. He also knows his parents, Fred and <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
Valdez. Marcelo Valdez testi­fied against him and implicated him in this case,
as he was hired to testify (37 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1982">Feb. 17, 1982</st1:date>). <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
visited him in the provincial jail and told him that Marcelo testified against
me, as he was hired (37 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>). He then
told <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> 'why did Marcelo Valdez do that, since I
know for a fact that I have not committed any crime?' <span class="GramE">(38 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>).</span> <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
also told him that she was looking for Marcelo, but 'she could not locate him,
because they were <u>hiding</u> him'. <span class="GramE">(40 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<u>ibid</u>).</span> Due to his mauling by Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
on <st1:date month="12" day="11" year="1980">December 11, 1980</st1:date>, he
was hospitalized for 6 days (42 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>ibid</u>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main issue presented by the assignments of errors is whether
or not the eyewitnesses to the shooting positively identified the appellants as
the perpetrators of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show positive identification. Marcelo Valdez was
seated on a concrete bench at the junction of the national highway at <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Segundera</span> Streets
when he witnessed Patrolman Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> fire their
short firearms at Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> Fernandez who were riding on a motorcycle. After the
first shot, the motorcycle zigzagged towards the bench where he was seated. The
first shot was followed by several more shots at the victims. The motorcycle
passed a bare to meters in front of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>.
The witness was certain about the identities of the <span class="SpellE">Untalascos</span>
because the two were illuminated by the headlights of a car coming from <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>. <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
had known the accused for ten years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants ask why <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
decided to hide behind the concrete bench instead of jumping into a nearby
canal where he would have been safer. They also contend that if it is true that
they were the assailants, they would have taken precautions to conceal their
identity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
to duck behind the concrete bench was instinctive. Upon witnessing a shooting
going on, he automatically hid behind the concrete bench upon which he had been
seated. It did not occur to him to look for a safer place to hide. There is
nothing unnatural or improbable about the action taken by the eyewitness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants misrepresent the facts when they state that
according to the prosecution they did not take precautions to conceal their
identity while committing such a serious crime. They committed the crime at
night in a fairly dark place which they thought was deserted. Unfortunately for
them, a passing car hit them squarely with its headlights thus enabling their
clear and positive identification by an eyewitness seated on a concrete bench.
There was similar identification by one of the intended victims whose
motorcycle headlamps also illuminated them when they started shooting at the
two riders. Furthermore, the policeman and his brother did not seem to pay much
attention to people witnessing their violent acts. Earlier, during a dance at
the public plaza, <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> Fernandez had been hit by
Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> with the butt of his service pistol
while <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>
knifed him on the left arm and the left thigh.</p>

<p class="BODY">The initial reluctance of Marcelo Valdez to be involved and the
supposed discrepancies in his statements do not affect the probative value of
his testimony. The decisive factor is that Marcelo Valdez positively identified
both assail­ants. It is admitted that both assailants were known to <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
for already ten years. <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city> could
not have made a mistake in identifying the two appellants. Besides, the defense
was not successful in establishing any motive of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
in testi­fying against them. As regards the supposed candid remark of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>'
mother to the appellant that <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
was hired to testify against both appellants, we concur with the lower court's
observation that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">This</span> is hardly believable and <u>inherently
improbable</u>. No mother will ever do such a thing to her own son, unless she
is out of her mind, knowing that if her son perjures or gives false testimony,
he will be held criminally answerable for it. No mother in this world, though
how depraved or morally bankrupt, she maybe would do anything to send her own
beloved son to jail."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The unwillingness of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
to identify the two appellants when first questioned and even when the NBI
agents interviewed the frightened people in the vicinity is not a sign that his
later statements are false or concocted. As stated in <u>People v. Munoz</u>
(107 SCRA 313) and <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span></u> (2 SCRA
911) the initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer information about a
criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved in criminal investigations
is common and has been declared as not affecting credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the assailants was a police officer of the town where the
crime was committed. It is understandable why a witness would not initially
divulge the assailants' identities to the police authorities. The brutal
slaying which <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city> witnessed plus
the fact that the perpetrators were a police officer and his brother could have
created a fear that he might be the next victim. As a matter of fact, the two
appellants chased <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city> when they
saw him running to the nearby house of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>.
He looked back at the two and again clearly identified them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> Fernandez is
similarly positive and convincing. He was riding on the motorcycle with Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>. He saw the appellants fire their guns while their
faces were illuminated by the headlight of the motorcycle. The guns were also
pointed at him because he was riding tandem with <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
on the motorcycle. Fernandez and the two appellants knew one another quite well
for about four years. Fernandez had a violent encounter with the two not long
before the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants ask why Celia <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>,
widow of the victim, did not state the names of the appellants but merely
mentioned that the suspects were policemen of <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>
and relatives of the town mayor when she wired the Minister of National Defense
and Major General Fidel V. Ramos, for an investigation into her husband's
killing. There is no connection between Fernandez knowledge of the identity of
the killers and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Lazaro's</span> failure to name the
suspects in her telegram. The victim's widow was asking for an investigation of
a crime. It would have been rather imprudent for her to name the killers in a
telegram and, thereby, anti­cipate the results of the requested investigation.
It was enough to describe them and await the arrival of investigators to whom
further details could be given.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another factor raised by the appellants is the fact that the
shells and slug recovered were of .45 <span class="GramE">caliber</span> while
the service firearm taken from appellant Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span>
was a .38 caliber revolver. The caliber of the gun is not conclusive proof that
Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> could not have participated in the
killing of Mario <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>. The appellants were both
armed and they could have used firearms different from the revolver turned over
by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Untalasco</span> very much later. Considering
that eyewitnesses <span class="SpellE">Earol</span> Fernandez and Marcelo Valdez
positively identified both appellants as the perpetrators of the crime, the
defense of alibi presented by the appellants is unavailing. (People v. Lucero,
96 SCRA 694). It is not phy­sically impossible for the appellants to have been
seen in the places where the alibi located them and still commit the crime.</p>
