Valenzuela, Metro Manila, Branch 172, with a violation of Section 4, Article II
of Republic Act No. 6425, otherwise known as “The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972,”

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment on <st1:date year="1990" day="24" month="1">January
 24, 1990</st1:date>, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and continuous trial was conducted on January 29, February 7, 14 and 26, and
March 2, 5, 7, 9 and 16, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's documented presentation of this case, which is
closely in accord with the findings of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="5">May 9,1990</st1:date>, the Anti-Narcotics Unit of
the Valenzuela Police Station received a tip from an informer that a pusher was
selling marijuana at <st1:street><st1:address>Liwayway St.</st1:address></st1:street>,
Marulas, Valenzuela.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. Wilfredo
Quillan who received the information immediately relayed the same to his
superior, P/Sgt. Loreto Rodriguez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rodriquez formed a 'buy-bust' team composed of Pat. Quillan, P/Sgt.
Loreto Rodriguez, P/Cpl. Victoriano Mercado, Pfc. Dante Dogoldogol, and Pat.
Tamayo and Patag, to apprehend the pusher.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Quillan was designated as the 'poseur-buyer' (pp. 1-2, tsn, <st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="1">Jan. 29, 1990</st1:date>, Quillan).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The ‘buy-bust’ team prepared P30.00 as marked money, then
proceeded to the place mentioned by the informer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, after appellant was pointed out to
them by the informer as the notorious pusher, Pat. Quillan approached appellant
and bought P30.00 worth of marijuana from him (pp. 2-3, <u>ibid</u>.).<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“After giving appellant the marked money and receiving three tea
bags of marijuana, Pat. Quillan announced that he was a policeman and arrested
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He retrieved from appellant
the marked money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. Quillan then
asked if appellant still had any marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant said he had two tea bags left and voluntarily surrendered the
same to Pat. Quillan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was then
taken to the Valenzuela police station for booking and investigation (p. 3,
id.).”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense, on the other hand, presents this version of the
antecedent facts:</p>

<blockquote>“The accused is 23 years old, married, and a tinsmith by occupation
earning P90.00 a day as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is also
a member of Kabataang Barangay (TSN, March 2, 1990, p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1990</st1:date>, between <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, he was in Quiapo as he is a devotee of
the Black Nazarene of Quiapo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
been such since 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in the previous
years, he was one of the devotees who carried the shrine during the procession.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time>
that afternoon, after carrying the Black Nazarene barefoot for 4 hours (Ibid,
p. 5), he took a ride home, arriving at BBB, Marulas, Valenzuela, his place of
residence, about forty-five minutes later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because his feet were aching, he stopped for some refreshments and a
little rest at a store three Meralco posts away from his house at <st1:street><st1:address>Liwayway
  St</st1:address></st1:street>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While he was seated facing the store, a jeep stopped behind him
and Pat. Wilfredo R. Quillan alighted therefrom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Pat. Quillan arrested him,
allegedly for drug pushing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At the time of the arrest when the accused was asking what he was
being arrested for, he saw somebody inside Pat. Quillan's jeep who was pointing
at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he found out that the
man's name is Elmer Mapa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elmer Mapa was
in the company of Pat. Dogoldogol and many others inside the jeep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Pat. Quillan forced the accused to admit possession of the
marijuana the former was holding but which the latter claims to have come from
Elmer Mapa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The accused vehemently denies that Pat. Quillan bought 3 teabags
of marijuana from him, nor that he ever surrendered to Pat. Quillan two more
bags of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid, p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has no I.D. because when he was
apprehended, it got lost along with his P1,000.00 which was taken by Pat.
Quillan (p. 8, Ibid, p. 4, TSN, March 5, 1990).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The accused is very familiar with Pat. Quillan as the latter, as
well as Pat. Dogoldogol, frequently patrol their (accused's) place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused also used to see these policemen at
the Municipal Hall in connection with the errands he used to run for the
President of Kabataang Barangay (pp. 6-7, TSN, <st1:date year="1990" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1990</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The accused, together with Elmer Mapa, who was apprehended
allegedly for possession of cough syrup was brought to the police
precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elmer Mapa was released after
paying P500.00, while the accused was detained for failure to cough up
P20,000.00 grease money demanded by Pat. Quillan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused did not file any charges against
Pat. Quillan because he was afraid as he had already been hit and hurt with a
piece of yantok (p. 8, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“An eyewitness, Rolando Obugan, a barangay tanod in the same
community, testifying for the accused testified that he saw the entire arrest
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He corroborated the story of
the accused on all material points.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He met the accused at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time>
<st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1990</st1:date> who told him that he (accused) would be
going to Quiapo by reason of the latter's devotion to the Black Nazarene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was wearing white T-Shirt with
the picture of the Black Nazarene printed on it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The accused was drinking soft drinks at the time he was arrested
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was only 8 feet away from
the scene of the arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No buy-bust
operation took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was
simply taken by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (witness)
had not heard that the accused was selling marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not see any marijuana at the time of
the arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 3, TSN, March 7, 1990).”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Forensic chemist Raquel P. Angeles of the National Bureau of
Investigation testified that the five teabags reportedly seized from appellant
and presented as evidence by the prosecution, after being subjected to
microscopic, chemical and chromatographic examinations, gave positive results
for marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is attested to by
the certification she issued and Dangerous Drugs Report No. DDM-­90-48 of their
office, both dated <st1:date year="1990" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1990</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court below promulgated its decision, dated
March 19, 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
finding the accused guilty of the crime charged, sentencing him to suffer the
penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P20,000.00 and the costs,
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and crediting him with
the entire period of his preventive imprisonment.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant now comes to us for the reversal of the aforequoted
judgment, faulting the trial court (1) for allegedly giving undue weight to the
improbable, inconsistent and contradictory testimonies of prosecution witnesses
Wilfredo Quillan and Dante Dogoldogol; (2) in not giving due consideration to
appellant's defense of denial; and (3) in finding appellant guilty beyond
reasonable doubt despite the insufficiency of evidence against him. <a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Once again, as in most criminal cases, the controversy here is
reduced to one essentially of credibility, a weighing of the evidence of the
prosecution against that of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this regard, the consistent teaching of our jurisprudence is that the
findings of the trial court are given weight and the highest degree of respect
by the appellate court.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is an entrenched rule founded on the fact that the matter of
assigning value to declarations at the witness stand is best and most
competently performed by the trial judge, who, unlike appellate magistrates,
can weigh such testimony in the light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct and
attitude at the trial and is thereby placed in a more competent position to
discriminate between the true and the false.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Deviation from the rule is allowed only when the circumstances of the case show
that the trial court has overlooked facts which will substantially alter the
results of its adjudication.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We perceive nothing in this case which would warrant such diversion.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pat. Quillan's testimony, on direct and cross-examination,
categorically established the material points of the People's case against
appellant, thus:</p>

did he surrender?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Because I introduced myself as a policeman."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. Dante Dogoldogol amply corroborated<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the foregoing narration of Pat. Quillan which likewise tallied with the
“Sinumpaang Salaysay”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
executed by the latter on January 9, 1990.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The testimonies of said apprehending officers were straightforward and
consistent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As expressly observed by the
trial court, Quillan's demeanor was unchanged by anger or spite even in the
face of the accusation of the defense that he demanded grease money from
appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have ruled that credence shall be given to the narration of
the incident by the prosecution witnesses especially when they are police
officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner,
there being no evidence to the contrary.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
More so is this true in the present case where the buy-bust operation was
methodically done, with surveillance operations transpiring for more or less
one hour before the apprehension of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The procedure adopted by the police officers
in this case therefore jibes with the application of the presumption of
regularity in the performance of official duties.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is appellant's submission that he would not have sold
marijuana to Pat. Quillan whom he knew to be a law enforcer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further alleges that it is hardly
believable for him to sell marijuana cigarettes to a buyer he does not know.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In light of our judicial experience and pronouncements, these contentions
cannot but be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time and again, we have ruled that the liability of appellant
lies not on the existing familiarity between the buyer and the seller, but on
their agreement and the acts constituting the sale and delivery of the
marijuana leaves.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In real life, pushers, especially small-quantity or retail pushers, sell their
prohibited wares to customers, be they strangers or not, who have the price of
the drug.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Drug pushers have become increasingly casual about their activities and less
cautious about isolated transactions like the one at bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not, therefore, unusual or improbable for a drug pusher to sell to a
total stranger.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Of late, we have likewise observed the practice of appellants
raising the defense that, since they know that the prosecution witnesses are
police officers, it is improbable that they would sell marijuana to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have heretofore pointed out, aside from
lack of corroboration, such a pretense is a matter that can be so easily
contrived, since all that the malefactor has to do is to affect supposed
knowledge of the identity of the peace officer and then seek refuge in that
self-serving contention.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
This is a stratagem that does not impress us.</p>

<p class="BODY">In response to appellant's query as to why Pat. Quillan was so
sure that he was selling marijuana by the teabags,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
suffice it to say that Quillan is an experienced operative having been assigned
to the Anti-Narcotics Unit of the Valenzuela Police Station since 1985.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously availing of his experience, he won the confidence of appellant by
addressing him with a show of familiarity in this manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“Boy Piso, pagbilhan nga ng 3 teabags ng
marijuana sa halagang P30.00.”<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Since appellant was addressed by name and Quillan did not look like a
policeman, this further explains why he unhesitatingly sold marijuana to
Quillan.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also not incredible that appellant readily yielded two more
teabags of marijuana upon having been asked by Pat. Quillan whether he still
has marijuana in his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be
noted that appellant surrendered the remaining teabags while being frisked by
the law enforcers.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
As appositely noted by the Solicitor General, after failing in his initial
attempt to escape and knowing that he would be subjected to a body search,
appellant must have thought it best to surrender what was left of his marijuana
supply,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
evidently because further resistance or manipulations would be unavailing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense of denial was completely refuted by the
officers and their uncontradicted testimony of his participation in the
unlawful transaction.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Since he could not point to any ill motive of his arrestors in apprehending
him, nor any grudge that would impel them to implicate him in the charge, such
identification should be given weight since witnesses would not falsely impute
to the accused a serious criminal offense if it is not the untarnished truth.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's testimony is also flawed by its apparent
inconsistency with common human experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He claims that because his feet were aching, he stopped for some
refreshment and a little rest at a store which was three electric posts away
from his house at Liwayway Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
he was seated facing the store, a jeep stopped behind him and Pat. Wilfredo R.
Quillan alighted therefrom:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
Pat. Quillan arrested him, allegedly for drug pushing.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
We quote with approval the observation of the trial court on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x Likewise, with the unrebutted
evidence of the prosecution that the accused is a ‘talamak na pusher’, x x x
the Court believes that there is here a case of entrapment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what was the accused doing in that store,
seated alone, instead of going directly to his house after the (4) hour
procession at Quiapo where he allegedly carried the Black Nazarene?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few more meters walk to his house would not
be that too tiring (sic) and an extreme sacrifice for his alleged tired feet, especially
when it would be more in the exercise of common sense that he would rather go
direct home and lie down to give himself the much needed rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x.”<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, appellant admitted having been seated in the jeep on
his way home.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
The journey from Quiapo to Valenzuela of almost an hour was long enough to give
him a breather from the long and tiring Black Nazarene procession, enough to
dispense with the necessity of his still stopping to rest at the store on
Liwayway Street before, and instead of, proceeding to his house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also claims having in his pocket P1,000.00 when he went
to and as he mingled with the crowd in Quiapo.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, this is improbable, if not incredible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No reasonably sensible man would bring with him such an amount, for no purpose
at all, during a Black Nazarene procession where thousands of devotees brave
the heat and the multitude just to join the Catholic faithful in paying homage
on that occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of general
knowledge that in that religious celebration, one has to contend with a large,
closely–packed and moving horde, where pickpockets and opportunists abound and
take advantage of the melee, as perceptively explained by the lower court in
disbelieving appellant's claim that he had the alleged amount.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's allegations that he was tortured and divested of his
money by the apprehending officers<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
does not deserve any consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
utterly failed to substantiate the same and, if it were true, there could be no
reason why he, either by himself or through his relatives, did not file any
criminal or administrative charges against the erring police officers.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The attempted corroboration through the testimony of defense
witness Rolando Obugan falls far short of its intended purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obugan claimed that he saw appellant at about
12:00 noon of January 9, 1990 and he learned that the latter was joining the
procession for the Black Nazarene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next time he saw appellant was at 7:00 P.M. of the same day when the latter was
in a store around eight meters away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When asked what appellant was doing there, Obugan could only answer with
uncertainty:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“I think he was drinking
soft drinks in the store at that time, sir.”<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering the darkness of the night and the distance involved, even assuming
the truth of his presence at the scene, he could not have definitely or known
what precisely transpired between appellant and Pat. Quillan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concluding, we digress to express our approval of the comparative
dispatch with which this case has been handled, from the investigative through
the prosecutorial and judicial stages, until the same was ready for our
adjudication, all with provident care and concern for the procedural and
evidentiary safeguards of our criminal justice system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional rights of appellant to
speedy and impartial trial have been scrupulously observed and, at the same
time, the authorities have acted in line with the penological theory that fair
and expeditious dispensation of justice is a major deterrent against crime.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the foregoing disquisition and considerations, we are
thoroughly convinced that the guilt of accused-appellant Rolando Castillo y
Martinez for the offense charged has been duly proven beyond reasonable doubt
and that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not err in its verdict and
pronouncements.</p>
