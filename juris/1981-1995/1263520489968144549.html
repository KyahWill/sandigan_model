Court of Appeals which declared the disputed property as forest land, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">These two petitions have
their genesis in an application for confirmation of imperfect title and its
registration filed with the Court of First Instance of Capiz.  The parcel of land sought </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">be registered is known as Lot No. 885 of the Cadastral Survey of Pilar,
Capiz, and has an area of 645,703 square meters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Roque Borre, petitioner
in G.R. No. L-30035, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Melquiades Borre, filed the application for
registration.  In due time, the heirs of
Jose Amunategui, petitioners </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
G.R. No. L-27873 filed an opposition to the application of Roque and Melquiades
Borre.  At the same time, they prayed
that the title to a portion of Lot No. 885 of Pilar Cadastre containing 527,747
square meters be confirmed and registered in the names of said Heirs of Jose
Amunategui.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The Director of Forestry,
through the Provincial Fiscal of Capiz, also filed an opposition to the
application for registration of title claiming that the land was mangrove swamp
which was still classified as forest land and part of the public domain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Another oppositor,
Emeterio Bereber filed his opposition insofar as a portion of Lot No. 885
containing 117,956 square meters was concerned and prayed that title to said
portion be confirmed and registered in his name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">During the progress of
the trial, applicant-petitioner Roque Borre sold whatever rights and interests
he may have on Lot No. 885 to Angel Alpasan.  The latter also filed an opposition, claiming that he is entitled to
have said lot registered in his name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">After trial, the Court of
First Instance of Capiz adjudicated 117,956 square meters to Emeterio Bereber
and the rest of the land containing 527,747 square meters was adjudicated in
the proportion of 5/6 share to Angel Alpasan and 1/6 share to Melquiades Borre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Only the Heirs of Jose
Amunategui and the Director of Forestry filed their respective appeals with the
Court of Appeals.  The case was docketed
as CA-G.R. No. 34190-R.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In its decision, the
Court of Appeals held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x the conclusion so far must have
to be that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>to the private
litigants that have been shown to have a better right over Lot 885 are, as to
the northeastern portion of a little less than 117,956 square meters, it was
Emeterio Bereber and as to the rest of 527,747 square meters, it was the heirs
of Jose Amunategui; but the last question that must have to be considered is
whether after all, the title that these two (2) private litigants have shown
did not amount to a registerable one in view of the opposition and evidence of
the Director of Forestry; x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x turning back the clock thirty
(30) years from 1955 when the application was filed which would place it at
1925, the fact must have to be accepted that during that period, the land was a
classified forest land so much so that timber licenses had to be issued to
certain licensee before 1926 and after that; that even Jose Amunategui himself
took the trouble to ask for a license to cut timber within the area; and this
can only mean that the Bureau of Forestry had stood and maintained its ground
that it was a forest land as indeed the testimonial evidence referred to above
persuasively indicates, and the only time when the property <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>converted into a fishpond was
sometime after 1950; or a bare five (5) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">y</span>ears
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">before the filing of the application;
but only after there had been a previous warning by the District Forester that
that could not be done because it was classified as a public forest; so that
having these in mind and remembering that even under Republic Act 1942 which c</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ame </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

applica­tion;'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">conclusion that not one of the
applicants </span>or oppositors had shown that during the required period of
thirty (30) years prescribed by Republic Act 1942 in order for him to have

<blockquote>it is evident that the Bureau of Forestry
had insisted on its claim all throughout that period of thirty (30) years and
even before and applicants and their predecessors had made implicit recognition
of that; the result must be to deny all these applica­tions; this Court stating
that it had felt impelled notwithstanding, just the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to resolve the conflicting positions of the
private litigants among </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">themselves
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">as to who of them had
demonstrated a better right to possess because this Court foresees that this

pass final judgment;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

which is hereby sustained are dismissed; no more pronouncement as to
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> was filed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the Heirs of Jose Amunategui contending that
the disputed lot had been in the possession of private persons for over thirty
years and therefore in accordance with Republic Act No. 1942, said lot could
still be the subject of registration and confirmation of title in the name of a
private person in accord­ance with Act No. 496 known as the Land Registration
Act.  On the other hand, another
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> was filed by Roque Borre and
Encarnacion Delfin, contending that the trial court committed grave abuse of
discretion in dismissing their complaint against the Heirs of Jose
Amunategui.  The Borre complaint was for
the annulment of the deed of absolute sale of Lot No. 885 executed by them in
favor of the Heirs of Amunategui.  The
complaint was dismissed on the basis of the Court of Appeals' decision that the
disputed lot is part of the public domain.  The petitioners also question the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals
in passing upon the relative rights of the parties over the disputed lot when
its final decision after all is to declare said lot a part of the public domain
classified as forest land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The need for resolving
the questions raised by Roque Borre and Encarnacion Delfin in their petition
depends on the issue raised by the Heirs of Jose Amunategui, that is, whether
or not Lot No. 885 is public forest land, not capable of registration in the
names of the private applicants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The Heirs of Jose
Amunategui maintain that Lot No. 885 cannot be classified as forest land
because it is not thickly forested but is a "mangrove swamp".  Although conceding that a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"mangrove swamp" is included in the
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">classification of forest land in
accordance with Section 1820 of the Revised Administrative </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Code, the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">petitioners argue that no big trees classified in Section 1821 of said
Code as first, second and third groups are found on the land in question.  Furthermore, they contend that Lot 885, even
if it is a mangrove swamp, is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">still
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">subject to land registration
proceedings because the property had been in actual possession of private
persons for many years, and therefore, said land was already "private
land" better adapted and more valuable for agricultural than for forest
purposes and not required </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

kept under forest classi­fication.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petition is without
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">A forested area
classified as forest land of the public domain does not lose such
classification simply because loggers or settlers may have stripped it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">its forest cover.  Parcels of land
classified as forest land may actually be covered with grass or planted to
crops by kaingin cultivators or other farmers.  "Forest lands" do not have to be on mountains or in out of the
way places.  Swampy areas covered by
mangrove trees, nipa palms, and other trees growing in brackish or sea water
may also be classified as forest land.  The classification is descriptive of its legal nature or status and does
not have to be descriptive of what the land actually looks like.  Unless and until the land classified as
"forest" </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">released in an official proclamation to that
effect so that it may form part of the disposable agricultural lands of the
public domain, the rules on confirmation of imperfect title do not apply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">This Court ruled in the
leading case of </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Director of
Forestry v. Muñoz</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(23 SCRA 1184) that possession of forest
lands, no matter how long, cannot ripen into private ownership.  And in </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Republic v. Animas</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(56 SCRA 499), we granted the petition on the
ground that the area covered by the patent and title was not disposable public
land, it being a part of the forest zone and any patent and title to said area
is void ab initio.  It bears emphasizing
that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">positive act of Government is needed to
declassify land which is classified as forest and to convert it into alienable
or disposable land for agricultural or other purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The findings of the Court
of Appeals are particularly well-grounded in the instant petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The fact that no trees
enumerated in Section 1821 of the Revised Administrative Code are found in Lot
No. 885 does not divest such land of its being classified as forest land, much
less as land of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">domain.  The appellate court found that in 1912, the land must </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">have </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">been a virgin forest as stated by Emeterio Bereber's witness Deogracias
Gavacao, and that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">late as 1926, it must have been a thickly
forested area as testified by Jaime Bertolde.  The opposition of the Director of Forestry was strengthened by the
appellate court's finding that timber licenses had to be issued </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">certain licensees and even Jose Amunategui himself took the trouble to
ask for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a license </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to cut timber within the area.  It was only sometime in 1950 that the
property was converted into fishpond but </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">only </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">after a previous
warning from the District Forester that the same could not be done because it
was clas­sified as "public forest."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In confirmation of
imperfect title cases, the applicant shoulders the burden of proving that he
meets the requirements of Section 48, Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended by
Republic Act No. 1942.  He must overcome
the presumption that the land he is applying for is part of the public domain
but that he has an interest therein sufficient to warrant registra­tion in his
name because of an imperfect title such as those derived from old Spanish
grants or that he has had continuous, open, and notorious possession and
occupation of <u>agricultural lands of the public domain</u> under a bona fide
claim of acquisition of ownership for at least thirty (30) years preceding the
filing of his application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The decision of the
appellate court is not based merely on the presumptions implicit </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Commonwealth Act No. 141 as amended.  The records show that Lot No. 885 never
ceased to be classified as forest land of the public domain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In <u>Republic v. Gonong</u>
(118 SCRA 729) we ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">"As </span>held in Oh
Cho v. Director of Lands, 75 Phil. 890, all lands that were not acquired from
the Government, either by purchase or by grant, belong to the public
domain.  An exception to the rule <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">would </span>be any land that should have
been in the possession of an occupant and of his predecessors-in-interests
since time immemorial, for such possession would justify the presumption that
the land had never been part of the public domain or that it had been a private
property even before the Spanish conquest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petitions, the exception in the Oh Cho case does
not apply.  The evidence is clear that
Lot No. 885 had always been public land classified as forest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Similarly, in <u>Republic
v. Vera</u> (120 SCRA 210), we ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"x </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">x x </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The possession of
public land however long the period thereof may have extended, never confers
title thereto upon the possessor because the statute of limitations with regard
to public land does not operate against the State, unless the occupant can
prove possession and occupa­tion of the same under claim of ownership </span>for
the required number of years to constitute a grant from the State.  (Director of Lands v. Reyes, 68 SCRA 177,
195)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, affirm the finding that the disputed <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">property Lot No. </span>885 is part of the
public domain, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">classified as </span>public
forest land.  There is no need for <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">us to </span>pass upon the other issues
raised by petitioners Roque Borre and Encarnacion Delfin, as such issues are <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">rendered moot by </span>this finding.</p>
