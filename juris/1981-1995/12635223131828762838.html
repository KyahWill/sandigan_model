Accused-appellant, Rogelio Ervas, was charged with Rape in three 
separate Informations before the then Court of First Instance of 
Sorsogon, docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 702, 729 and 730, upon 
criminal complaint filed by DOLORES del Monte, the offended party, a 
girl, eleven years of age.
<p>
Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty, and after a 
consolidated trial, he was acquitted in Criminal Cases Nos. 702 and 729.
 In Criminal Case No. 730, he was found guilty, as charged, and 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>; to pay DOLORES the sum of P5,000.00 as moral damages, P3,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs.
</p><p>
Hence, this appeal.
</p><p>
The prosecution version, insofar as the last two incidents complained of
 are concerned, has been summarized in the People's Brief thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On or about November 20, 1977, while complainant was in her 
residence in barangay Carriedo, Gubat, Sorsogon, appellant dropped by. 
As complainant's parents were out that time selling hogs in town (p. 19,
 t.s.n., October 18, 1978) appellant dragged the complainant to a nearby
 santol tree. At said place, appellant undressed himself and afterwards 
undressed likewise the complainant. Thereafter, appellant placed himself
 on top of complainant, inserted his sex organ into the latter's sex 
organ and made an 'up and down' movement. Complainant felt pain in her 
vagina (pp. 27-29, t.s.n., October 17, 1978) although the former's sex 
organ only partially penetrated hers (p. 13, t.s.n., October 18, 1978). 
Complainant could not shout as her mouth was covered by appellant's 
right hand, (pp. 13-14, <em>Supra</em>). After the sexual act, appellant
 put on his clothes, similarly, complainant put on her clothes. 
Appellant gave complainant twenty-five centavos and warned her not to 
reveal the incident to anybody, otherwise he would kill complainant's 
family (pp. 29­30, <em>Supra</em>). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At about three o'clock in the afternoon of November 26, 1977, appellant 
was in the complainant's house. He requested complainant's younger 
brother, Junior, to buy some cigarrettes and thereafter asked 
complainant where he could get some guavas. Complainant answered that 
there are no more guavas as she had already gathered them. Nevertheless,
 appellant went to the place where complainant gathered said fruits and 
was followed by complainant and her sister Nida (pp. 5-6, t.s.n., 
October 3, 1978).
</p><p>
Upon complainant's return to the house, her mother was surprised why 
complainant's blouse was already tucked in. Inspecting complainant's 
blouse, her mother found a one-peso coin. Complainant was asked where 
she got the money and she answered that it was given by appellant. Not 
satisfied with the answer, her mother demanded for an explanation and 
threatened to whip complainant if the latter will not tell the truth. At
 this juncture, Erlinda Diesta, aunt of complainant arrived and joined 
in questioning the latter why appellant gave her money. (pp. 7-10, 
t.s.n., October 3, 1978).
</p><p>
As complainant refused to answer the questions asked of her by her 
mother and aunt, Erlinda Diesta, the latter, decided to bring 
complainant to her grandmother's house to extract the real truth from 
complainant.
</p><p>
On their way, however, complainant informed Erlinda Diesta that the former had a sexual intercourse with ap­pellant (pp. 17-18, <em>Supra</em>).
</p><p>
Returning to the complainant's house, Erlinda Diesta informed 
complainant's mother that her daughter was raped by appellant. 
Complainant then admitted to her mother that she was raped by appellant 
on three occasions, the first being on November 18, 1977, which incident
 was the subject matter of Criminal Case No. 729 wherein appellant was 
acquitted, the second time being on November 20, 1977 subject matter of 
the instant appeal, and third time, on November 26, 1977, which incident
 was the subject matter of Criminal Case No. 702, wherein appellant was 
likewise acquitted by the trial court (pp. 4-5, t.s.n., <em>Supra</em>).
</p><p>
On November 28, 1977, complainant was medically examined (p. 11, <em>Supra</em>) by Dr. Antonio Falcotelo who subsequently issued a medical certificate (Exh. 'B') which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    'Findings:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        -   Vulva Slightly gaped
    </p>
    <p>
        -   Vagina admits 1 finger easily
    </p>
    <p>
        -   Hymen lacerated with healed (sic) scar at 9:00 o'clock
    </p>
    <p> -   No apparent signs of external Physical injuries."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defense is one of total and general denial, appel­lant alleging that
 the charges were pure fabrication, moti­vated by a strong desire for 
retaliation against the Ervases for having put the del Monte family to 
shame.
</p><p>
Thus, appellant testified that Antonio del Monte (DOLORES' paternal 
uncle) was caught in the act of stealing coconuts in the plantation of 
one Alfredo Hababag, by appellant's brother, Salvador Ervas, the tenant 
and overseer of said property who lost no time in reporting the incident
 to Hababag, thus paving the way for the filing by Hababag of a criminal
 complaint against Antonio, and that upon release of Antonio from jail 
through the posting of bail, he had sworn to take vengeance on the 
Ervases.
</p><p>
Appellant and his brother, Salvador, further testified that on various 
other occasions, the latter had also caught Dolores herself, her father,
 Alfonso del Monte, her brothers and sisters, and her cousin Armando 
Diesta (son of prosecu­tion witness Dominga del Monte) stealing coconuts
 in the land of Hababag. But on advice of the owner, no complaints were 
filed.
</p><p>
Appellant claims that the Court <em>a quo</em> gravely erred in 
convicting him (1) despite facts and circumstances which cast grave 
doubts on the credibility of prosecution evidence, and (2) despite 
absence of evidence beyond reasonable doubt to sustain the same.
</p><p>
Appellant faults the Trial Court for relying heavily on the medical 
findings of "laceration of DOLORES' hymen with healed scar at nine 
o'clock and that her vagina admits one finger easily." He takes issue 
with that Court's conclusion that the lacerated hymen was caused by the 
entry of his sex organ into complainant's vaginal canal arguing that it 
was more through "manipulation" in his having "fingered" her sex organ, 
an act conveniently referred to as a necessary act preliminary to actual
 coitus. Thus, appellant claims, considering DOLORES' admission of only 
partial penetration during the incident of November 20, 1977, he should 
be convicted only for the lesser offense of acts of lasciviousness.
</p><p>
The contention is utterly baseless. As the Solicitor General has aptly pointed out:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Undoubtedly, complainant's lacerated hymen at 9:00 o'clock and 
the finding that her vagina easily admits one finger are evidence of the
 highest order that an intercourse was in fact committed upon 
complainant. Said physical fact speaks mote eloquently than a hundred 
witnesses (People vs. Sacabin, L-36638, June 28, 1974). Moreover, to 
constitute the crime of rape mere entry of the male organ into the labia
 of the woman, without reaching the hymen is sufficient (People vs. 
Hernandez, 49 Phil. 980, 982)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of significance is it to note that when a woman testifies that she has 
been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape 
was committed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  provided her testimony is clear and free from serious contradictions, and her sincerity and candor, free from suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  The defense has not satisfactorily proven that DOLORES, a young girl 
barely eleven years of age, had any ulterior motive to accuse appellant 
of so serious an offense and had indulged in mere "fabrications". The 
Trial Court had found "her degree of understanding is not just too 
comprehensive to entrust her with a confabulation too complicated and 
too evil for her to grasp". As she had testified clearly and 
unmistakably in respect of the three incidents:

</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing testimony is so candid and straightforward as to leave no 
room for doubt that appellant had carnal knowledge with a woman under 
twelve years and is thus guilty of rape even assuming that force or 
intimidation were not used or even if the woman had not been deprived of
 reason or otherwise unconscious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  It eloquently disproves appellant's contention that it was merely 
"manipulation" that had caused the laceration of complain­ant's hymen 
and that he should only be found guilty of acts of lasciviousness.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby af­firmed except as to 
the damages awarded, which is hereby increased to a lump sum amount of 
P15,000.00. Costs against accused-appellant, Rogelio Ervas.
