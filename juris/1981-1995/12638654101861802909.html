of a 20-year old mental retardate is the subject of this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case as found by the trial court are as follows
-</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1987</st1:date>
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon,
the victim Jessie Sajol, a 20-year old mental retardate, while on her way to
the house of Ernesto Paragsa, met the appellant along the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant took hold of the victim,
dragged her away from the road brought her to a nearby grassy area and forced
her to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant managed
to pull down the victim's kneepants and underpants afterwhich he took off his
pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim tried to run away
while the appellant was removing his pants but he pulled her closer to him and
threatened her with a bolo and said that he would kill her if she would resist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the victim was lying on the ground, the
appellant opened her legs, boxed her thigh and succeeded in having sexual
intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Maria
Sajol, the mother of the victim, saw her daughter crying, along the road, near
the scene of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When queried
by her mother, the victim declared she was raped by Geronimo Goles, the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She immediately brought her
daughter to the house of Goles, who, when confronted, denied having raped
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, mother and daughter reported
the matter to the police before whom they executed their respective affidavits.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 19, 1987, a criminal complaint signed by Maria N.
Sajol and Jessie Sajol with the conformity of the Station Commander, Conrado A.
Oraiz, was filed in the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Surigao del Sur.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>On October 20, 1987, an
information was filed in the Regional Trial Court of Bislig, Surigao del Sur,
Br. 29 accusing Geronimo Goles of the crime of rape committed against Jessie
Sajol.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 31, 1987, the appellant was arrested and detained at
the provincial jail of Bislig.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At his arraignment
on January 22, 1988, he entered a plea of not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered judgment on November 3,
1988 finding the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape,
sentencing him to a penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> and ordering
him to pay the aggrieved party Jessie Sajol the amount of P30,000.00 as moral
damages and P5,000.00 as exemplary damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the appeal before Us, the appellant assigns the following
errors:</p>

<p class="NUM">1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the trial court had
no jurisdiction to hear the case because the information was not signed by the
complainant, and</p>

<p class="NUM">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the guilt of the
appellant was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first assignment of error, the appellant avers that the
information accusing him of the crime of rape was not signed by the complainant
or by her parents; hence, the lower court did not acquire jurisdiction to try
and decide the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this
theory, appellant cites Section 5, Rule 110, 1985 of the Rules on Criminal
Procedure, as amended, which provides that "the offenses of seduction,
abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness shall not be prosecuted except upon a
complaint filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or
guardian, x x x."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court had occasion to reject this argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement that the offense of rape must
be prosecuted upon complaint filed by the offended party is found in Article
344 of the Revised Penal Code<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and the aforestated Section 5 of Rule 110.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Expounding on the meaning and significance of this requirement, this
Court held in <u>People vs. Hon. Santiago Ta√±ada</u><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x In the 1966 case of Valdepenas v. People this Court
through then Associate, later Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion clarified:</blockquote>

<blockquote>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is true that pursuant to the third paragraph of Art. 344 of the Revised Penal
Code,</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the offenses of
seduction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted
except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her parents. . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>The provision does not determine, however, the jurisdiction of our
courts over the offenses therein enumerated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It could not affect said jurisdiction, because the same is governed by
the Judiciary Act of 1948, not by the Revised Penal Code, which deals primarily
with the definition of crimes and the factors pertinent to the punishment of
the culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint required in
said Article is merely a condition precedent to the exercise by the proper
authorities of the power to prosecute the guilty parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And such condition has been imposed out of
consideration for the offended woman and her family who might prefer to suffer
the outrage in silence rather than go through with the scandal of a public
trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>This ruling was followed in the subsequent case of People v. Babasa
where the Court, citing the Valdepenas case, ruled that Article 344 was not
enacted for the specific purpose of benefiting the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it is said that the requirement in
Article 344 that there should be a complaint of the offended party or her
relatives is jurisdictional, what is meant is that it is the complaint that
starts the prosecutory proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not the complaint which confers jurisdiction on the Court to try the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court's jurisdiction is vested in it by
the Judiciary Law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the prosecution for the crime of rape was
commenced by the filing of the criminal complaint which was signed not only by
the complainant but also by her mother in accordance with Rule 115, Section 5
considering that the complainant is mentally incompetent.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This criminal complaint was the basis for the preliminary investigation
conducted by the fiscal and the subsequent filing of the information in
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the law is it required
that the complainant likewise sign and verify the information for rape filed by
the fiscal.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the very information filed by the fiscal reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned, <u>on complaint under oath</u>, hereby
accuses GERONIMO GOLES of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That on or about the 11th day of October, 1987, at about 3:00
o'clock in the afternoon, more or less, at Sitio Nazareth, barangay Sta. Juana,
municipality of Tagbina, province of Surigao del Sur, Philippines, and within
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a
bolo, with the use, intimidation and violence, did, then and there, willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the complainant Jessie
Sajol against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice in the
following amounts, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>P30,000.00 - as moral damages; and,</blockquote>

<blockquote>P<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>5,000.00 - as exemplary damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article
335 of the Revised Penal Code)."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court takes note of the reference in the first paragraph to
the sworn complaint of the offended party filed with the fiscal by the phrase
"on complaint under oath." This goes to show that said criminal
complaint was in effect reproduced as part of the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial said complaint of the offended party was
presented in evidence marked as Exhibits B-B-1.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
There was thus sufficient compliance with the requirement of the law and the
trial court correctly assumed jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, in the case of People vs. Sunpongco,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
where the criminal complaint filed by the offended party for the purpose of
preliminary investigation was not presented in evidence during the trial and
where the information was filed by the fiscal, this Court ruled that the trial
court can take judicial notice of the complaint that was forwarded with the
records of the preliminary investigation to the court, without necessity of its
formal introduction in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant, in his second assignment of error, points out that
the trial court failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For his defense, he claims that he and the
supposed aggrieved party are sweethearts and at the time of the alleged
commission of the crime, they purposely met pursuant to an agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further alleged that there was consent to
have sexual intercourse but the act was not consummated because of the arrival
of the mother of complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
in fact confirmed by the mother of complainant who testified that he merely
used his finger and by the medical certificate which indicated that no sperm
was found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also no sign of
injury on the victim negating the theory that there was a struggle by the
victim or that force was employed on her person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was not even a torn dress presented as
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the complainant's alleged
mental retardedness is contradicted by her membership in different social and
religious organizations in the community.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arguments raised by appellant are devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant would have the Court believe that he and the victim
are sweethearts who mutually consented to have sexual intercourse, but like in
many other rape cases<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
where this same defense had been raised, the Court is not persuaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not present any proof like a letter or
a ring perhaps, to support his allegation that he and the victim are
sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite his claim that they
met for the first two times at the house of his uncle, he did not present said
uncle or any other member of the household to prove his theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The further fact that the victim is a mental
retardate makes his story incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
her defective state of mind, complainant could not have induced appellant to
nurture a desire to have her for a sweetheart.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, she could not have possessed the capacity to understand the
meaning having such a relationship with him.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It does not appear that the complainant or her mother has any
ill-motive to falsely testify against the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, if the charge was not true, the victim's mother would not have rushed
to appellant's house to confront him and, immediately thereafter, reported the
matter to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in
one case where the victim was also a mental retardate, it would be preposterous
to assume that the victim, whose intelligence quotient is admittedly low, could
have concocted the grave charge of rape, or that she and her mother would go
into the trouble of having her medically examined, going to court and
advertising to the whole world she had been raped if the charge was merely
invented.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the testimony of the mother corroborates the story of
the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw her daughter crying
along the road who immediately told her what transpired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was no truth to the charge, the
victim would not have been in such a state and she would not have told her
mother that she was raped ("gilogos" in the Visayan dialect) by the
appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Mrs. Sajol even saw for herself the exact spot where the crime happened with
the cogon grass still pressed down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court correctly considered the statements made by the victim to her
mother immediately after the incident as part of the <u>res</u> <u>gestae</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the appellant's argument that the victim's mother confirmed
his claim that he did not rape her, the records show that the victim's mother
testified that "Geronimo Goles told us that, I did not rape her but I just
used my fingers."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
This is mere hearsay since she only repeated what the appellant told her when
he was confronted and this in no way confirms his allegation that he merely
used his fingers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, this is a
self-serving statement which cannot prevail over the categorical statement of
the victim that the accused inserted his penis inside her vagina.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Relative to the finding that no sperm was found, it has been
repeatedly held that the presence of sperm cells is not indispensable to prove
the offense of rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> The
examination disclosed that there was bleeding dominant on the porterior vaginal
wall as well as discharges, mucoid in nature, coming from the vaginal canal
mixed with blood and discharges on the cervical mucosa which would indicate
that there was penetration of the victim's vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the attending physician concluded
that the condition of the victim is compatible with rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim likewise testified that she felt pain
in her vagina during coitus and that she was bleeding after the incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, by the time the examination was conducted, the victim had already
washed her private parts and had urinated several times thus washing away the
sperms which may have been present in her vaginal canal.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of injury on the person of the victim does not
negative rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a doctrine well-settled that in order to consider the existence of the
crime of rape, it is not necessary that the force and/or intimidation employed
in accomplishing it be so great or of such character as could not be resisted,
it is only necessary that the force and intimidation used by the culprit be
sufficient to consummate the purpose which he had in mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
The victim had initially resisted the advances of the appellant and she even
shouted twice for help; however, the appellant threatened to kill her if she
did not consent and at the time he had in his possession a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The threat to her life was sufficient to
instill in the childlike mind of the victim a fear so great that she had no
choice but to give in to the lustful desires of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The positive declaration of complainant that
the appellant threatened to kill her should be given more weight than the
simple denial of the accused<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The further fact that no torn dress was presented by the
prosecution does not negate rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
The absence of a torn dress or panty is explained by the fact that the victim
no longer offered any resistance by reason of the intimidation employed upon
her by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, physical intimidation prior to sexual intercourse is
not necessary for rape to be committed considering the mental deficiency of the
victim such that she is incapable of giving consent to the sexual act.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
It is for this reason that the appellant makes much of the alleged membership
of the victim in different social and religious organizations to counter her
supposed deficient mental state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the testimony of the victim's mother, it can be seen that she is a member of a
church organization and as such member she helps in cleaning and weeding the church
premises,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
activities which a mental retardate is not incapable of doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the victim is a mental
retardate should not stop her or her parents from making her useful to the
community.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the trial court found the version of the prosecution to
be more credible, which finding is amply supported by the evidence on record,
for which reason the Court upholds the judgment of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
finding the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of rape as
charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The indemnity awarded should be increased to P40,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the above modification as to the
indemnity, the judgment of conviction is hereby AFFIRMED in all other respect,
with costs against the appellant.</p>
