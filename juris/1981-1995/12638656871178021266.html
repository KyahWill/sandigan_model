				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition </span>for
review of the decision of respondent <span style="">Court </span><span style="">of
</span>Appeals dated <st1:date month="2" day="27" year="1987">February 27, 1987</st1:date>,
which dismissed the <span style="">appeal </span><span style="">by petitioner </span><span style="">therein </span>on the ground of tardy filing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Originally, the </span>case
arose from an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suit <span style="">twice filed by petitioner </span>German
Management and Services, Inc. (GERMAN, for short) against private respondent
Lessee <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Eltanal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first one was filed before the then City
Court of <span style="">Manila on February </span>21,
1972 docketed <span style="">as
</span>Civil Case No. 209946 <span style="">which was
eventually </span>dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal
to the then Court of <span style="">First Instance of
Manila, </span>the lower court’s decision <span style="">was </span><span style="">affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision </span>became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
on <st1:date month="2" day="9" year="1984">February 9, 1984</st1:date> or
almost nine (9) years later, petitioner filed the second unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case against private respondent invoking the very
grounds relied upon in the previous case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Metropolitan Trial Court, on January 9, 1986 dismissed the case
holding that Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
877 prohibits the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of lessee at the end of
each month; the case is barred by prior judgment; lessee did not sub-lease the
leased premises; and that the findings of the then City Court of Manila in
Civil Case No. 209946 apply to the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Regional Trial Court, it
affirmed the appealed decision <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner received copy of the aforementioned decision on <st1:date month="4" day="26" year="1986">April 26, 1986</st1:date> and filed a motion for
reconsideration thereof on <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1986">April 30,
 1986</st1:date>, theorizing that the case is not within the ambit of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 877 because <span style="">a </span>month-to-month lease is considered
to be for a definite or fixed period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, the respondent court disagreed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date month="5" day="7" year="1986">May 7, 1986</st1:date>, it
came out with its order denying subject motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Copy </span>of
the order of denial was received for petitioner on <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1986">May 19, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
what counsel for petitioner did next was to go before the then Intermediate
Appellate court on a petition for <span class="GramE">review.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Records show that the petition under
consideration was filed and docketed on <st1:date month="6" day="3" year="1986">June
 3, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that the law relied upon by respondent
lessee, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
877, is inapplicable to the leas<span style="">e </span>sued
upon which <span style="">is </span>on <span style="">a “</span>month to month basis terminable at
the end of every month”; and, therefore, it can eject under Article 1673(1),
New Civil Code on the ground of expiration of the lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submits that</p>

<blockquote>“1. <span style=""> </span>RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING
THAT THE PETITION FOR REVIEW WAS TARDILY FILED; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. RESPONDENT
COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT A LEASE CONTRACT ON A MONTH TO MONTH
BASIS IS FOR A DEFINITE PERIOD.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">As had already been held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span>
vs. <span style="">IAC, </span>143 SCRA 643:</p>

<blockquote>“The final judgment
or order of <span style="">a </span>regional trial
court in an appeal from the final judgment or order of <span style="">a </span>metropolitan trial court, municipal trial court and municipal
circuit trial court, may be appealed to the Court of Appeals through a petition
for review in accordance with Section 22 of BP No. 129 and Section 22 (b) of
the Interim Rules, or to this Court through <span style="">a </span>petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> in accordance with
Rule 45 <span style="">of </span>the Rules of Court and
Section 25 of the Interim Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason for extending the period for the filing of a record on appeal is also
applicable to the filing of <span style="">a </span>petition
for review with the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">The</span></u><span style=""> <u>period</u> <u>for</u> </span><u><span style="">filing</span></u><span style=""> <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">petition</span></u><span style=""> <u>for</u> </span><u><span style="">review</span></u><span style=""> <u>is</u> </span><u><span style="">fifteen</span></u><span style=""> <u>days</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>If <span style="">a motion </span>for reconsideration <span style="">is </span>filed with and denied by a regional trial court, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> has only remaining <span style="">period within </span>which to file a petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it <u><span style="">may</span></u><span style=""> <u>be</u></span>
<u><span style="">necessary</span></u><span style=""> </span>to file <span style="">a </span><u>motion</u> with the Court of Appeals <u><span style="">for</span></u><span style=""> <u>extension</u> </span><u>of</u> <u>time</u> <u>to</u><span style=""> </span><u>file</u> <u><span style="">such</span></u><span style=""> <u>petition</u> </span><u>for</u> <u><span style="">review</span></u><span style="">.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 5-6 Decision; pp.
22-23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court correctly ruled when it said that:</p>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">xxx</span>
the petition <span style="">was </span>tardily
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was filed beyond the
fifteen-day period to appeal, within which a petition for review is to be
brought, pursuant to CA en banc Resolution of August 12, 1971, the prevailing
rule at the time of the filing of the instant petition on June 3, 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly pointed out by respondents, from
April 26, 1986, when petitioner moved to reconsider said decision, four (4)
days had run; leaving only eleven (11) days of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period for appealing or filing a petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with Section 3, Rule 41,
Revised Rules of Court, such motion for reconsideration interrupted the running
of the period to appeal but the same resumed to run on May 19, 1986, the date
of receipt for petitioner of the Order of May 7, 1986 denying its aforesaid
motion for reconsideration, so that petitioner had only until May 30, 1986 to <span style="">bring </span>its petition for review before
the then Intermediate Appellate Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, as earlier stated, the petition under scrutiny <span style="">was </span>filed
only on <st1:date month="6" day="3" year="1986">June 3, 1986</st1:date>, at a
time when subject decision of the respondent court had already become final and
<span class="SpellE">executory</span>.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 5, Decision; p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that
petitioner never asked for an extension of time to file the petition in the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it was
no longer within the jurisdiction of the </span>respondent court to review <span style="">the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision in question and to pass upon the merits of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Garcia vs. <span class="SpellE">Echiverri</span>, G.R. No<span style="">.
