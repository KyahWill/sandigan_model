				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition is an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> from the
decision dated January 18, 1990 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 13717
entitled, "<span class="SpellE">Severino</span> Go, doing business under the
name and style '<span class="SpellE">Goning</span> Construction Supply' vs. Ayala
Integrated Steel Manufacturing Co., Inc.," which modified the decision of
the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> by
increasing the award of damages in favor of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts which may be culled from the decision of the appellate
court are:</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 8, 1979, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
Go (Go for short) made two purchases from petitioner Ayala Integrated Steel
Manufacturing Co., Inc. (Ayala for short) in the net total amount of P32,755
after price and <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> adjustments were made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1979</st1:date>, Go also made one purchase of materials from Ayala under
Invoice No. 6746 in the amount of P22<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As payment for the first two purchases, Go issued four (4)
postdated checks on <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1979</st1:date>
for the total sum of P32<span class="GramE">,755</span>, namely:<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ABC Check No. 12214, postdated <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="1">15 January 1980</st1:date>, in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,755.00</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first two checks were honored by the bank so that <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> total net obligation was reduced to P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, his <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1979</st1:date> purchase of P22<span class="GramE">,000</span> remained unpaid.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="13" year="1980">February 13, 1980</st1:date>,
a fire gutted completely <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> store resulting in the
loss of his ledgers, accounting books, and other records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the next day, he instructed the Allied
Banking Corporation to stop payment on his 3rd and 4th checks (ABC Checks Nos.
00012212 and 00012221) for he could not deposit the necessary funds to cover
them because of the losses he suffered in the fire.</p>

<p class="BODY">On account of the stop-payment order, Ayala filed against Go in
August, 1980, a criminal complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and for
violation of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
22 in the Manila City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A preliminary investigation of the complaint
was conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties entered into
negotiations for an amicable settlement until they finally agreed that Go would
pay his balance of P20,000 in installments and that after full payment, Ayala
will return to him his two ABC checks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Go also promised to pay his other account of P22<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Ayala, thru its president and
general manager, wrote the City Fiscal of Manila requesting for the provisional
dismissal of the case, with <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> conformity thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the aforesaid agreement, Go made the following
payments:</p>

<blockquote>1) <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1980</st1:date>

<p class="BODY">The first three (3) checks had the effect of liquidating in <span style="">full </span>the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
while the next succeeding three (3) checks partially liquidated the sum of
P8,000 covered by ABC Check No. 00012221, thereby leaving a balance of P2,000,
which Go retained because Ayala did not return <span style="">his </span>two (2) checks despite his repeated demands (p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">By <st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1981">December 1, 1981</st1:date>,
Go had fully settled his account.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, he was required to appear before the City Fiscal of
<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City on <st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1982">January 26, 1982</st1:date> to answer a criminal complaint for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> and Violation of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
22 filed by Ayala against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A civil
complaint was also filed by Ayala against him (Civil Case No. Q-35558) in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, seeking to
recover the principal sum of P29,640 plus 1% interest thereon from October 1979
until fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date month="1" day="28" year="1982">January
 28, 1982</st1:date>, the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City dismissed the criminal complaints on the supposed reason that an amicable
settlement had previously been concluded by the parties in I.S. 80-17840 before
the Manila City Fiscal (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about the same time, i.e., <st1:date year="1981" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1981</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">Go</span>
filed against Ayala a complaint for consignation and damages, docketed as Civil

reason of the dismissal of I.S. No.</span> KC-81-3197-98 by the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Fiscal, Ayala filed on <st1:date month="1" day="24" year="1982">January 24, 1982</st1:date> Civil Case No. Q-35558 in the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City for recovery of
the unpaid balance and other obligations of Go to Ayala (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The civil
case pending before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City was likewise dismissed on <st1:date month="4" day="16" year="1983">April
 16, 1983</st1:date> (pp. 28-30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Go subsequently filed a civil case for consignation of a sum of <span style="">money </span>with <span style="">a </span>claim for damages in the Regional Trial Court, Branch XIX, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-20796) for
the unlawful, malicious, oppressive, and abusive acts of Ayala.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, Ayala
withdrew the <span class="SpellE">consignated</span> sum of P24<span class="GramE">,000</span>
which was given due course by the trial court on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rendered a decision in Civil Case No. R-20796,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiff:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring</span>
as valid the tender of payment and consignation made by the plaintiff in the

<p class="BODY">Both Ayala and Go appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1990</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals modified the appealed judgment by increasing the award of
moral damages to P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> and the award of actual and
consequential damages to P21,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition for review, Ayala assigns only one error:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the Court of Appeals and the trial court
erred in awarding moral and actual damages for alleged malicious prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ayala argues that it should not be made liable for damages for
exercising its right to collect <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> unpaid account.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="GramE">Go</span> alleges that
because of Ayala's malicious and oppressive conduct in filing criminal charges
against him, it should indemnify him for the damages he has suffered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the appellate court and the trial court found that Ayala
acted in bad faith <span style="">in </span>filing the
baseless criminal complaints against Go for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
and for violations of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22, one in Manila and
the other in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> to harass, terrorize, and
intimidate Go to settle his unpaid obligation of P2,000 to Ayala.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court observed:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">We</span> are inclined to
agree with the findings of the lower court that the filing of the said case was
not justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be <span style="">remembered that the criminal complaint filed
before the City Fiscal of Manila was dismissed upon the agreement of the
litigants that the plaintiff-appellant will periodically satisfy his
indebtedness to the defendant-</span>appellant in the amount <span style="">of </span><span style="">P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In compliance therewith, the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>
evidence for the plaintiff-appellant clearly showed that he consistently made
payments amounting to P18,000.00, and he stopped making his last payment in the
sum of P2,000.00 only </span>when the defendant-appellant for <span style="">reasons only known to it unjustifiably
refused to return to him the two <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>With this factual <span style="">milieu, </span>the subsequent filing of the
criminal <span style="">case therefore, before the
City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City appeared to </span>be
without basis, as correctly <span style="">observed by
the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that
the said criminal complaint was for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and for
violation </span>of <span style="">B.P. 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the case of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
is concerned, We fully agree with the findings of the </span>lower court that
there was no existing element of deceit and <span style="">misrepresentation because the alleged refusal of the
plaintiff-appellant to continue paying the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
was not an act </span>of defrauding the defendant?<span style="">appellant under any of the enumerated grounds mentioned in Articles 315
and 316 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, there can be no case of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In like manner, not one of the six checks
issued by the plaintiff-appellant was dishonored which could have been the
basis for filing the criminal complaint for violation of B.P. 22." <span class="GramE">(p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While sound principles of justice and public policy dictate that
persons shall have free resort to the courts for redress of wrongs and
vindication of their rights (<st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, 103 Phil. 239), the right to
institute criminal prosecutions should not be exercised maliciously and in bad
faith (<st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, 38 SCRA 587).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, in <span class="SpellE">Yutuk</span> vs. Manila Electric Co. (2
SCRA 337), this Court held that the right to file criminal complaints should
not be used as a weapon to force an alleged debtor to pay a debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow it would be a perversion of the
function of the courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
in <span class="SpellE">Hawpia</span> vs. Court of Appeals (20 SCRA 536), this
Court affirmed the judgment for actual and moral damages and attorney's fees
against a party who harassed the other party by filing six criminal complaints
against the latter, all of which were dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moral damages include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright,
serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social
humiliation, and similar injury (Art. 2177, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though incapable of pecuniary computation,
they may be recovered if they are the proximate result of the defendant's
wrongful act or omission (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, 129 SCRA
625).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is important to note that
"damages are not intended to enrich the complainant at the expense of a
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are awarded only to
alleviate the moral suffering that the injured party had undergone by reason of
the defendants' culpable action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no hard and fast rule in the determination of what would be a fair amount of
moral damages, since each case must be governed by its own peculiar
circumstances" (<span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span> Credit Corporation vs.
IAC, 166 SCRA 155).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the Court
of Appeals increased the moral and actual damages awarded by the trial court,
the awards are not excessive but only commensurate with the mental anguish,
hardships, inconvenience, and expenses that the private respondent suffered and
incurred as a result of the malicious prosecutions initiated by the petitioners
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is denied for lack of
merit, the Court perceiving no reversible error in the decision of the Court of
Appeals which we hereby affirm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioner.</span></p>
