on the leading case of Director of Forestry v. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in this appeal by <i>certiorari</i> from a decision of the then Judge Mariano
V. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, now deceased, declaring that 417 pieces
of logs in General <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, <span style="">had
been legally cut by private respondent New Timber­land Corporation, but
ordering it to pay to the govern­ment the amount of P711.07 still due from his
forest </span>charges or fees, and to refrain from cutting any log in its
concession as its license had in the meanwhile been cancelled by the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, is more than justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow private respondent to retain
possession of the logs in question when no permission had been granted by the
then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the constitutional mandate as to the
nationalization and conservation of natural resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As so clearly set forth in the opinion of
Justice Sanchez in <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The view this Court takes of the cases
at bar is but in adherence to public policy that should be followed with
respect to forest lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many have
written much, and many more have spoken, and quite often, about the pressing
need for forest preservation, conservation, protection, development, and
reforestation."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The judiciary is thus ever called upon to <span style="">see </span>to it that no dubious claim to forest products should be
recognized.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts are undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case arose from an action for injunction
with prayer for preliminary prohibitory injunction filed by private respondent
Timberland Corporation with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, then presided by respondent Judge.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The then Director of Forestry and the then
District Forester, petitioners now but then respondents, opposed the granting
of a preliminary injunction based on lack of jurisdiction and <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another case between the same parties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> They then filed their answer, raising the
special and affirmative defenses that the respondent Court had no jurisdiction
to issue a writ of injunction, whether permanent or preliminary, enforceable
outside <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> to
control the acts of the Director of Forestry; that assuming </span><span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> <span style="">that
the court had jurisdiction, the Timberland Corporation was without a cause of
action because its proposed license over the </span><span style="">forest area pursuant to which the disputed logs were cut was
disapproved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources; and that
respondent Timberland had not exhausted all administrative remedies before
invoking judicial intervention.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> At the hearing, it was disclosed that
without the required approval of a proposed license by the then Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, respondent Timberland Corporation took the
risk of operating in the areas formerly licensed to its incorporators, thus
enabling one of them to cut and haul about 417 pieces of logs deposited in his
log pond at General <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners did stop the respondent in its
logging operations, inventoried the logs and seized the said logs in the care
of one <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Aves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="7"><span style="">July 2,
 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, disapproved
the proposed license in favor of the New Timberland Corporation, as directed by

 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, then respondent Judge rendered
the decision as above set forth, basing his decision on the proposed license of
a former Director of Forestry disregarding such lack of approval by the then
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court gave due course to the petition
and directed the stay of the execution of the judgment sought to be
reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the answer was filed by
respondents, petitioners filed their brief to be followed by respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no reply brief on the part of
petitioners, the case was deemed submitted for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Fidelity to the <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> doctrine extensively relied upon by <span class="GramE">petitioners</span> calls for a reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted likewise that in the recent

provided the main support </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the conclusion reached, reference was made to
cases decided even before the 1935 Constitution to demonstrate that this Court
had rigorously adhered to the principle of conserving forest resources, as a
corollary to which the alleged right to them of private individuals or entities
was meticulously inquired into and more often than not rejected.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We do so again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why the judgment should
be adverse to respondents is categorically asserted in the excerpt from the
brief of petitioners:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The ruling
is plainly erroneous and untenable, in law and in fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place no license <u>was ever
issued</u> and released to respondent Timberland, for such kind of license is <u>not
<span class="SpellE">issuable</span></u> upon the <u>sole authority</u> of the
Director of Forestry, but <u>is subject to the approval</u> of the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Support for such a view comes from Forestry Administrative Order No. 11,
Section 14 of which requires that for a licensee to do what was done by private
respondent, there must be an approval of the then Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources the proposed timber license involving the cutting of 1,000
cubic meters or more for a period not exceeding four years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out in the brief:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Since the license <u>proposed</u> to be
issued to respondent corporation was not approved by the Secretary of Agri­culture
and Natural Resources, the same is not a license granted in accordance with the
regulations (Forestry Administrative Order No. 11, particularly Sec. 14,
thereof).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a <u>mere proposal</u>
conferring no right upon the respondents to commence the conduct of logging
operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forestry Administrative
Order No. 11 was published in the <u>Official</u> <u>Gazette</u>; it was issued
and promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce (Natural
Resources) pursuant to Sections 79(b) and 1817 of the Revised Administrative
Code, upon the recommendation of the Director of Forestry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has the force and effect of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Section 1831 of the Revised
Administrative Code provides that forest products shall be cut, gathered and
removed from any forest only <u>upon license from the Director of Forestry</u>,
it is no less true that as a subordinate officer, the Director of Forestry is
subject to the control of the Department Head or the Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources (Sec. 79(c), Rev. Adm. Code), who, therefore, may impose
reasonable regulations in the exercise of the powers of the subor­dinate officer."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It should not be lost sight of that Forestry Administrative Order No. 11 was
recom­mended by no less than the Director of Forestry himself and thereafter
approved by the then Secretary of Agri­culture and Commerce, the department
entrusted with such matters in 1934.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
further contended by petitioners:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"What is more, in this case, the Director of Forestry himself <u>submitted
the proposed license</u> to the Secretary of Agriculture and<sup> </sup>Natural
Resources '<u>for approval</u>' thereby <u>implying</u> that he <u>was not
exercising</u> the statutory power vested in him under the Revised
Administrative Code, <u>to issue a license</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of a valid license, therefore, the cutting of logs as was done
by private respondent was clearly unauthorized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As they were illegally cut, private respondent had no right to the
possession of the disputed 417 pieces of logs.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The force of the above
contention must have been evident to counsel for private respondent for in the
eight-page brief submitted, there was hardly any attempt to dispute the
soundness of the legal proposition as above set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stress was on good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That does not suffice, as the property
involved clearly belongs to the State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the facts as duly proved, the judgment certainly was without support.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the appealed judgment is reversed and set as</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">de
and the petition for injunction filed by private respondent against the present
petitioners dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against private respondent Corporation.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
