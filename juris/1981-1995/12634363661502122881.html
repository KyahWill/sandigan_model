				<H3>ELPIDIO SY, PETITIONER, VS. JUDGE EMELITA
HABACON-­GARAYBLAS, IN HER CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF METROPOLITAN TRIAL
COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH 7, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>QUIASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a sworn complaint dated July 1, 1993, Elpidio Sy charged Judge
Emelita Habacon-Garayblas of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Metropolitan
</span>Trial Court, Branch 7, Manila with gross ignorance of the law,
partiality and knowingly rendering an unjust judgment or order, in relation to
Civil Case No. 131430-CV, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>ejectment
case entitled "Systems Realty Development Corporation vs. Maria P.
Garcia." Complainant is the duly authorized representative of Systems
Realty Development Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 16, 1992, respondent rendered a decision in favor of the
plaintiff in said case (Annex "A") and on August 20, 1992, she issued
a writ of execution (Annex "C").  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">A </span>Notice to Vacate was
served on defendant on August 21, 1992, giving her three days within which to
leave the subject premises (Annex "D").</p>

<p class="BODY">According to complainant, when Sheriff Samuel Caballes was about
to enforce the writ of execution, respondent whimsically and illegally stopped
the implementation thereof by issuing an Order dated August 24, 1992, directing
the sheriff "to hold in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">abeyance </span>the
implementation of the Writ of Execution issued by the Court dated August 20,
1992" (Annex "E").  The
basis of the order was an unverified Manifestation filed by one Dr. Peter B.
Flores, who claimed to be the occupant of the subject premises (Annex
"F").</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant alleged that respondent maliciously and unlawfully
refused to lift the questioned Order despite several motions and pleadings to
lift the same (Annexes "G", "G-1", "G-2" and
"G-3").  Complainant even
filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i> on October 13, 1992, with the Regional
Trial Court, Branch 39, Manila to compel respondent to implement the writ of
execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her comment dated August 19, 1992, respondent explained that
her actions were justifiably taken to enable her to judiciously resolve the
issues of whether Dr. Flores was claiming rights under the defendant in Civil
Case No. 131430-CV and whether the writ of execution may be enforced against
him.  Thus, respondent issued an order
dated September 12, 1992, setting the Manifestation for hearing on October 12,
1992 and directing the sheriff to hold in abeyance the implementation of the
writ of execution.  On October 13, 1992,
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">day </span>following the hearing,
complainant filed the petition for <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent averred that the Regional Trial Court, acting on the
petition for <i>mandamus</i>, issued an order directing her to elevate the
records of the case to said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court.  She also noted that the complainant filed a
motion for withdrawal of the petition for <i>mandamus</i> on July 19, 1993,
which motion had not yet been acted upon.  Neither have the records of the case been returned to respondent's sala.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We find respondent's
explanation satisfactory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As admitted by complainant, possession of the subject premises
was claimed by Dr. Peter B. Flores, a third party or stranger to the ejectment
case.  Thus, respondent's act of
suspending the implementation of the writ of execution was justified under the
doctrine laid down in <u>Sta.</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Ana</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> <u>v.</u> <u>Suñga</u>, </span>54 SCRA 36,
44 [1973]:</p>

<blockquote>"There may be cases when the actual possessor may be <i>claimed</i>
to be a <i>privy</i> to any of the parties to the action, or his bona-fide
possession may be disputed, or where it is alleged, as in the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> instant case, that such possession has been
taken in connivance with the defeated litigant with a view to frustrating the
judgment.  In any of these events, the </span><i>proper
procedure</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">would be to </span><i>order
a hearing</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">on the matter of such
possession and to deny or accede to the enforcement of </span>a writ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of possession as the finding shall
warrant.  But in the </span><i>absence</i>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of any such hearing or any proceeding
of similar character, every person in the actual possession of the land has a
right to be </span><i>respected</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">therein
(Art. 446, Civil Code) and his ejectment would constitute a </span><i>deprivation</i>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of a property right </span><i>without
due process</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of law" (citing 2
Moran Rules of Court, 1970 ed., p. 36).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the manifestation filed by Dr. Flores was
unverified does not militate against respondent taking cognizance thereof.  The requirement regarding verification of a
pleading is formal, not jurisdictional.  The court may order the correction of the pleading if the verification
is lacking or act on the pleading although it is not verified, if the attending
circumstances are such that strict compliance with the rules may be dispensed
with in order that the end of justice may thereby be served (Villarica v. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 96085, March 16, 1992, First Division, Minute Resolution).</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant also cannot fault respondent for not resolving the
several motions to lift the questioned Order dated August 24, 1992.  Respondent could not take action on the
motions because complainant filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>petition
for <i>mandamus</i> with the Regional Trial Court on October 13, 1992 to compel
respondent to lift the questioned order.  As a consequence of said filing the records of the case were taken out
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">respondent's hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Complainant failed </span>to
show that respondent acted with bad faith, illegal motive and evident
partiality in issuing the order suspending the implementation of the writ of
execution and in not acting on the motions filed by him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">,<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
complaint against respondent is </span>DISMISSED for lack of merit.  Respondent is DIRECTED to take action and
resolve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">WITH </span>DISPATCH the cases
subject of this complaint.</p>
