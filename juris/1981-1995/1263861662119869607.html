by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) of the award of financial
assistance granted by the Labor Arbiter to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as found by the respondent NLRC, are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainants Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dorotea</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamaca</span>, Asuncion Vera, <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Dacallos</span>, Yolanda Villanueva, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Dabe</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zoraida</span> <span class="SpellE">Delantar</span>, Anita
Dana and <span class="SpellE">Anacurita</span> Navarro filed this complaint for
illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice and moral damages against the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.,
the employer of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the complainants, Ramon
<span class="SpellE">Panique</span>, the president and owner of the company, and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span>, former
president of the </span>union, <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Malayang</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It appears that on February 5, 1981, the union, <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Malayang</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span>
Industries and the company entered into a compromise agreement wherein the
company agreed to give financial assistance amounting to P20,000.00 in
consideration for the union's withdrawal of Case No. NCR-FSD-J­5-662-79.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the union members became curious,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span>
was asked to explain in a general meeting held on April 4, 1982 as to what
happened to the P20,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
making an explanation, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span>
tendered her written resignation, the acceptance of which was made on April 5,
1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Nuguid's</span>
resignation, the union became dormant for more than three (3) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining officers then convened a
meeting on July 13, 1982, wherein three resolutions were passed and approved,
namely: 1) affiliating the union to a federation, the National Federation of
Labor; 2) giving the federation the authority to represent the union on all
matters concerning labor relation problems; and 3) creating a steering
committee to serve and act as union board of officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On August 5, 1982, the National Federation of
Labor informed the respondent company on the new union structure and the
affiliation of the local union with the federation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On July 29, 1982, in a general union meeting conducted by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span>, a resolution
was approved expelling the complainants from the union and asked (sic) the
company to terminate their services in accordance with the provision of the
collective bargaining agreement entered into between the union and the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On August 16, 1982, the ten (10) complainants
were dismissed from the service as per request of the union headed by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp.29-30.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 28, 1983, Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> issued a decision in this case, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, respondent <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries Philippines, Incorporated should be,
as it is hereby, directed to reinstate complainants to their former positions
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">regular workers/employees without <span class="SpellE">Backwages</span> within ten (10) days from receipt of this
Decision and under the same terms and conditions of employment and without loss
of seniority rights and privileges existing before their dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>However, since complainants are not at fault, respondent <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries, Incorporated should be as it is
hereby directed to extend financial assistance to the said complainants in an
amount equivalent to six (6) months of their respective salaries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The complaint for unfair labor practice and moral damages is both
dismissed for lack of merit. (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 27.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the NLRC, the aforesaid judgment was affirmed but
the award of financial assistance was deleted for having neither legal nor
factual basis (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 32.] Hence, the instant
petition, imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in
deleting the award of financial assistance.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it should be pointed out that the instant special
civil action limits the charge of grave abuse of discretion to the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> act of setting aside the grant of financial
assistance to petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
do not assail the order for their reinstatement without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is no need for the Court to
dwell on the order for their reinstatement without any <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
which was sustained by the respondent NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the sole issue raised in this case is whether the
respondent Commissioners of the NLRC gravely abused their discretion in
deleting the award of financial assistance to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners stance is that the company had full knowledge of the
fact of resignation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span> and
therefore, of her lack of authority to act for and in behalf of the union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when it dismissed the petitioners
pursuant to <span class="SpellE">Nuguid's</span> request, it had participated in
their illegal dismissal through its negligence (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 8.] Petitioners argue that the company is accordingly liable for financial
assistance to compensate the sufferings and damage sustained by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the public respondents justify their deletion
of the award of financial assistance on two grounds: 1) that the award has no
legal basis since there is no law which orders a grant of financial assistance
and furthermore, the order of the Labor Arbiter for the reinstatement of the
petitioners is inconsistent with an award of financial assistance; and 2) that
the award has no factual basis since the company acted in good faith in
acceding to the request of the union president for the termination of the
services of the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Public
respondents claim that the company was compelled to dismiss the petitioners
upon request of the union president pursuant to the clear terms of the CBA
which is considered the law between the contracting parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the NLRC, the company was in no
position to question the statue of <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span> as Union
president as the matter pertains exclusively to the Union and its members
[Memorandum for the Public Respondent, pp. 6-9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 153-156.]</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be stressed that both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC
were of the opinion that the company did not act in bad faith in terminating
the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in directing the
reinstatement of petitioners without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> but
ordering the company to extend financial assistance, the Labor Arbiter
explained:</p>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>The record shows that <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span> unconditionally resigned on April 4, 1982 (Annex
"A" to complainants’ position papers), which resignation was formally
and unconditionally accepted thru a board resolution on April 5, 1982 (Annex
"B").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The National President
of the National Federation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of Labor to
which the local union, <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Malayang</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries, is
affiliated wrote a letter to <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span> calling her attention to a letter dated July 30,
1982 addressed to the members of the local union and which she circulated,
purporting to expel from the union 12 ranking officers and members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He informed her that she has been divested of
all authority to act as president of the local union so that she no longer has
authority to expel any union member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
present leadership of the local union is being exercised by a steering
committee, a collective body, the primary duty of which is to continue the work
which should have been exercised by competent union officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This committee was created by general
membership meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is crystal clear
from the foregoing that the dismissal of complainants has been requested by one
who no longer had the authority to do the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, respondent corporation may <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> dismiss complainants if there is a
legal cause.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In this case, the respondent firm was <span class="SpellE">influnced</span>
(sic) by a former union president who misrepresented herself as still the union
president.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>respondent</u> <u>company</u>,
<u>therefore</u>, <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>deemed</u> <u>to</u> <u>have</u> <u>acted</u>
<u>in</u> <u>bad</u> <u>faith</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the complainants, from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the
foregoing facts, are entitled reinstatement because they were blamed for having
resigned from or were expelled by their union which is not true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Since</u> <u>the</u> <u>respondent</u> <u>corporation</u>
<u>not</u> <u>in</u> <u>bad</u> <u>faith</u> <u>in</u> <u>dismissing</u> <u>them</u>,

pp. 25-26;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> Underscoring supplied.]<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC, on the other hand, was even more categorical in
declaring that the company acted in good faith in complying with the request of
the union president:</p>

<blockquote>Under the collective bargaining agreement, any employee who resigns
from the union or is expelled <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> in accordance
with the constitution and by-laws for non-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">payment
of union dues or for disloyalty to the union, shall be suspended and/or
dismissed by the company upon written request of the union and upon consent of
the company.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the circumstances mentioned above, we are inclined to believe
that the respondent, <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>., Inc. <u>has</u> <u>acted</u> <u>in</u> <u>good</u> <u>faith</u>
<u>in</u> <u>terminating</u> <u>the</u> <u>services</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>complainants</u><i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></i>Because of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">union security provision of the collective bargaining agreement, said
respondent duty bound to dismiss them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the company had earlier received a letter from the National
Federation of Labor, informing about the affiliation of the local union with
that </span>federation, there is also on record a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> petition signed by a majority of the workers in the company, rejecting
the resignation of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span>
as president and giving her the authority to solve the workers’ problems </span>in
the company (Exhibit "2-Cn".) It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">significant to note that neither the steering committee nor the
federation opposed the </span>request of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span> to terminate the services of the complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of this lack of opposition,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.,
Inc. has reason to assume and/or to believe that <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span> still represented the union or has the
authority to act for the union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>We</u>
<u>consider</u> <u>this</u> <u>as</u> <u>(sic)</u> <u>act</u> <u>of</u> <u>good</u>
<u>faith</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>part</u> <u>of</u> <u>respondents</u>, <u>hence</u>,
<u>the</u> <u>award</u> <u>of</u> <u>financial</u> <u>assistance</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>complainants</u> <u>equivalent</u> <u>to</u> <u>six</u> <u>months</u> <u>salaries</u>
<u>has</u> <u>no</u> <u>basis</u>, <u>factual</u> <u>or</u> <u>legal</u> <u>and</u>
<u>is</u> <u>hereby</u> <u>deleted</u> [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
31- 32; Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The labor officials’ findings on this factual matter are
conclusive upon the Court under the well-settled doctrine that factual findings
of quasi-judicial agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality if
supported by substantial evidence [Packaging Products Corporation v. National
Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 50383, July 23, 1987, 152 SCRA 210;
Edi-Staff Builders International, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>,
Jr., G.R. No. 71907, July 30, 1987; <span class="SpellE">Almoite</span> v.
Pacific Architects &amp; Engineers, Inc., G.R. No. 73680, July 10, 1986, 142
SCRA 623.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> finding of
good faith on the part of the company, the Court holds that there is no factual
or legal basis for an order against the company to grant either <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> or financial assistance in the form of separation
pay to petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is because
under settled law and jurisprudence, the company is not considered guilty of
unfair labor practice if it merely complied in good faith with the request of
the certified union for the dismissal of employees expelled from the union
pursuant to the union security clause in the Collective Bargaining Agreement
(CBA)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a>
[Seno v. Mendoza, G.R. No. L-20565, November 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1124.] To order <span class="SpellE">Shellwood</span> Industries Philippines, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to grant financial assistance to petitioners
would in effect be penalizing the company for its lawful compliance with the
CBA provisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
decision can hardly be considered tainted by the arbitrariness or unfairness
that is the essence of grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>. . . "(G]rave abuse of
discretion" means such capricious and arbitrary exercise of judgment as is
equivalent, in the eyes of the law, to lack of jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos v. Province of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
67 Phil. 480; <span class="SpellE">Hamoy</span> v. Secretary of Agriculture, G.R.
No. L-13456, January 30, 1960, 106 Phil. 1046.) An error of judgment committed
by a court in the exercise of its legitimate jurisdiction is not the same as
"grave abuse of discretion".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact even an abuse of discretion is not sufficient by
itself to justify the issuance of a writ of <i>certiorari. </i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>For that purpose, the abuse of discretion must
be grave and patent, and it must be shown that the discretion was exercised
arbitrarily or despotically . . . (<span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> Luna Inc.
v. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span>, 67 Phil. 340; <span class="SpellE">Alafriz</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span>, 72 Phil. 278.) (Palma v. Q. &amp; S., Inc.,
<u>et</u> <u>al</u>., G.R. No. L-20366, May 19, 1966, 17 SCRA 97.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Absent a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion on the part
of public respondents in deleting the award of financial assistance, the
petition must perforce fail.</p>
