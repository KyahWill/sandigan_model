				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the defunct Circuit Criminal Court of Manila, an information for estafa was filed against TERESA L. JALANDONI. It alleged: <blockquote> <p>"That in or about and during the period comprised between September 8, 9 and 10, 1976, inclusive, in the city of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to defraud, and with grave abuse of confidence reposed upon her by the Bank of the Philippine Islands, a banking institution duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, engaged in the general banking business in said City, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud said bank by means of the following fraudulent acts and false pretenses, to wit: the said accused making use of a current account she had earlier opened in the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation Greenhills Branch, current account No. 6-06061, issued against said account the following personal checks paid to cash, to wit:</p> <blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="30%"><em>Check No.</em></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="center"><em>Amount</em></div></td> <td width="50%">&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424526</td> <td width="16%"> <div align="right">P 300,000.00</div></td> <td width="4%"> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424527</td> <td> <div align="right">200,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424528</td> <td> <div align="right">250,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424529</td> <td> <div align="right">300,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424530</td> <td> <div align="right">200,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424531</td> <td> <div align="right">150,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424532</td> <td> <div align="right">300,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424533</td> <td> <div align="right">200,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>RCBC 2424534</td> <td> <div align="right">250,000.00</div></td> <td> <div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote> <p>all in the total amount of TWO MILLION ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P2,150,000.00), Philippine currency, the accused knowing fully well that she did not have sufficient funds to cover the total amount of her said personal checks which she then deposited in the Bank of the Philippine Islands, Mandaluyong Branch, for credit to her current account No. 2274-1 in the Bank of the Philippine Islands, Plaza Cervantes Branch, and even before her said personal checks could be collected and cleared by the Bank of the Philippine Islands, Plaza Cervantes Branch, the said accused, by means of false statements and fraudulent representations made to the Manager, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Plaza Cervantes Branch, to the effect that her said deposited personal checks are good and covered with sufficient funds and would be honored by the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation Greenhills Branch, the drawee bank thereof, and by means of other similar deceits induced and succeeded in inducing the Manager of the Bank of the Philippine Islands Plaza Cervantes Branch, to honor checks drawn by her against her said deposited personal checks, in favor of other parties in the aggregate amount of P2,041,780.00, the said accused knowing fully well that all her said pretenses and representations were false and untrue for the reason that upon presentation of her said deposited personal checks to the drawee bank Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Greenhills Branch, for payment, the said checks, with the exception of RCBC No. 2424530 in the amount of P200,000.00, were dishonored and payment thereof refused, the drawer thereof, accused herein, not having the funds to cover the amount of her said personal checks, and the said accused notwithstanding due notice to her from the Bank of the Philippine Islands of said dishonor and demands from the same bank to make good her dishonored personal checks, failed and refused to deposit the necessary amount to cover the amounts of her dishonored personal checks or the amounts of the checks drawn by her in favor of other persons, which had been honored by the Bank of the Philippine Islands Plaza Cervantes Branch on the strength of her said false pretenses and fraudulent representations that her deposited personal checks against which they were drawn, were good and covered with sufficient funds, to the damage and prejudice of the Bank of the Philippine Islands as represented by Mr. Alberto F. de Villa Abrille its President in the sum of at least P1,391,780.00, Philippine Currency." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 1-2)</p></blockquote> <p>After trial, the court rendered the following judgment:</p> <blockquote> <p>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of estafa defined under Article 315, 2(a), and hereby sentences her to a penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>; to indemnify the bank of the Philippine Islands, Cervantes Branch, in the sum of P1,600,000.00 representing the balance of the amount which she swindled from the said bank; and to pay the costs." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 603.)</p></blockquote> <p>The case is now before Us on appeal.</p> <p>The People's version of the facts is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"On July 30, 1962, the spouses, H. M. Jalandoni and appellant Teresa Jalandoni, opened a joint current account with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI, for short), Plaza Cervantes Branch and were assigned current account No. 2274-1.</p> <p>"On November 22, 1973, after the death of husband H. M. Jalandoni, Ma. Theresa Macapagal, daughter of appellant herein, replaced her father as co-owner with her mother, of current account No. 2274-1.</p> <p>"Appellant Teresa Jalandoni, likewise, opened a current account with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC, for short), Greenhills Branch and was assigned current account No. 6-06061.</p> <p>"On September 8, 1976, appellant Teresa Jalandoni drew three checks totalling P750,000.00, all payable to cash, against her current account No. 6-06061 with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation and deposited same in her current account No. 2274-1, with the Bank of the Philippine Islands Plaza Cervantes Branch. Prior to, or simultaneously, with, said deposit, she issued 25 checks in the total amount of P745,980.00 which the drawee bank honored, and paid, on her assurance made to the bank manager that the RCBC checks which she had issued and deposited were funded. At the same time and upon appellant's request, the bank returned to her the other eleven checks which were also issued against her current account No. 2274-1.</p> <p>"On September 9, 1976, appellant drew three checks totalling P650,000.00, all payable to cash, against her current account No. 6-06061 with the RCBC, and deposited the same in her current account No. 2274-1, with the BPI, Cervantes Branch. Prior to, or simultaneous with, said deposit, appellant, likewise, issued 26 checks totalling P639,700.00, which the drawee bank honored and paid on the same date of deposit, on her assurance made to the bank manager that the RCBC checks which she had issued and deposited were funded. Again, on the same date, and upon her request, the bank returned to her the other eleven checks which were also issued against her current account No. 2274-1.</p> <p>"On September 10, 1976, appellant for the third time drew three checks, totalling P750,000.00 all payable to cash against her current account No. 6-06061 with the RCBC, and deposited the same with her current account No. 2274-1 with the BPI, Cervantes Branch. Again, prior to, or simultaneously with, said deposit, she issued 22 checks in the total amount of P656,100.00 which the drawee bank honored and paid on the same date of deposit, on her assurance made to the bank manager that the RCBC checks which she had issued and deposited were funded. At the same time, and upon her request, the bank manager returned to her the other six checks which she also issued against her current account No. 2274-1.</p> <p>"All of the above RCBC checks except Check No. 2424530, in the amount of P200,000.00, when presented for payment were dishonored for lack of sufficient funds.</p> <p>"The appellant does not question the veracity of the transactions, but alleges as a defense that she had been previously granted an overdraft, and that it was not her intention to defraud the bank." (Brief, pp. 2-4.)</p></blockquote> <p>The People's statement that the appellant does not question the veracity of the transactions is true. In fact, the appellant makes the following admissions:</p> <blockquote> <p>"(a) accused-appellant issued nine (9) RCBC personal checks;</p> <p>(b) the sum total of the face value of said nine (9) checks is P2,150,000.00;</p> <p>(c) of said nine (9) checks, one (1) was honored, namely, RCBC check No. 2424530 in the amount of P200,000.00, when the checks went through clearing;</p> <p>(d) the checks drawn by accused-appellant against said personal checks aggregated P2,041,780.00;</p> <p>(e) said checks were drawn in favor of third parties, not the accused-appellant; and</p> <p>(f) out of the P2,150,000.00 worth of the nine (9) checks involved, the damage suffered is only P1,391,780.00." (Brief, pp. 5-6.)</p></blockquote> <p>The crucial question which has to be resolved is whether or not the appellant acted fraudulently in her transactions with the Plaza Cervantes Branch of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI).</p> <p>We hold that the appellant did not act fraudulently.</p> <p>The record shows that the appellant had been accorded overdraft (OD) or drawn against uncollected deposit (DAUD) privileges, not just for the nine (9) RCBC checks mentioned in the information, but for many other past transactions. Why she was accorded the privileges was explained by Manuel L. Garcia who was the manager of the Plaza Cervantes branch of BPI when the transactions took place. He said:</p> <blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">[Atty.

(TSN, July 19, 1979, pp. 106-107.)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote> <p>Eriberto M. Ignacio who first testified on February 18, 1980, and who became manager of the Plaza Cervantes branch of BPI in November, 1976, succeeding Manager Garcia, was also utilized as a defense witness.

Garcia was not accused as a co-principal. During the hearing held on January 12, 1983, the Court was informed that Mr. Garcia was allowed to retire. If the appellant had in fact acted fraudulently she could not have done so without the active cooperation of Mr. Garcia. Hence, if Mr. Garcia was innocent of any criminal act, the same can be said for the appellant.</p> <p>Other circumstances militate against the imputation of fraud. The circumstances have been stated by the appellant thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>"[I]f the accused-appellant had criminal intent to defraud aforethought-</p> <p>(a) why did she still fund or allow to be honored one of the nine (9) checks involved in the amount of P200,000.00?</p> <p>(b) why did she draw the checks aggregating P2,041,780.00, drawn against the nine (9) checks, in favor of third parties, instead of withdrawing said amount of P2,041,780.00 for herself?</p> <p>(c) why did she minimize or reduce the resulting damage to complainant bank to P1,391,780.00 (actually much less as will he shown later), instead of grabbing the full value of the nine (9) checks in question, which is P2,150,000.00?" (Brief, p. 6.)</p></blockquote> <p>It is to be noted that the nine (9) RCBC checks had a total face value of P2,150,000.00. One of the checks with a face value of P200,000.00 was honored, leaving an initial balance of P1,950,000.00. However, the appellant was able to reduce this balance by other payments to BPI such that in the judgment she was ordered to pay only the amount of P1,600,000.00. Upon the other hand, the appellant claims that the resulting damage to BPI was reduced to P1,391,780.00. The appellant states without contradiction "that, with the authority of her son, she mortgaged to the bank a lot belonging to the latter for a loan of P250,000.00, which was applied to one of the dishonored checks in dispute, as shown by Exhibits 37 (promissory note signed by the son), 37-a (real estate mortgage), 37-b (Trans. Cert. of Title No. T-71084), 37-c (Special Power of Attorney), and 38 (check for P250,000.00); additionally, she also gave the president of the bank, Mr. Alberto F. de Villa-Abrille, a family friend, jewelry worth P300,000.00 as a token of her sincerity to pay (Id., pp. 13-17, 19-28). If the accused-appellant had the criminal intent to defraud the bank, would she have encumbered the property of her son, obviously worth more than P250,000.00? Would she have given up jewelry worth P300,000.00? (Brief, pp. 15-16.)</p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the guilt of the appellant not having been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt, the appealed judgment is hereby set aside and another one is entered acquitting her of the charge. No costs.</p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p><em>Aquino, Concepcion Jr., Guerrero, De Castro</em> and <em>Escolin, JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Makasiar (Chairman), J.,</em> see dissent.<br><br><br> <hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <div align="center"><br><br><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></div> <p><strong>MAKASIAR, J.:</strong></p> <p>The conviction of the accused herein should be affirmed. It is amply proven that the personal checks drawn by her in favor of other persons had been honored by the Bank of the Philippine Islands, Plaza Cervantes Branch, because of her active false pretenses and fraudulent representations to the branch manager that her deposited personal checks against which they were drawn, were good and covered with sufficient funds, when in fact they were not so covered.</p></div>
