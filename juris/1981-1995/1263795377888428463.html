				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Involved in this case is an attempt by a daughter to claim her
share in her father's estate some sixty-three years after the latter's
demise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The father, Andres Arroyo, died
sometime in 1901.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He left an estate
apparently of no mean size, comprised of properties located mainly in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was survived by three compulsory
heirs:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Felix Arroyo, a legitimate son by
his first wife, and <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Arroyo and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Arroyo, legitimate children by his second
wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Administration of his estate was
assumed and undertaken by Felix Arroyo, as the oldest son, evidently without
objection from his brother or sister.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 19, 1964, his daughter, the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span>
<span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Arroyo, then already 84 years of age and a
widow, together with her six (6) children,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed suit in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
seeking to recover from the estate of the late Spouses Anita de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Villanueva, Sr. and their children, what she
claimed to be one-third (1/3) of the properties left by her deceased
father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her complaint alleged that her
share in the inheritance had at all times been held in trust by Felix Arroyo
and after his death, by his heirs and successors-in-interest, who are the
defendants named in her complaint, and she had been deprived of that share
through fraud and misrepresentation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
also prayed for an accounting of the fruits of the inheritance and the payment
to her of her proportionate share in those fruits as might be warranted by the
results of the accounting.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant Anita de Leon was the granddaughter of Felix Arroyo
by his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Villanueva
was her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They moved to dismiss
the complaint on several grounds:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>failure of the complaint to state a cause of action, <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>, <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, release, and bar by the statute of
limitations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Trial Court sustained
the motion and dismissed the action, by Order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It also directed the Register of Deeds of Iloilo, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, etc., to cancel the annotation of <span class="SpellE"><i>lis</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">pendens</span></i> caused to be made by the plaintiffs on
all the certificates of title of the land involved in the litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appeal was timely perfected by the plaintiffs to the Court of
Appeals in <i>forma pauperis</i>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> But the appeal was, by resolution
dated <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1968</st1:date>,
forwarded to this Court pursuant to Section 3, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court,
avowedly because the appeal raised only questions of law, and the amount in
controversy exceeded the amount of P200,000.00 and hence fell within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Assigned by the appellants as errors of the Court <i>a quo</i>
are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) its having sustained the motion
to dismiss on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>, release and <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
in complete disregard of the appellants' refutation thereof; and (2) depriving
them in the process of their day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> was anchored on a prior judgment rendered in
Civil Case No. 7862 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That case related to the
division of the estate of Andres Arroyo, and the judgment was rendered on the
basis of a compromise agreement entered into by the parties entitled <span class="SpellE"><i>Convenio</i></span><i> de <span class="SpellE">Transaccion</span></i>,
dated <st1:date year="1940" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1940</st1:date>,
subscribed by the late Spouses Anita de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
Villanueva, as well as by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Arroyo
herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the
doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>
is inapplicable because between the two (2) cases -- Civil Case No. 7200 and
the earlier one, Civil Case No. 7862 -- there was, in the first place, no
identity in subject matter -- the first being concerned exclusively with the
share of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Arroyo, <span class="SpellE">Filomena's</span>
brother, consisting of one-third (1/3) of the estate in controversy, which was
distinct from the third claimed by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> in the
later action -- and, in the second place, no identity in cause of action --
since Case No. 7862 involved the naked claim of ownership while the later,
Civil Case No. 7200, involved among others trusteeship, and fraud, in addition
to the claim of ownership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellants further argue that the <span class="SpellE"><i>Convenio</i></span><i>
de <span class="SpellE">Transaccion</span></i> could not operate as a release of
their claims to the estate, or as <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to assert
the same, because <span class="SpellE">Filomena's</span> consent to the <span class="SpellE"><i>convenio</i></span> or agreement had been procured through
fraud, misrepresentation, deceit and undue influence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants further contend that in view
of the summary dismissal of their complaint, they had been deprived of the
opportunity to prove their case on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal must be resolved adversely to the
plaintiffs-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grounds
relied upon by the Trial Court are justified by the facts on record, chiefly
appearing in indubitable documents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These facts are hereunder briefly narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Civil Case No. 7200</b>, whence the present appeal was taken,
was not, as already intimated, the first action brought by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
Arroyo against the aforementioned Anita de Leon and her husband, <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Villanueva.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An earlier suit had been instituted by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
Arroyo in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1938" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1938</st1:date> by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> and her late husband, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buncio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Joined
with them as co-plaintiffs in that action were the children and heirs of her
half-brother <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Arroyo, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> and Emilio Arroyo (the latter being later
substituted by his mother <span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span> Agnes Arroyo, upon
his death after the filing of the action).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also joined as co-plaintiffs were <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> and
Rude Arroyo, the children and heirs of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
Arroyo, Jr., a son of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Arroyo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Named defendants were the aforesaid spouses,
Anita de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Villanueva.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The suit was docketed as <b>Civil Case No.
7862</b>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1940" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1940</st1:date>,
the parties executed a compromise agreement entitled <span class="SpellE"><i>Convenio</i></span><i>
de <span class="SpellE">Transaccion</span></i>, which they acknowledged before a
notary public.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
By it, the <span class="SpellE">Buncio</span> Spouses and their co-plaintiffs
sold, transferred and conveyed all their rights, title and interests over all
the properties involved in the litigation in favor of the defendant spouses,
Anita and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Villanueva.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same day the parties filed a <i>Peticion</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
with the Court praying that judgment be rendered in accordance with their <span class="SpellE"><i>convenio</i></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This the Court did the following day, <st1:date year="1940" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1940</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1946" day="14" month="3">March 14,
 1946</st1:date> (after Liberation), the plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate
the decision of <st1:date year="1940" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1940</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a>
They alleged as grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> fraud,
misrepresentation, deceit and undue influence vitiating their consent to the <span class="SpellE"><i>Convenio</i></span> <i>de</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>Transaccion</i></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied, by Order dated <st1:date year="1946" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1946</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a>
The plaintiffs took steps to elevate the matter to a higher court by filing an
"Exception and Notice of Appeal" dated <st1:date year="1946" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1946</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a> But on <st1:date year="1946" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1946</st1:date> the Court <i>a quo</i>
dismissed the appeal sought to be taken by them for the reason that the
requisite record on appeal and appeal bond had not been presented on time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">8</span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">Buncios</span> apparently took no further steps to
impugn the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meanwhile
the Court rendered another decision dated August 17, 1949,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">9</span></span></a>
this time approving a "Compromise Agreement" executed on August 18,
1949 between <span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span> Agnes, and <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Arroyo (the co-plaintiffs of the <span class="SpellE">Buncio</span> Spouses),<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">10</span></span></a>
on the one hand, and the spouses Anita de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
Villanueva, on the other, and on the basis thereof, declaring the latter once
again<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">11</span></span></a>
the exclusive and absolute owners of all the property subject of the
litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon these facts the application of the familiar doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></i> is
authorized as against <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Arroyo <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Buncio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment in Civil Case No. 7862 operates
as an absolute bar to Civil Case No. 7200, instituted twenty-four (24) years
after its rendition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All the requisites
for the application of the doctrine are present:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> (1) the judgment in the first case
was a final one, and had become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; (2) it was
rendered by a court having jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties;
and (3) between the two (2) cases --- i.e., that in which said judgment was
rendered (Civil Case No. 7862) and that in the case at bar (Civil Case No.
7200) --- there exists identity of parties, of subject-matter, and of causes of
action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Some words anent the third requisite would not be
inappropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The identity as to
parties between the two cases, CC No. 7862 and CC No. 7200, is quite
palpable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs in the earlier
case, <b>CC No. 7862</b> were <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Arroyo and her
husband, and the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Filomena's</span> brother, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Arroyo (three [3] children and two [2]
grandchildren).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs in <b>CC No.
7200</b> were the self-same <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Arroyo, then
already widowed, and her six (6) children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of <span class="SpellE">Filomena's</span>
children was improper, a superfluity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They had no rights whatever in the estate of their grandfather, Felix
Arroyo, except such as they might derive from their mother, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>,
upon her death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The identity as to
parties defendant is even plainer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
both suits, the defendants were the Spouses Anita de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Villanueva, except that in the second action,
joined with them as defendants were their children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of the Villanueva children was unnecessary and improper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were neither indispensable nor proper.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> No
right of action was asserted against them personally and directly; and any
liability they might conceivably have to the plaintiffs could result only from
their being heirs of their parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
would seem that the inclusion of superfluous parties plaintiffs and defendants
in the action was designed to avoid the application of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></i> as a bar to the second suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">So, too, the identity as to the subject-matter in both actions is
fairly evident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The property involved in
<b>CC No. 7862</b> consisted of registered lands located in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
(Province and City) and <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same registered parcels of land were
subject of the later action, <b>CC No. 7200</b>, except that a few other
parcels of land were included in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="SpellE">Filomena's</span> asserted causes of
action in both cases were exactly the same:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>the recovery of her hereditary share in the estate of her father, the
late Andres Arroyo, which she claimed to have been withheld from her by her
brother, Felix, and the latter's heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The applicability of the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></i> cannot therefore be seriously
contested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its application cannot be
avoided by the addition in the second suit of unnecessary parties,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> or
the assertion of new issues which could have been set up in the prior action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection account should be taken of the cognate
principle that <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></i>
operates to bar not only the re-litigation in a subsequent action of the issues
squarely raised, passed upon and adjudicated in the first suit, but also the
ventilation in said subsequent suit of any other issue which could have been
raised in the first but was not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law
provides that "the judgment or order is, with respect to the matter
directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in
relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in
interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action ** litigating
for the same thing and in the same capacity."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
So, even if new causes of action are asserted in the second action (e.g.,
fraud, deceit, undue machinations in connection with their execution of the <span class="SpellE"><i>convenio</i></span><i> de <span class="SpellE">transaccion</span></i>),
this would not preclude the operation of the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those issues are also barred, even if not passed upon in the first.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They could have been, but were not, there
raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it were legally possible to shunt aside and ignore the
principle of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>,
this would not help the appellants' cause one whit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their cause of action for the annulment of
their <span class="SpellE"><i>convenio</i></span><i> de <span class="SpellE">transaccion</span></i>
on the ground of fraud, undue influence, or mistake, as also their cause of
action for recovery of property on the theory of constructive trust, assuming
their tenability, would nonetheless be barred by another insuperable legal
obstacle:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action to annul a contract on the ground that consent is
vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud
prescribes in four (4) years;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> and the period is reckoned, in case
of mistake or fraud, from the time of the discovery of the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> It
is noteworthy that as early as <st1:date year="1946" day="14" month="3">March
 14, 1946</st1:date> the appellants already had pleaded fraud in the motion
filed by them on that day to set aside the judgment rendered in Civil Case No.
7268:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>their contention was that their
consent to the <span class="SpellE"><i>convenio</i></span> <i>de</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>transaccion</i></span>, which the judgment had approved, had
been obtained by fraud, or undue machinations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is thus not unreasonable, surely, to consider <st1:date year="1946" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1946</st1:date> as the day of the discovery of the
fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So considered, it should at once
be apparent that the prescriptive period of four (4) years had long elapsed
when Civil Case No. 7200 was instituted by the appellants on February 19, 1964,
eighteen (18) years afterwards.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alternatively categorizing the appellants' cause of action as one
for recovery of property held by defendants under a constructive trust, would
not improve their situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statute
of limitations would still preclude their success.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming the creation of an implied trust
over the real property in question from the time that Felix Arroyo (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' <span class="SpellE">precedessor</span>) took over
possession and administration thereof sometime in 1901, the period of
prescription to recover the property --- set by law at ten (10) years --- began
to run from the time that Torrens titles were obtained over the property in the
name of the trustee or his successors-in-interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The governing principle was just recently restated
in definitive terms by this Court in its decision in <span class="SpellE"><i>Amerol</i></span><i>,
et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Bagumbaran</span></i>., promulgated on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1987</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"An action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> based on
an implied or constructive trust must perforce prescribe in ten years and not
otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A long line of decisions of
this Court, and of very recent vintage at that, illustrates this rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, it is now well-settled that an
