				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the March
14, 1985 Decision of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> L. Ruiz
which held that herein private respondent Rogelio R. <span class="SpellE">Coria</span>
was illegally dismissed; and of the Resolution of the National Labor Relations
Commission which dis­missed petitioner's appeal on the ground that the same was
filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">In August, 1977, herein private respondent Rogelio R. <span class="SpellE">Coria</span> was hired by herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Empire Insurance Group as a casual employee with a salary of P10.00 a day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1978</st1:date>, he was made <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>regular
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">employee,
having been appointed as clerk-typist, with a monthly salary of P300.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being a permanent employee, he was furnished
a copy of petitioner company's "General Information, Office Behavior and
Other Rules and Regula­tions".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the same year, without change in his posi­tion-designation, he was transferred
to the Claims Department and his salary was increased to P450.00 a month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1980, he was transferred to the Underwriting
Depart­ment and his salary was increased to P580.00 a month plus cost of living
allowance, until he was transferred to the Fire Department as filing
clerk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In July, 1983, he was made an
inspector of the Fire Division with a monthly salary of P685.00 plus allowances
and other bene­fits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 15, 1983, private respondent Rogelio R. <span class="SpellE">Coria</span> was dismissed from work, allegedly, on the grounds of
tardiness and unexcused absences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accord­ingly,
he filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE), and in a
Decision dated <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1985</st1:date>
(Record, pp. 80-87), Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> L. Ruiz
reinstated him to his position with back wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner filed an appeal with the National Labor Rela­tions Commission
(NLRC) but, in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="11">Novem­ber
 15, 1985</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp.
31-32), the appeal was dismissed on the ground that the same had been filed out
of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 2-22).</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the resolution of the Second Division of this
Court dated <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1986</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 94)<span class="GramE">,</span> private respondent filed his Comment on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1986</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 97-101) and public respondent on <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1986</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
120-124).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioners filed their Reply to private respondent's Comment (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 102-105) and on <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1986</st1:date>,
their Reply to public respondent's Comment (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 126-131).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="8">August
 18, 1986</st1:date>, the Second Division of this Court resolved to give due
course to the petition and to require the parties to submit their respective
memoranda (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 132).</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the above mentioned Resolution, petitioners
filed their memorandum on <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="11">November
 10, 1986</st1:date>; while private respondent filed his Memorandum on <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1986</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. <span class="GramE">139-144),</span> and public respondent on <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1986</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 160-166).</p>

<p class="BODY">Before going however, into the merits of the case, an important
point to consider is whether or not it is still within the jurisdiction of this
Court to review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Rule VIII of the Revised Rules
of the National Labor Relations Commission on appeal, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>- Decision or orders of a Labor Arbiter shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> unless appealed to the Commis­sion by <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">any </span>or both of the parties within ten
(10) calendar days from receipt of notice thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 6.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>No extension of period</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No motion or request for extension of the
period within which to perfect an appeal shall be entertained."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the employer (petitioner herein) received a
copy of the decision of the Labor Arbiter on <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
filed a Motion for Exten<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

 bold">April 11, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> and filed the Memorandum of Appeal on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
 mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">April 22, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the "no extension
policy" of the Na­tional Labor Relations Commission, aforesaid motion for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">extension </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of time was denied
in its resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">November 15, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> and the appeal was
dismissed for having been filed out of time (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 31-32).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim, among other things, that respon­dent
Commission committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction in arbitrarily dismiss­ing petitioners' appeal on a technicality (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
invokes the Rules of Court provision on liberal construction of the Rules in the
interest of substantial justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted however, that the foregoing provi­sion refers to
the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
the Revised Rules of the National Labor Relations Commis<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">sion are clear and explicit and leave no room for interpretation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is an elementary rule in administra­tive law that
administrative regulations and policies enacted by administrative bodies to
interpret the law which they are entrusted to enforce, have the force of law,
and are entitled to great respect (<span class="SpellE">Espanol</span> v. Phi­lippine
Veterans Administration, 137 SCRA 314 [1985]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the above-quoted provisions of the Revised NLRC Rules, the
decision appealed from in this case has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and can no longer be subject to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the merits, the ruling of the Labor Arbiter appears to be
correct; the consistent promotions in rank and salary of the private respondent
indicate he must have been a highly efficient worker, who should be re­tained
despite occasional lapses in punctuality and attendance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perfection cannot after all be demanded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition is DISMISSED.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
