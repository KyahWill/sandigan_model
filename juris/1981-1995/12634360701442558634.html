<p class="BODY">On 5 November 1977, the 79-year old Brigido Alvarado executed a
notarial will entitled "Huling Habilin" wherein he disinherited an
illegitimate son (petitioner) and expressly revoked a previously executed
holographic will at the time awaiting probate before Branch of the Regional
Trial Court of Sta. Cruz, Laguna.</p>

<p class="BODY">As testified to by the three instrumental witnesses, the notary
public and by private respondent who were present at the execution, the
testator did not read the final draft of the will himself.  Instead, private respondent, as the lawyer
who drafted the eight-paged document, read the same aloud in the presence of
the testator, the three instrumental witnesses and the notary public.  The latter four followed the reading with
their own respective <span style="">copies </span>previously furnished them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Brigido's holographic will was subsequently admitted
to probate on 9 December 1977.  On the
29th day of the same month, a codicil entitled "Kasulatan ng Pagbabago sa
Ilang Pagpapasiya na Nasasaad sa Huling Habilin na May Petsa Nobiembre 5, 1977
ni Brigido Alvarado" was executed changing some dispositions in the
notarial will to generate cash for the testator's eye operation.  Brigido was then suffering from
glaucoma.  But the disinheritance and
revocatory clauses were unchanged.  As
in the case of the notarial will, the testator did not personally read the
final draft of the codicil.  Instead, it
was private respondent who read it aloud in his presence and in the presence of
the three instrumental witnesses (same as those of the notarial will) and the
notary public who followed the reading using their own copies.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A petition for the
probate of the notarial will and </span>codicil was filed upon the testator's
death on 3 January 1979 by private respondent as executor with the Court of
First Instance, now Regional Trial Court, of Siniloan, Laguna.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner, in turn, filed an Opposition <span style="">on
the </span>following grounds:  that the
will <span style="">sought to be probated </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">not executed and attested as </span>required
by law; <span style="">that the testator </span>was
insane or otherwise <span style="">mentally
incapacitated to make </span>a will <span style="">at
the </span>time of <span style="">its </span>execution due to senility and <span style="">old age; that the </span>will <span style="">was
executed under duress, or influence of </span>fear or threats; that it was <span style="">procured by undue and improper pressure and </span>influence
<span style="">on the part of the beneficiary who
stands to get the lion's share of the testator's estate; and lastly, that the
signature of the </span>testator was <span style="">procured
by fraud or trick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When the </span>oppositor
(petitioner) failed to substantiate <span style="">the
grounds </span>relied upon in <span style="">the
Opposition, a Probate Order <span style="">was </span>issued
on 27 June 1983 from which an appeal was made to respondent court.  The main thrust of the appeal was that the
deceased was blind within the meaning of the law at the time his "Huling
Habilin" and the codicil attached thereto were executed; that since the
reading required by Art. 808 of the Civil Code was admittedly not complied
with, probate of the deceased's last will and codicil should have been denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 11 April 1986, the
Court of Appeals rendered the decision under review with the following
findings:  that Brigido Alvarado was not
blind at the time his last will and codicil were executed; that assuming his
blindness, the reading requirement of Art. 808 was substantially complied with
when both documents were read aloud to the testator with each of the three
instrumental witnesses and the notary public following the reading with their
respective copies of the instruments.  The appellate court then concluded that although Art. 808 was not
followed to the letter, there was substantial compliance since its purpose of
making known to the testator the contents of the drafted will was served.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issues now before us can be stated thus:  Was Brigido Alvarado blind for purposes of
Art. 808 at the time his "Huling Habilin" and its codicil were
executed?  If so, was the double-reading
requirement of said article complied with?</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the first issue, there is no dispute on the following
facts:  Brigido Alvarado was not totally
blind at the time the will and codicil were executed.  However, his vision on both eyes was only of "counting
fingers at three (3) feet" by reason of the glaucoma which he had been
suffering from for several years and even prior to his first consultation with
an eye specialist on 14 December 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point of dispute is whether the <span style="">foregoing </span>circumstances would qualify Brigido as a
"blind" testator under Art. 808 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 808.  If the
testator is blind, the will shall be read to him twice; once, by one of the
subscribing witnesses, and again, by the notary public before whom the will is
acknowledged.‚Äù</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that although his father was not totally
blind when the will and codicil were executed, he can be so considered within
the scope of the term as it is used in Art. 808.  To support his stand, petitioner presented before the trial court
a medical certificate issued by Dr. Salvador R. Salceda, Director of the
Institute of Opthalmology (Philippine Eye Research institute),<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the contents <span style="">of
</span>which were interpreted in layman's terms by Dr. Ruperto Roasa, whose
expertise was admitted by private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> Dr.
Roasa explained that although the testator could visualize fingers at three (3)
feet, he could no longer read either printed or handwritten matters as of 14
December 1977, the day of his first consultation.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
Court of Appeals, contrary to the medical testimony, held that the testator
could still read on the day the will and the codicil were executed but chose
not to do so because of "poor eyesight."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Since the testator <span style="">was </span>still capable of reading at that time, the court a quo
concluded that Art. 808 need not be complied with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with petitioner
in this respect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regardless of respondent's
staunch contention that the testator was still capable of reading at the time
his will and codicil were prepared, the fact remains and this was testified to
by his witnesses, that Brigido did not do so because of his ‚Äúpoor,‚Äù</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> ‚Äúdefective,‚Äù</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or ‚Äúblurred‚Äù</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> vision making it necessary for private
respondent to do the actual reading for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following
pronouncement in <i style="">Garcia vs. Vasquez</i></span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">provides an insight into the scope of the
term "blindness" as used in Art. 808, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The rationale behind the requirement of reading the will to
the testator <u><span style="">if</span></u><span style=""> </span>he is <u><span style="">blind or </span>incapable of reading the will </u><u><span style="">himself (as </span>when he </u><u><span style="">is illiterate)</span></u><span style="">, is to make the provisions thereof known to
him, so that he may be able to object if they are not in accordance with his wishes
x x x x"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clear from the foregoing is that Art. 808 applies not only to
blind testators but also to those who, for one reason or another, are
"incapable of reading the(ir) will(s)." Since Brigido Alvarado was
incapable of reading the final drafts of his will and codicil on the separate
occasions of their execution due to his "poor,"
"defective," or "blurred" vision, there can be no other
course for us but to conclude that Brigido Alvarado comes within the scope of
the term "blind" as it is used in Art. 808.  Unless the contents were read to him, he had no way of
ascertaining whether or not the lawyer who drafted the will and codicil <span style="">did so conformably with his
instructions.  Hence, to consider his
will as validly executed and entitled to probate, it is essential that we
ascertain whether Art. 808</span> <span style="">had
been complied with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 808 requires that in case of testators like Brigido
Alvarado, the will shall be read twice; once, by one of the instrumental
witnesses and, again, by the notary public before whom the will was
acknowledged.  The purpose is to make
known to the incapacitated testator the contents of the document before signing
and to give him an opportunity <span style="">to
object if anything is contrary to his instructions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That Art. 808 was not
followed strictly is beyond cavil.  Instead of the notary public and an instrumental </span><span style="">witness, it </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">the
lawyer (private </span>respondent) who <span style="">drafted
the eight-paged will and the five-paged codicil who read the </span>same aloud
to the testator, and read them only once, not twice as Art. 808 requires.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent
however insists that there was substantial compliance and that the single
reading suffices for purposes of the law.  On the other hand, petitioner maintains that the only valid compliance
is a strict compliance or compliance to the letter and since it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">admitted that neither the notary public nor an instrumental </span><span style="">witness read the contents of </span>the will
and codicil to Brigido, probate of the latter's will and codicil should have
been disallowed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We sustain private respondent's
stand and necessarily, the petition must be denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court has held in a
number of occasions that substantial compliance is acceptable where the purpose
of the law has been satisfied, the reason being that the solemnities
surrounding the execution of wills are intended to protect the testator from
all kinds of fraud and trickery </span><span style="">but
are never intended </span><span style="">to be so
rigid and inflexible as to destroy the testamentary privilege.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, private respondent read the testator's will
and codicil aloud in the presence of the testator, his three instrumental
witnesses, and the notary public.  Prior
and subsequent thereto, the testator affirmed, upon being asked, that the
contents read corresponded with <span style="">his </span>instructions.  Only then did the signing and acknowledgement take place.  There is no evidence, and <span style="">petitioner does not so allege, that the
contents of the will and codicil were not </span>sufficiently made known and <span style="">communicated to the testator.  On the contrary, with respect to the ‚ÄúHuling
Habilin,‚Äù the day of the execution was not the first time that Brigido had
affirmed the truth and authenticity of the contents of the draft.  The uncontradicted testimony of Atty. Rino
is that Brigido Alvarado already acknowledged that the will was drafted in
accordance with his expressed wishes even prior to 5 November 1977 when Atty. </span>Rino
went to the testator's <span style="">residence
precisely for the purpose of securing his conformity </span>to <span style="">the draft.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it was not only Atty. Rino who read the documents on 5 November
and 29 December 1977.  The notary public
and the three instrumental witnesses likewise read the will and codicil, albeit
silently.  Afterwards, Atty. Nonia de la
Pena (the notary public) and Dr. Crescente O. Evidente (one of the three
instrumental witnesses and the testator's physician) asked the testator whether
the <span style="">contents of the documents were of
his </span><span style="">own </span><span style="">free will.  Brigido answered in the affirmative.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> With four persons following the reading word
for word with their own copies, it can be safely concluded that the testator
was reasonably assured that what was read to him (those which he affirmed were
in accordance with his instructions), were the terms actually appearing on the
typewritten documents.  This is
especially true when we consider the fact that the three instrumental witnesses
were persons known to the testator, one being his physician (Dr. Evidente) and
another (Potenciano C. Ranieses) being known to him since childhood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The spirit behind the law
was served though the letter was not.   Although there should be strict compliance with the substantial
requirements of the law in order to insure the authenticity of the will, </span>the
formal imperfections <span style="">should be brushed
aside when they do not affect its purpose and which, </span>when taken into <span style="">account, may only defeat the testator's will.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a final word to
convince petitioner of the propriety of the trial court's Probate Order and its
affirmance by the Court of Appeals, </span>we <span style="">quote the following pronouncement in </span><i style="">Abangan v. Abangan</i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The object of the solemnities surrounding the execution of
wills is to close the door against bad faith and fraud, to avoid the
substitution of wills and testaments and to guaranty their truth and
authenticity.  Therefore the laws on the
subject should be interpreted in such a way as to attain these primordial
ends.  But, on the other hand, also one
must not lose sight of the <span style="">fact that <u>it
is not the object of the law to restrain and curtail the exercise of the right
to make a will.  So when an interpretation
already given assures such ends, any other interpretation whatsoever, that adds
nothing but demands more requisites entirely unnecessary, useless and
frustrative of the testator's will, must be disregarded"</u> (underscoring
supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Brigido Alvarado had </span><span style="">expressed his </span><span style="">last wishes in clear and unmistakable terms in his "Huling
Habilin" and the codicil attached thereto.  We are unwilling to cast these aside for the mere reason that a
legal requirement intended for his protection was not followed strictly when
such compliance had been rendered unnecessary by the fact that the purpose of
the law, i.e., to make known to the incapacitated testator the contents of the
draft of his will, had already been accomplished.  To reiterate, substantial compliance suffices where the purpose
has been served.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
