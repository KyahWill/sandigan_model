Clark Air Base is one of the bases established and maintained by the United
States by authority of the agreement between the Philippines and the United
States concerning military bases which entered into force on March 26, 1947.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Third Combat Support Group, a unit of Clark Air Base,
maintains a Central Civilian Personnel Office (CCPO) charged with the
responsibility for civilian personnel management and administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is through its civilian personnel officer
that the base commander is responsible for direction and administration of
civilian personnel program, including advising management and operating
officials on civilian personnel matters.<span style="">&nbsp;

administrative official in charge of the activities of the CCPO, and the

a Filipino by origin and married to an American who is a member of the United

also completed all course work in human behavior and counseling psychology for
a doctoral degree; she is a civil service eligible; and, more importantly, she
had functioned as a Guidance Counselor at the Clark Air Base at the GS 1710-9

<p class="BODY">On or about October 1976, the position of Guidance Counselor, GS
1710-9, became vacant in the Base Education Office, Clark Air Base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Standard Form 52 was submitted to the
Civilian Personnel Office to fill said position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civilian Personnel Division took
immediate steps to fill the position by advertisement in the <st1:place>Clark</st1:place>
Air Base Daily Bulletin #205 dated <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of the
advertisement, one application was received by the Civilian Personnel Office
and two applications were retrieved from the applicants supply file in the
Civilian Personnel Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
applications were that of Mrs. Jean <span class="SpellE">Hollenshead</span>, an
employee of the DOD Schools at Clark Air Base, Mrs. Lydia B. <span class="SpellE">Gaillard</span>, an unemployed dependent, and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three applications were reviewed and
their experiences were considered qualifying for the advertised position.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1976</st1:date>,
the application of <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
was referred to Mr. Anthony <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>, with the applications
of Mrs. Jean <span class="SpellE">Hollenshead</span> and Mrs. Lydia <span class="SpellE">Gaillard</span>, to be considered for the position of Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counsellor</span>, GS 1710-9.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>, after review of the applications,
stated that upon screening the applications he concluded that two applicants
had what he considered minimum qualifications for the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two applicants were Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Hollenshead</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaillard</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Loida</span>
Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> felt
that her application was quite complete except for a reply to an inquiry form
attached to the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
inquiry form stated that the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>

any records on <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>,
this raised some questions in his mind as to the validity of her work
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of his
reservations on <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf's</span>
work experiences and his conclusions that the two other applications listed
minimum qualifications, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> decided to solicit
additional names for consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently in his correspondence dated <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1976</st1:date>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>
returned the three applications to the Civilian Personnel Office without a
selection decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> also requested in his correspondence that the
Civilian Personnel Office initiate immediate inquiry to the Central Oversea
Rotation and Recruiting Office (CORRO) for the submission of a list of highly
qualified candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further stated
in his correspondence that the three applicants who had indicated an interest
would be considered with the CORRO input for selection.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi's</span> request, an
AF Form 1188 "Oversee Civilian Personnel Request" was submitted to
CORRO on <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This request in fact asked for one Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counsellor</span>, GS 1710-9.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The form also listed the fact that local candidates are available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of getting a list of
candidates for consideration, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> was informed
by CORRO, through the Civilian Personnel Office in their <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1976</st1:date> message that a Mr. Edward B.
Isakson from <span class="SpellE">Loring</span> AFB, <st1:state><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:state>,
was selected for the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> stated, when informed of <span class="SpellE">CORRO's</span>
selection, that he had heard of Mr. Isakson and, from what he had heard, Mr.
Isakson was highly qualified for the position; therefore, he wished to have the
selection stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement was
denied by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>, Mr. Isakson was placed on the
rolls at Clark Air Base on <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="1">January 24,
 1977</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Said examiner, however, also stated in his findings that, by
reason of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf's</span>
credentials which he recited therein, she is and was at the time of the
vacancy,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
highly qualified for the position of Guidance Counselor, GS 1710-9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with said complaint, a Notice
of Proposed Disposition of Discrimination Complaint, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1977</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
was served upon petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> stating that because the individual selected did not
meet the criteria of the qualification requirements, it was recommended
"that an <span class="SpellE">overhire</span> GS 1710-9 Assistant Education
Advisor position be established for a 180 day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position
should be advertised for local procurement on a best qualified basis with the
stipulation that if a vacancy occurs in a permanent GS 1710-9 position the <span class="SpellE">selectee</span> would automatically be selected to fill the
vacancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a position is not vacated in
the 180 day period the temporary <span class="SpellE">overhire</span> would be
released but would be selected to fill a future vacancy if the <span class="SpellE">selectee</span> is available."</p>

<p class="BODY">During that time, private respondents already knew that a
permanent GS 1710-9 position would shortly be vacant, that is, the position of
Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> whose appointment was to expire on
August 6, 1977 and this was exactly what private respondent <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>
had in mind when he denied on June 27, 1977 Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Abalateo's</span>
request for extension of March 31, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, private respondents deny that Col. Charles J. Corey represented
to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
that she would be appointed to the <span class="SpellE">overhire</span> position
and to a permanent GS 1710-9 position as soon as it became vacant, which
allegedly prompted the latter to accept the proposed disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to her expectations, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span>
Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> was never appointed to the position occupied
by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> whose appointment was extended
indefinitely by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Feeling aggrieved by what she considered a shabby treatment
accorded her, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
wrote the U.S. Civil Service Commission questioning the qualifications of Edward
Isakson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, said commission
sent a communication addressed to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
finding Edward Isakson not qualified to the position of Guidance Counselor, GS
1710-9, and requesting that action be taken to remove him from the position and
that efforts be made to place him in a position for which he qualifies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q.
<span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> avers that said recommendation was ignored by
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span> and that Isakson
continued to occupy said position of guidance counselor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
likewise wrote the Base Commander of Clark Air Base requesting a hearing on her
complaint for discrimination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, a hearing was held on <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1978</st1:date> before the U.S. Department of Air Force in
Clark Air Base.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the Department of Air Force could render a decision,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
filed a complaint for damages, dated April 27, 1978, against private
respondents Don <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span> and Anthony <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> before the Regional Trial Court, Branch LVI at
Angeles City, docketed as Civil Case No. 2783, for the alleged discriminatory
acts of herein private respondents in maliciously denying her application for
the GS 1710-9 position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, as defendants in Civil Case No. 2783, filed
a motion to dismiss on the ground that as officers of the United States Armed
Forces performing official functions in accordance with the powers vested in
them under the Philippine-American Military Bases Agreement, they are immune
from suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss was
denied by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration was likewise denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, private respondents filed an Answer reiterating the
issue of jurisdiction and alleging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><u>,</u>
that defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi's</span> request to Central Oversea
Rotation and Recruiting Office (CORRO) was not for appointment of a person to
the position of Guidance Counselor, GS 1710-9, but for referrals whom defendant
<span class="SpellE">Persi</span> would consider together with local candidates
for the position; that the extension of the employment of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> was in accordance with applicable regulation and
was not related to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf's</span> discrimination complaint; that the decision was a
joint decision of management and CCPO reached at a meeting on June 29, 1977 and
based on a letter of the deputy director of civilian personnel, Headquarters
Pacific Air Forces, dated June 15, 1977; and that the ruling was made known to
and amplified by the director and the deputy director of civilian personnel in
letters to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
dated August 30, 1977 and September 19, 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners aver that private respondents are being sued in their
private capacity for discriminatory acts performed beyond their authority,
hence the instant action is not a suit against the United States Government
which would require its consent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, on the other hand, claim that in filing the
case, petitioners sought a judicial review by a Philippine court of the
official actuations of respondents as officials of a military unit of the U.S.
Air Force stationed at Clark Air Base.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The acts complained of were done by respondents while administering the
civil service laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts sued upon being a governmental
activity of respondents, the complaint is barred by the immunity of the United
States, as a foreign sovereign, from suit without its consent and by the
immunity of the officials of the United States armed forces for acts committed
in the performance of their official functions pursuant to the grant to the
United States armed forces of rights, power and authority within the bases
under the Military Bases Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is further contended that the rule allowing suits against public officers and
employees for unauthorized acts, torts and criminal acts is a rule of domestic
law, not of international law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
applies to cases involving the relations between private suitors and their
government or state, not the relations between one government and another from
which springs the doctrine of immunity of a foreign sovereign.</p>

<p class="BODY">I. The rule that a state may not be sued without its consent, now
expressed in Article XVI, Section 3, of the 1987 Constitution, is one of the
generally accepted principles of international law that we have adopted as part
of the law of our land under Article II, Section 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter provision merely reiterates a
policy earlier embodied in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions and also intended to
manifest our resolve to abide by the rules of the international community.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While the doctrine appears to prohibit only suits against the
state without its consent, it is also applicable to complaints filed against
officials of the state for acts allegedly performed by them in the discharge of
their duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is that if the
judgment against such officials will require the state itself to perform an
affirmative act to satisfy the same, such as the appropriation of the amount
needed to pay the damages awarded against them, the suit must be regarded as
against the state itself although it has not been formally <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
It must be noted, however, that the rule is not so all-encompassing as to be
applicable under all circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a different matter where the public official is made to
account in his capacity as such for acts contrary to law and injurious to the
rights of plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was clearly set
forth by Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> in <u>Director of the
Bureau of Telecommunications, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Aligaen</span>,

"Inasmuch as the State authorizes only legal acts by its officers,
unauthorized acts of government officials or officers are not acts of the
State, and an action against the officials or officers by one whose rights have
been invaded or violated by such acts, for the protection of his rights, is not
a suit against the State within the rule of immunity of the State from
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same tenor, it has been
said that an action at law or suit in equity against a State officer or the
director of a State department on the ground that, while claiming to act for
the State, he violates or invades the personal and property rights of the
plaintiff, under an unconstitutional act or under an assumption of authority
which he does not have, is not a suit against the State within the
constitutional provision that the State may not be sued without its
consent."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The rationale for this ruling is that the doctrine of state immunity cannot be

appropriately be invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no
application, however, where the suit against such a functionary had to be
instituted because of his failure to comply with the duty imposed by statute

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> authorities are clear on
the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They state that the doctrine
of immunity from suit will not apply and may not be invoked where the public
official is being sued in his private and personal capacity as an ordinary citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cloak of protection afforded the officers
and agents of the government is removed the moment they are sued in their
individual capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This situation
usually arises where the public official acts without authority or in excess of
the powers vested in him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
well-settled principle of law that a public official may be liable in his
personal private capacity for whatever damage he may have caused by his act
done with malice and in bad faith, or beyond the scope of his authority or

guilty of discriminating against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> on account of her sex, color and origin, categorically
emphasized that:</p>

<blockquote>There is ample evidence to sustain plaintiffs' complaint that
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
was refused appointment as Guidance<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span>Counselor
by the defendants on account of her sex, color and origin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>She is a female, brown in color and a Filipino by origin, although
married to an American who is a member of the United States Air Force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is qualified for the vacant position of
Guidance Counselor in the office of the education director at Clark Air Base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She received a Master of Arts Degree from the
University of Santo Tomas, Manila, in 1971 and has completed 34 semester hours

science.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has also completed all
course work in human behavior and <span class="SpellE">counselling</span>
psychology for a doctoral degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is
a civil service eligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
important, she had functioned as a Guidance Counselor at the Clark Air Base at
the GS-1710-9 level for approximately four years at the time she applied for
the same position in 1976.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In filling the vacant position of Guidance Counselor, defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> did not even consider the application of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>, but referred the
vacancy to CORRO which appointed Edward B. Isakson who was not eligible to the position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In defending his act, defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>
gave as his excuse that there was a question in his mind regarding the validity
of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf's</span>
work experience because of lack of record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But his assertion is belied by the fact that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> had previously
been employed as Guidance Counselor at the Clark Air Base in 1971 and this
would have come out if defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> had taken the
trouble of interviewing her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can
defendant free himself from any blame for the non-appointment of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> by claiming that
it was CORRO that appointed Edward B. Isakson.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This would not have happened if defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>
adhered to the regulation that limits the appointment to the position of
Guidance Counselor, GS-1710-9 to qualified dependents of military personnel of
the Department of Defense who are locally available like the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not have referred the matter to
CORRO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span> should have protested the appointment of Edward B.
Isakson who was ineligible for the position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He, however, remained silent because he was satisfied with the
appointment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Likewise, the acts of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>
in rejecting the appointment of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> were undoubtedly discriminatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
twice applied for the position of Guidance Counselor sometime in 1975 and in
October 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although she was qualified
for the position, her appointment was rejected by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
who were appointed, a certain <span class="SpellE">Petrucci</span> and Edward B.
Isakson, were ordered removed by the U.S. Civil Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of replacing <span class="SpellE">Petrucci</span>
with the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>,
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span> had the position vacated by <span class="SpellE">Petrucci</span> abolished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in the case of Edward Isakson, the defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>
ignored the order of the U.S. Civil Service Commission to have him removed
according to the testimony of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In connection with her complaint against the defendants, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> was presented a
Notice of Proposed Disposition of her Discrimination Complaint by Col. Charles
J. Corey, Vice Commander, Third Combat Support Group, Clark Air Base, which
would entitle her to a temporary appointment as Guidance Counselor with the
implied assurance that she would be appointed in a permanent capacity in the
event of a vacancy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the time of the issuance of said Notice, defendants knew that
there would be a vacancy in a permanent position as Guidance Counselor occupied
by Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> and it was understood between
Col. Corey and plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
that this position would be reserved for her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Knowing this arrangement, defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>
rejected the request for extension of services of Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, after plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span>
Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> consented to the terms of the Notice of
Proposed Disposition of her Discrimination Complaint, defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span> extended the services of Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> indefinitely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This act barred plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> from applying for the position of Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To rebut the evidence of the plaintiffs,
defendants cited the findings and conclusions of Mr. Rudolph Duncan, who was
appointed to investigate plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf's</span> complaint for discrimination and Col. Charles J.
Corey, Vice Commander, Third Combat Support Group that defendants were not
guilty of discrimination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is pointed out, however, that Mr. Rudolph Duncan found plaintiff
<span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> to be highly
qualified for the position of Guidance Counselor at the GS-1710-9 level and that
management should have hired a local applicant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Col. Corey characterized the act of defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>
as sloppy and recommended that he be reprimanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event their findings and conclusions
are not binding with this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To blunt the accusation of discrimination against them, defendants
maintained that the extension of the appointment of Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> was a joint decision of management and Central
Civilian Personnel Office, Clark Air Base.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, having earlier rejected by himself the request for
extension of the services of Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span>,
defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span> should not have concurred to such
an extension as the reversal of his stand gave added substance to the charge of
discrimination against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To further disprove the charge that the defendants discriminated
against plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>
for her non-appointment as Guidance Counselor on account of her being a
Filipino and a female, counsel for the defendants cited the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span>
whose appointment was extended by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>
is likewise a female and a Filipino by origin; (2) that there are Filipinos
employed in the office of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>; and
(3) that there were two other women who applied in 1976 with the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> for the position
of Guidance Counselor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The contention of the defendants based on the allegations
enumerated in Nos. 1 and 2 of the preceding paragraph is without merit as there
is no evidence to show that Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> and
the Filipinos in the office of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>
were appointed by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, faced with a choice between plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span>
Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> or Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span>,
it was to be expected that defendant <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span> chose
to retain Mrs. Mary <span class="SpellE">Abalateo</span> as Guidance Counselor in
retaliation for the complaint of discrimination filed against him by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, as to the contention based on the
allegation in No. 3 of the preceding paragraph that there were two other women
applicants in 1976 with plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>, the record reveals that they had minimum
qualifications unlike plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> who was highly qualified.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

that private respondents did, in fact, discriminate against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it deemed such acts insufficient to
prevent an application of the doctrine of state immunity, contrary to the
findings made by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
reasons out that “[t]he parties involved are all American citizens (although
plaintiff is a Filipina by origin) and the appointment of personnel inside the

in Handbook X-118, are completion of all academic requirements for a bachelor's
degree from an accredited college or university and successful completion of a
teacher education program under an "approved program" or successful
completion of required kinds of courses.</blockquote>

we find that Mr. Isakson has a bachelor's degree but he does not show
completion of a teacher education program.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To qualify for Guidance Counselor on the basis of coursework and
semester hour credit, he would need to have 24 semester hours in Education and
12 semester hours in a combination of Psychology and Guidance subjects directly
related to education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find
that he meets these requirements.</blockquote>

complaints teaches me that, if the Civil Service Commission finds that <span class="SpellE">nonselection</span> resulted from any kind of management

<p class="BODY">The initial burden is on the plaintiff to establish a <u>prima</u>

Any such justification is wanting in the case at bar, despite the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
case for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents' defense is based purely
on outright denials which are insufficient to discharge the <u>onus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>probandi</u></span> imposed upon them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They equally rely on the assertion that they
are immune from suit by reason of their official functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly pointed out by petitioners in
their Memorandum, the mere invocation by private respondents of the official
character of their duties cannot shield them from liability especially when the

dismissed on their mere assertion that their acts are imputable to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

<p class="BODY">III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article XIII, Section
3, of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State shall afford full
protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote
full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a carry-over from Article II, Section

<p class="BODY">Under the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the assurance of equality in
employment and work opportunities regardless of sex, race, or creed is also
given by the equal protection clause of the Bill of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 14th Amendment, in declaring that no
state shall deprive a person of his life, liberty, or property without due
process of law or deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws, undoubtedly intended not only that there should be no
arbitrary spoliation of property, but that equal protection and security should
be given to all under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their personal and
civil rights, and that all persons should be equally entitled to pursue their
happiness and acquire and enjoy property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It extends its protection to all persons without regard to race, color,

<p class="BODY">The words "life, liberty, and property" as used in

which a member of the body politic is entitled under the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These terms include the right of
self-defense, freedom of speech, religious and political freedom, exemption
from arbitrary arrests, the right to freely buy and sell as others may, the
right to labor, to contract, to terminate contracts, to acquire property, and
the right to all our liberties, personal, civil and political -- in short, all

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that private respondents <span class="SpellE">Persi</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Detwiler</span>, in committing the acts complained of
have, in effect, violated the basic constitutional right of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> to earn a living
which is very much an integral aspect of the right to life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this, they should be held accountable.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we recognize petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf's</span> entitlement to an award of moral damages, we
however find no justification for the award of actual or compensatory damages,
based on her supposedly unearned income from March, 1975 up to April, 1978 in
the total amount of $39,662.49, as erroneously granted by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidence that the plaintiff could have bettered her position had
it not been for the defendants' wrongful act cannot serve as basis for an award
of damages, because it is highly speculative.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf's</span>
claim is merely premised on the possibility that had she been employed, she
would have earned said amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the
undeniable fact remains that she was never so employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner never acquired any vested right to
the salaries pertaining to the position of GS 1710-9 to which she was never
appointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Damages which are merely possible
are speculative.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
In determining actual damages, the court cannot rely on speculation, conjecture
or guesswork.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without the actual proof
of loss, the award of actual damages is erroneous.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the award of actual damages made by the trial court should be
deleted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attorney's fees, however, may
be granted and we believe that an award thereof in the sum of P20,000.00 is
reasonable under the circumstances.</p>

private respondents postulate that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span>

the United States federal legislation on equality of opportunity for civilian
employees, which is allegedly exclusive of any other remedy under American law,

<p class="BODY">As earlier noted, in a Supplement to Partial Stipulation of Facts

the Secretary of the Air Force in the discrimination case filed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Shauf</span>, No. SF

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is basic that remedial statutes are to be
construed liberally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term "may,"

<span class="SpellE">Shauf</span> is not limited to these remedies, but is
entitled as a matter of plain and simple justice to choose that remedy, not
otherwise proscribed, which will best advance and protect her interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, thus, nothing to enjoin her from
seeking redress in Philippine courts which should not be ousted of jurisdiction
