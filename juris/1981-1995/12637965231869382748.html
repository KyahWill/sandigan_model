cousin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assets of Weldon
Construction were transferred to, and its liabilities assumed by the new

<p class="BODY">Prior to <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Lee drafted plans for a theater-apartment

difference between the two agreements lies in the proposed consideration for
the administration or supervision services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Proposed under Exhibit "A" was Ten Per Cent (10%) of the total
cost of construction (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span> "A", par. 5)
without a maximum amount set as a limit on that cost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, Exhibit "5" sets the
stipulated price of the construction of the building at P600<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
Pesos, which is the consideration of the contract (Exhibit "5." par.
4).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other point of divergence is the
manner in which the expenses for labor and materials are provided for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "A" sets up a revolving
fund of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> Pesos to be paid by the Owner and
to be replenished by him from time to time, which fund shall answer for the
various costs of construction including labor and materials (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"A" par. 1).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No such fund is provided for in Exhibit
"5" since the Contractor Weldon Construction binds itself to supply
the labor and materials (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"5",
par. 2).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The first proposal
submitted by Weldon Construction for rendering service under a contract of

submitted by Weldon Construction subsequently.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

stipulated price, the same was closely followed by the "Building
Contract" (Exhibit "5") signed by Lee, setting forth in detail
the proposed terms and stipulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the petitioner claims that the contract was never returned to
its predecessors-in-interest, it appears upon the face of the </span>document

Lee, appearing on the document (Exhibit "5").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lee himself has admitted said signature as
his.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, however, impugns the
binding effect of the Building Contract (Exhibit "5") by assailing
its due execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It calls the attention

the conclusion of the trial court that the signature of the defendant (herein

the due execution of a contract, i.e. the date of signing by one of the

<blockquote>It will be noted that whereas under the old article recovery for
additional costs in a construction contract can be had if authorization to make
such additions can be proved, the amendment evidently requires that instead of
merely proving authorization, such authorization must be made in writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evident purpose of the amendment is to
prevent litigation for additional costs incurred by reason of additions or
changes in the original plans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is this
additional requirement of a written authorization, to be considered as a mere
extension of the Statute of Frauds, or is it a substantive provision?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the requirement for a written
authorization is not merely to prohibit admission or oral testimony against the
objection of the adverse party, can be inferred from the fact that the provision
is not included among those specified in the Statute of Frauds, Article 1403 of
the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it does not appear to
have been intended as an extension of the Statute of Frauds, it must have been
adopted as a substantive provision or a condition precedent to recovery.</blockquote>
