Act No. 6031, there was nothing to program and to allot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The current appropriations decree, PD No.

adjustment of terminal leaves, retirement gratuities and salary differentials
of municipal judges for the period from August 4, 1969 to May 31, 1971.</blockquote>

the government to have their retirement gratuities based on the higher salaries
authorized under laws enacted while they were still in the service but
implemented only after their retirement from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inevitable after-effect will be bigger
appropriation which the government will have to provide, but which it cannot

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On April 3, 1979,
petitioner sent a letter to the late Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro stating
among others that "according to Section 2 of Republic Act No. 5095 under
which we retired, these benefits can be paid from any fund in the National
Treasury not otherwise appropriated" (p. 10, rec.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid letter was endorsed to the
Minister </span>of the Budget on April 21, 1979, which was allegedly not
answered (p. 11, rec.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in the
comment filed by the Solicitor General, it was stated that herein petitioner
sent a second letter to the President on July 5, 1979 reiterating his claim for
the increase of his monthly pension from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">P550.00

del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and who has to make do with his meager
monthly pension of P550.00 in this time of economic hardship, nonetheless, WE
hold that payment to him of whatever increase in his monthly annuity, terminal
leave and other retirement gratuity benefits brought about by the enactment of
Republic Act No. 6031 increasing the salary rates of municipal judges, must
yield to the overriding economic consideration of availability of funds which
the government must set aside for the purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Commissioner of the Budget in his 2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>

actually appropriate the funds to cover adjustment of terminal leaves,
retirement gratuities and salary differentials of municipal judges for the
period from August 4, 1969 to May 31, 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 6 of said Act No. 6031 merely "authorized to be

appropriation, herein petitioner cannot compel the Minister of the Budget to
release sufficient amount for the payment of the increase in the monthly
annuity of petitioner herein pursuant to Republic Act No. 6031 because
"such allocation entails the exercise of judgment and discretion which
cannot be controlled by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mandamus</i>"
