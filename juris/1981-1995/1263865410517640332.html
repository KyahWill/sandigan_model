medical evidence compatible with sexual intercourse with a man on or about the
alleged date of commission October 22, 1971 (Exhibit "B-1") (March 8,

LCO, Metrocom, <span style="">testified that he
arrested appellant Giron </span><span style="">in</span><span style=""> Navotas while driving a </span><span style="">P</span><span style="">UJ
jeep, after which he </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">urned the latter over to the warrant section of
the Caloocan City Police Department (August 1, 1974, TSN, pp. 2-10).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Corazon</span></u><span style=""> <u>Gungun</u> testified that at the time of
the incident she was a pre-med student at the University of the East in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> (September 13, TSN, 1974, p. 39).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came to know appellant Giron about a year
prior to the incident since he was then working as a driver </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Lachenal family whose residence was opposite their store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was courting her but she did not accept
his love (September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 46-51).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On October 22, 1971 on coming out of the San Bartolome Church in Malabon
af</span><span style="">ter </span><span style="">hearing mass, she saw appellant Giron who
informed her that it would be the last </span>time <span style="">that he will approach her since he was going to Bataan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He forced her to stay and talk to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invited her to eat and so as</span><span style=""> </span>not <span style="">to create a scandal,</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">since he was pulling her and people were
staring at them, she went with him to Jack's Restaurant in Monumento where he
continued professing his love for her (September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 4-14).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was getting late and
appellant Giron was preventing her from going home, threatening her that he had
other companions and a vehicle outside and that he would create a scandal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She, however, forced herself to stand and
proceeded towards the jeepney stop to get a ride home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was surprised that he was at her <span class="GramE">back</span> and pulled her to a waiting taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pleaded with him to let her <span class="GramE">go,</span> shouting at </span>the top <span style="">of her voice but the people around merely stared at them (September </span>13,
<span style="">1974, TSN, pp. 16-22).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The taxi driver appeared
hesitant to proceed but moved when appellant Giron told him that she is his
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded directly to the
Fifth Avenue </span><span style="">Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">While
inside the taxi, she shouted, pleaded and even scratched his face (September
13, 1974, TSN, pp. 24-25).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the hotel, appellant Giron pulled her out of the
taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No hotel boy attended to them or
if there were any, she could not remember (January 17, 1975, TSN, p. 33).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was continuously struggling, kicking him,
<span class="GramE">pulling</span> his clothes to the point that his pants got <span style="">t</span>orn to prevent him from bringing her
to the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside, appellant G<span style="">i</span>ron pushed her towards the bed and
locked the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stood up and tried <span style="">to open the door but was again pushed by the </span>appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened several times, according to the
complainant more than ten times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
process of her struggle, she noticed that her dress, a one piece dress with a
zipper at the back, was open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried
to cover her private part with her two hands (across the chest) and turned her
back against the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
was <span style="">able </span>to<span style=""> </span>take off her clothes, including her
underwears, and lay on top of <span style="">her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took appellant sometime to consummate his
act </span>as she was continuously struggling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she eventually lost her strength, she felt a pain that she has
never felt before and it was then that she concluded that the appellant has
succeeded in ravishing her (September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 26-40).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">They left the hotel the
following morning on board a taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
alighted at the corner of San Ildefonso Church in Navotas and took a jeepney
towards Daanghari </span>to get home (January 17, 1975, TSN, pp. 49-50).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon reaching their
house, she informed her mother </span>that she was abducted by appellant
Giron.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on <st1:date year="1971" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1971</st1:date> that she was examined
by a <span style="">doctor because she lost
consciousness for more than </span><span style="">one</span>
week and could not speak (September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 41-43).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On cross examination,
when she was confronted with a picture (Exhibit "1") showing her with
appellant Giron, she claimed that it was a stolen shot taken at</span> the
Chinese Garden in Luneta when the latter went with <span style="">their family on </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">outing (September </span>13, <span style="">1974, pp. TSN, 52-58).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was shown a letter addressed to
appellant Giron (Exhibit "2"), she identified the body of the letter
to be in her handwriting but denied </span>having written the greetings
"Mahal <span class="GramE">kong</span> Melvin" (September 13, 1974,
TSN, pp. 50-60).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She likewise denied
being the signatory of the letter but claimed that it was intended for her
boyfriend, a certain <span style="">Felizardo Alejandrino
(September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 63-</span>67).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When confronted with an envelop with the letterhead of the University of
the East (Exhibit "3") <span style="">she
admitted that it was in her handwriting but claimed that it contained an
estamfita (Exhibit "6") which she sent to the appellant </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">moral support when he entered the cursillo (September 13, 1974, TSN,
pp. 76-78).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Christmas card was
presented (Exhibit "4") </span>and admitted by the complainant to be
in her <span style="">handwriting but denied having
given it to the appellant since it was placed on the Christmas tree in their
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claimed that it was taken by
the appellant from the Christmas tree (September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 60-70).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Venancio</span></u><span style=""> <u>Luna</u> testified that he came to know
the complainant Corazon Gungun about </span><span style="">two </span><span style="">months prior to the
incident of </span><st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="10"><span style="">October </span><span style="">22, </span><span style="">1971</span></st1:date><span style=""> because he and appellant Giron often went to

eloped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After sometime, he brought them
to the house of his sister, Feliza Luna, at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Pacheco St.</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">, Tondo because they were ashamed since the
complainant knew </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">lot of people in his place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, appellant Giron and
complainant Gungun came back to his house and asked him to bring them </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the house of complainant's parents, to which he agreed (August 1, 1985,
TSN, pp. 7-17).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was the mother of the
complainant who led them into the house when they came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She scolded the complainant and the
appellant, and even slapped the former so he asked permission to leave (August
1, 1975, TSN, pp. 33-36).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant Giron testified
that he started courting the complainant about a year prior to the incident and
that she reciprocated his love sometime in September 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the day of the incident, at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="15"><span style="">3:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="">, he informed the complainant that he was
leaving for </span><st1:place><span style="">Bataan</span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
suggested that they hear mass together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After hearing mass at the San Bartolome Church, they went to Jack's
Restaurant for merienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After which,
they went to Nayong Pilipino, then to Luneta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were supposed to spend the night at the place of his friend named
Mely but had to proceed to the Fifth Avenue HoteI when they were not
accommodated at the latter's house (September 26, 1975, TSN, pp. 28-42).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon their arrival at the
hotel, he paid for the room accommodation but they were not required to </span>register
(February 13, 1976, TSN, pp. 34-35).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They <span style="">spent the night there, upon
mutual agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made love twice,
the first lasting for one hour and the second for thirty minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these are with the consent of the complainant
(September 26, 1975, TSN, </span>pp. <span style="">47-51).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

they spent </span>the rest of the day and the night (September 26, 1975, TSN,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">They went back to
Venancio Luna the following day and asked him to accompany them to the house of
complainant Gungun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their arrival
at the latter's house, the mother of Corazon scolded them and even boxed
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked why they eloped, he

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense assigned three

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES
SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE WHICH BRING FORTH GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO THE VERACITY AND

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED
INSPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION IS UTTERLY
INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN A CONVICTION BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF
THE CRIME OF RAPE <span style="">DESPITE THE </span>FACT
THAT GREAT WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE OR THE SUM TOTAL OF IT SHOWS THAT THE SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE ACCUSED AND THE COMPLAINANT WAS MUTUAL AND VOLUNTARY.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reduced to bare essentials, the issue in the case at bar is
whether or not the guilt of the accused-appellant was proven beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well established that the appellate court generally does
not disturb the findings of the lower court considering that the latter is in a
better position to pass upon the matter of credibility having seen and heard
the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, exception
is taken to <span style="">this </span>well-settled
rule in order <span style="">to </span>keep fa<span style="">ith </span>with the immutable principle that
every <span style="">criminal </span>conviction must be
supported by proof beyond reasonable doubt (People v. <span style="">Mejias, </span>168 SCRA 33, November 28, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">Among others, the exceptions to the general rule are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the conclusion <span style="">is </span>a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises <span style="">and </span>conjectures; (b) the inference made
is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (c) there is grave abuse of
discretion; (d) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and (e) <span style="">the </span>court in making its f<span style="">indings, </span>went beyond the issues of the
case and the same are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and
appellee (People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 58 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">While rape is truly a <span style="">detestable
</span>crime, the probability looms <span style="">la</span>rge
that it may be resorted to as a contrivance to malign the accused who would be
hard pressed to prove his innocence and would thereby place his life, liberty
or fortune or all of them together, hanging on the balance (People v. Ymana,
171 SCRA 174, March 9, 1989 reiterating the ruling <span style="">in People v. </span>Barbo, 56 SCRA 459, March 19, 1974 and People v.
Quintal, 125 SCRA 734, November 25, 1983).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, appellant is a married man, a fact known to the
complainant (September 13, 1974, TSN, p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">For<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">the</span></span><span style=""> testimony of the offended party to be </span>sufficient to convict for
the crime of rape, it must be <span style="">clear and
free from any serious contradiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
story must be impeccable and must ring true throughout </span><span style="">or </span>bear the stamp of absolute truth and
candor (People v. Ramos, 167 SCRA 476, November 18, 1988; People v. Ymana, <u>supra</u>;
People v. Lacuna, 87 SCRA 364, 1974).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This the</span> complainant has failed to meet.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainant's testimony
is vitiated with a lot of inconsistencies and improbabilities that do not
inspire </span>belief.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainant Gungun
testified that she was shouting </span>on top <span style="">of </span>her voice when she was being forced inside the taxi and also
when she was being dragged to the <span style="">room
in the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet no one came to help
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily it is inconceivable that
with the resulting fiasco, no one noticed or even seemed interested </span>(September
13, 1974, TSN, pp. 20-30).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably, the
accused was not even holding a gun or a deadly weapon so that anybody who
wanted <span class="GramE">to,</span> could have helped without endangering
themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even more incredible is
the testimony </span>of <span style="">complainant
that </span><span style="">she </span><span style="">had been fighting the accused all </span>the
way from the taxi to the hotel room (September <span style="">13, 1974, TSN, pp. 20-30) which under normal circumstances could have
knocked off her eyeglasses to the floor </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the taxi and yet she
claimed that after the sexual intercourse the accused handed back to her, her
eyeglasses and clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left the
hotel together, riding a taxi </span><span style="">and
</span><span style="">then she, who could hardly walk,
upon alighting at the San Ildefonso Church, took a jitney and went home alone

<p class="BODY"><span style="">She narrated that her
dress - a one piece dress with zipper at the back was open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she tried </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">cover her private parts with her hands </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">turned her back at
the accused; all the more exposing her body to him and facilitating the removal
of her dress (September 13, 1974, TSN, pp.</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">26-40).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Also from her testimony,
she would have this Court believe that she </span><span style="">only </span><span style="">knew the accused
because the latter was courting her, but she did not accept his love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact she was aloof and it was only her
mother who was treating him well (September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 51-54).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, her testimony was belied by the
letters, cards, etc.<span class="GramE">,</span> she sent the accused, the most

(September 13, 1974, TSN, pp. 56-57).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She claimed that such was a </span>stolen shot which obviously made it
even more <span style="">convincing (September 13,
1974, TSN, p. 55).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is beyond belief that after complainant told her
mother that she was abducted and raped<span style=""> </span>and
thereafter lapsed into unconsciousness for <span style="">one week, the latter was not even alarmed to seek immediate medical
assistance but waited instead for complainant to regain consciousness before
having her </span>physically examined, in order to file the case (September 13,
1974, TSN, pp. 41-42).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, in view of the
severity of the penalties for the offense of rape, the judiciary is cautioned
by this Court to take extreme care to avoid an injustice to the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If reasonable doubt exists, the verdict must
be one of acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape is an
accusation easy to make, hard to prove but harder to defend by the accused,
though innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence for the
prosecution must be clear and convincing to overcome the constitutional
presumption of innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape is an
offense to which, as is often the case, </span><span style="">only </span><span style="">two people can
testify, thus requiring the most conscientious effort on the part of the
arbiter to</span> weigh and appraise the conflicting testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a <span style="">reasonable
doubt exists, the verdict must be one of </span>acquittal (People v. Leoparte,
