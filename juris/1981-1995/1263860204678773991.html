<p class="BODY">Antonio <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span> testified regarding the
death of <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordanza</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1978</st1:date>, while lying down in his house, he
heard a gunshot, succeeded by consecutive ones coming from the drier of <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lobusta</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 40, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,

window, he heard <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordanza</span>
calling him for help and rushing to his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Ibid) When asked about the <span class="SpellE">gunburst</span>, <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> said he saw two (2) persons who fired at him and
he shot one of them in return.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 41,
Ibid; p.57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
went to look for Rogelio and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> in their
respective houses to find out the "true man" who, according to him,
was from <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lubrosman</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 42, 44, Ibid) Meanwhile, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lobusta</span> where <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> and Rogelio
were but he answered that he did not know.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lobusta</span>
also made efforts to look for the two but to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After going to and returning from <span class="SpellE">Elpidio's</span> and Rogelio's houses three times or for fifteen
minutes, and before setting off on his last attempt to verify, <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordanza</span> removed his
clothes except his short pants so that he will not be recognized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 45, Ibid) Antonio himself tried to look
for the two <span class="SpellE">Baysas</span> but along the way, he saw a dead
person, whom he identified as <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baysa</span>, being cradled by his wife near a canal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 46, Ibid) About ten (10) meters away from
the dead body stood appellants Domingo and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Baysa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lobusta</span>, Marcos
Valdez and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baysa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid) He noticed that Rogelio was holding a <span class="GramE">carbine<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(</span>p. 47, Ibid)
He also saw <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordanza</span>
running and heard him calling Rogelio: "Gel, Gel!" (Ibid) As <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordanza</span> came nearer to
where the appellants were, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span> heard
Domingo say: "Gel, Gel! <span class="SpellE">Patayin</span> mo <span class="SpellE">na</span>!<span class="GramE">",</span> meaning "Gel, Gel!
Kill him!" (p. 48, Ibid) to which order Rogelio retorted: "<span class="SpellE">Huwag</span>, <span class="SpellE">kami</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">na</span></span> <span class="SpellE">lang</span>", meaning,
"Not anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We will do it by
ourselves." (Ibid, p. 59, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordanza</span> and appellant
Rogelio left the crowd walking side by side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As they passed near Antonio <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>, Rogelio
ordered <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> to walk ahead and aimed the carbine
at the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they were sixty
meters away from Antonio <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>, one <span class="SpellE">gunburst</span> was heard after which Rogelio returned to the

<p class="BODY">Antonio <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span> also revealed that there
