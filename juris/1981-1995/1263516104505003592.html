				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Amidst the pervasive and escalating traffic of illegal drugs, the decision of the court a quo in Criminal Case No. 2188-D which principally adjudged the culpability of Roland L. Melosantos for the illicit sale of one kilogram of "shabu", and imposed the penalty of life imprisonment (p. 240, Record) could have received the approbation of a public already exasperated with the seemingly endless social malady.&nbsp; But not for Roland L. Melosantos who continues to profess his innocence in the appeal now before us.<br><br>The theory of the People is to the effect that accused-appellant's apprehension was preceded by a buy-bust operation on October 10, 1992 during which occasion, accused-appellant was caught in the process of transacting the sale of 1 kilogram of "shabu" with the arresting team.&nbsp; To buttress this general proposition, SPO1 Jeremias Manlatao of the Narcotics Command was offered as the first witness of the prosecution.&nbsp; His essential testimony is to the effect that he was the poseur-buyer; that he was at the Shell Gas Station infront of Unimart, Greenhills around 9:30 o'clock in the morning together with Supt. Elenzano, SPO4 Velasco, including the confidential informer, waiting for accused-appellant who had previously agreed, through the confidential informer, to sell 1 kilogram of shabu at P450.00 per gram; that when accused-appellant arrived on the designated time and place on board a red Mitsubishi Lancer, he disembarked from the car and asked for the payment to which request the witness acceded (tsn, Nov. 25, 1992, pp. 4, 7, 8, &amp; 11).<br><br>In the course of his open court statements, SPO1 Manlatao affirmed his signature appearing on the Joint Affidavit of Arrest which reads:<br><br><i>We, the undersigned, members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) presently assigned with the Special Operations Division, PNP Narcotics Command (NARCOM) stationed at Camp Crame, Quezon City, after having been duly sworn to in accordance with law, hereby depose and say;</i><br><br><i>That in the morning of October 10, 1992, Superintendent CESAR D. ELENZANO PNP designated SPO1 Jeremias Manlatao PNP to pose as buyer of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride and furnished him five hundred peso bills sandwiching each bundle, with serial numbers H597244, BU879337, BM612211, BQ568403, ASO61621, AR830122, BJ523199 and BT993216, to represent the amount of four hundred fifty thousand pesos, to be used in a buy-bust operation against the source of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride of arrested suspect VIRGILIO "TENG" CARLOS identified as alias ROLAND;</i><br><br><i>That, Virgilio Carlos who voluntarily agreed to cooperate and expecting nothing in return, contacted alias ROLAND then indorsed SPO1 Manlatao as a big-time buyer of Methamphetamine Hcl. SPO1 Manlatao then ordered for a kilo of said regulated drug at alias ROLAND's price of four hundred fifty pesos per gram and alias ROLAND agreed to sell and suggested that they meet at around 9:30 in the morning of same date at the Shell Gas Station infront the Unimart Shopping Center, Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila to consummate the seal;</i><br><br><i>That, it was about 9:30 A.M of same date, when alias ROLAND arrived on board a red Lancer car with license plate number PGZ 138 and approached SPO1 Manlatao and Virgilio Carlos asking to see the payment for the one kilo of Methamphetamine Hcl ordered for and SPO1 Manlatao obligingly showed it.&nbsp; Alias ROLAND then motioned them to follow him to his car and opened its trunk where he opened a cartoon box containing transparent plastic bags with contents of what he claimed to be the one kilo of Methamphetamine Hcl ordered for and handed it over to SPO1 Manlatao demanding for its payment.&nbsp; It was then that SPO1 Manlatao gave the pre-arranged signal to the rest of the undersigned back-up who rushed to the scene identifying themselves and SPO1 Manlatao as NARCOM Agents and arrested alias ROLAND who was apprised of the nature of his arrest and his Constitutional Rights and was identified as ROLAND MELOSANTOS y LAPENA, 36 years old, married, native of Quezon City, businessman and resident of Nr. 6 Catleya Street, Mindanao Avenue, Project 6, Quezon City;</i><br><br><i>That, upon arrest, ROLAND MELOSANTOS immediately declared that he is just a courier ordered by Michael Ty to deliver and sell the said stuff (Shabu) to any prospective buyer and was told to sell said shabu at four hundred pesos per gram so that the stuff could easily be converted into cash as Michael Ty needs the money very badly;</i> <br><br><i>That, suspect Roland Melosantos even surrendered his Easy pager unit to the undersigned to show the messages sent to him by Michael Ty and to prove to us that indeed he was just ordered to sell the shabu by Michael Ty;</i> <br><br><i>That, arrested suspect with seized evidence were brought to Special Operations Division, PNP Narcotics Command at Camp Crame, Quezon City for investigation and proper disposition;</i><br><br><blockquote><i>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we hereunto signed this Joint Affidavit of Arrest/Poseur Buyer this 10th day of October 1992, here at Camp Crame, Quezon City;</i><br><br><i>AFFIANTS FURTHER SAY NONE.</i><br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><i>(Sgd) </i></div></td> <td width="50%"> <div align="CENTER">(Sgd) </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="CENTER"><i>SPO1 Jeremias Manlatao PNP SPO1 </i></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Osmundo G.

Ty supposedly asked permission to use the residence telephone from Melosantos.&nbsp; After Ty was granted permission, accused-appellant allegedly noticed that Ty gave the residence phone number of accused-appellant's parents-in-law to the person with whom Ty was conversing over the phone. Thereafter, accused-appellant continued to narrate, when he and Ty returned to the house after a 15-minute test drive of the car within Park Way Village, the phone rung, that he answered, but the call was for Ty who then talked twice with the caller (tsn, March 16, 1993, pp. 3-15).&nbsp; When Ty and accused-appellant agreed on the purchase price of the car, another test drive was conducted along EDSA, with accused-appellant on the wheel and Ty, whom accused-appellant noticed to be carrying a plastic bag, on the passenger side (ibid., p. 17).&nbsp; Accused-appellant further claimed that he was instructed by Ty to proceed towards Greenhills and to stop at the Shell Gas Station at the corner of Ortigas Avenue and Wilson St. where Ty was supposed to pick up the money for the purchase price of accused-appellant's car (ibid., pp. 18-19); and that while waiting at the station, a group of armed men arrived, searched accused-appellant's car which yielded the shabu in Ty's plastic bag (<span style="font-style: italic;">ibid</span>., pp. 20-26).<br><br>In decreeing the criminal accountability of accused-appellant, the trial judge made the initial observation that the absence of ill-motive on the part of prosecution witnesses to fabricate the buy-bust operation, as well as the presumption under adjective law towards the regularity in the performance of the law enforcers' duty are sufficient factors to incline one to a judgment of conviction (p. 9, Decision; p. 220, Record).&nbsp; And in response to the serious contradictions allegedly committed by the People's witnesses, the magistrate below explained that he saw no irreconcilable differences on material points, and that rather, the divergence of perception on certain details typifies truthfulness, apart from the undeniable circumstance that the suspect was caught <span style="font-style: italic;">in flagrante</span> (pp. 20-27, Decision; pp. 231-238, Record).<br><br>Hence, the appeal at bench interposed by Melosantos wherein it is argued that the trial court erred in -<br><br><i>I.&nbsp; ... not considering the glaring lies, serious inconsistencies and substantial contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution&nbsp; witnesses in the manner and conduct of the alleged "buy-bust operation" that should have invalidated their testimonies and entitled the accused to an acquittal.</i><br><br><i>II.&nbsp; ... not ruling that the failure of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">known </span>confidential informant to take the witness stand is fatal to the cause of the prosecution.</i> <br><br><i>III. ... ruling that the identity of the confiscated items was assured by Julita de Villa, the forensic chemist.</i> <br><br><i>IV ... not finding that that the NARCOM, using their captive "informant" induced, lured and instigated the accused to commit a&nbsp; "crime".</i> <br><br><i>V. ... convicting the accused applying the statutory presumption that law enforcers are presumed to have regularly performed their duty.</i><br><br>At this juncture, it is significant to recall to mind the proposition of the principal witnesses of the prosecution in their joint affidavit of arrest (pp. 101-102, Record) to the effect that the buy-bust operation was concocted on account of the implicit confession from an arrested suspect in the person of Virgilio "TENG" Carlos that herein accused-appellant was the source of the drugs. It is also interesting to note that the so-called arrested person who pointed the accusing finger at Melosantos was never presented as a witness for the People.&nbsp; Given these considerations, we cannot help observing that the incriminating statement in the joint affidavit of arrest against Melosantos linking him to the pernicious activity must be disregarded, nay, struck down inasmuch as the import thereof is hearsay in character.&nbsp; The second-hand information of Carlos implicating Melosantos as the brains of the illegal peddling narrated to, and conveyed by SPO1 Manlatao before the court a quo must similarly be jettisoned as a breach of the hearsay rule.&nbsp; In response to the magistrate's questions along this line, SPO1 Manlatao said:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2"><i>Court -</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><i>And now you came to know the source of this shabu from Virgilio "Teng" Carlos?</i></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><i>A -</i></td> <td> Yes, sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><i>Court - So you came to know from Virgilio "Teng" Carlos the source of the shabu?</i></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><i>A - </i></td> <td>Yes, sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><i>Court -</i></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><i> Through whom is the source?</i></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="font-style: italic;">A -</td> <td style="font-style: italic;"> What he said was from Roland Melosantos, sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><i>Court -</i></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><i> Next question, counsel.</i></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><i>Atty.

Ed., p. 486).&nbsp; By virtue of this legal aphorism, no probative value can attach to the alleged confession of Carlos albeit no objection thereto was interposed by the defense (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Villahermosa,</span> (CA) 67 O.G. 4920 citing P<span style="font-style: italic;">eople vs. Cabral</span>, et al., (unpub.) 58 Phil. 946; <span style="font-style: italic;">Vide</span>, at p. 486).&nbsp; Verily, in criminal cases the admission of hearsay evidence would be a violation of the constitutional provision that the accused shall enjoy the right of being confronted with the witnesses testifying against him and to cross-examine them. Moreover, the court is without opportunity to test the credibility of hearsay statements by observing the demeanor of the person who supposedly made them (20 Am. Jur. 400-401; cited at 7-I, Francisco, Revised Rules of Court, 1973 ed., p. 437).<br><br>Of course, we are aware of the People's prerogative as to who will be presented to sit on the witness stand to establish the essential ingredients of the crime.&nbsp; There can hardly be any debate on this point, but the prosecution evidence must at all times be competent and admissible to sustain its stand.&nbsp; Surely, the prosecution can not rely for conviction on an imaginary person charging a serious offense without extending to the accused the benefit of confronting his accuser (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Bagano</span> (181 SCRA 747 [1990]).&nbsp; Withal, in default of a satisfactory premise for the non-presentation of a crucial witness like Carlos, it ineluctably follows that the disputable presumption that evidence deliberately withheld would be adverse if produced (Section 3(e), Rule 131, Revised Rules on Evidence) remains undisturbed.&nbsp; Moreover, the import of Carlos' "cooperation" specified under the third paragraph of the Joint Affidavit of Arrest is antithetical to the corollary axiom in remedial law of <span style="font-style: italic;">res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet</span> under Section 28, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court, in the absence of independent proof for the application of the exceptions to the established principle that a transaction between two persons ought not to operate to the prejudice of another.&nbsp; If, in People vs. Guillermo (93 SCRA 168; 176 [1979]); 1 <span style="font-style: italic;">Padilla</span>, Evidence, 1988 ed., p. 457) the confessions of the co-accused may not be accepted against the rest of the accused due to the <span style="font-style: italic;">res inter alios acta rule then, a fortiori</span>, the alleged "cooperation" of Carlos who was never presented as a witness in pointing to Melosantos as source of shabu must equally be repudiated.<br><br>Let us now shift the focus of discourse to the deportment of the witnesses of the People starting with the cross-examination of SPO1 Manlatao after he stated under the first paragraph of the Joint Affidavit of Arrest that Virgilio "Teng" Carlos was an "arrested suspect":<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr style="font-style: italic;"> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="JUSTIFY">Atty.

Bonete testified that CIC Cartel was approached by the alleged pusher.&nbsp; The conflict of the two (2) versions is irreconcilable.&nbsp; In this case, the commencement of the sales transaction is dependent on the initial contact between Cartel and the alleged pusher. It is improbable for Sgt. Bonete to have failed to notice that it was Cartel who approached the person who was sitting down rather than Bonicol approaching Cartel.&nbsp; This inevitably leads to the conclusion that either only one of the two (2) witnesses related the correct sequence of events or neither of them stated the true events.&nbsp; The records fail to show which of the two (2) conflicting versions is correct. And yet, the conviction of the accused cannot be based on speculations that the version consistent with guilt is correct.&nbsp; If the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two (2) or more explanations one or more of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then the test of moral certainty required to support a conviction is not met.</i><br><br>In addition to the

A supposition of this character is definitely not synonymous with the requisite quantum of proof.&nbsp; And in an effort to solve the enigma, the trial court even emphasized that "SPO1 Manlatao was emphatic when he said that SPO4 Velasco was at the gasoline station as a member of the back-up team" (p. 22, Decision; p. 233, Record).&nbsp; Again, we must stress that an assertion along this line by SPO1 Manlatao is radically opposed to SPO4 Velasco's description of his limited role, and consequently, must be received with the usual caveat<b> </b>when confronted with irreconcilable differences <span style="font-style: italic;">(People vs. Aranda, supra</span>).<br><br>The defense of accused-appellant appears to be shallow, yet the absence of depth would not warrant his conviction if, in the first place, the evidence of the People is anchored on a shaky foundation.&nbsp; This is but the necessary consequence of the adjective norm that the prosecution has the <span style="font-style: italic;">onus probandi</span> of establishing the guilt of the accused (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Sayat</span>, 223 SCRA 285; 290 [1993]); <span style="font-style: italic;">Sibal </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Salazar</span>, Compendium on Evidence, 1995, 4th ed., p. 297).&nbsp; At any rate, the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed cannot by itself, prevail against the constitutional presumption of innocence accorded the accused (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Salcedo</span>, 195 SCRA 345; 353 [1993]).<br><br>Much as we share the abhorence of the disenchanted public in regard to the proliferation of drug pushers, this Court cannot permit the incarceration of an individual based on insufficient factual nexus of that person's participation in the commission of the offense.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and another one entered acquitting ROLAND MELOSANTOS of the crime charged.&nbsp; His immediate release is hereby ordered unless he is detained for some other lawful cause.&nbsp; Costs<span style="font-style: italic;"> de oficio.</span><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Feliciano, (Chairman), Romero, Vitug</i>, and <i>Francisco, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div></div>
