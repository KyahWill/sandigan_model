				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Records show that respondent Judge Vicente N. <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>,
Jr., decided Civil Case No. 5654, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Amalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>, et al. vs.
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Empasis</span>, et al.," for cancellation of
document, recovery of possession and damages, against plaintiffs, now the
herein petitioners. The <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of the
decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. Dismissing the complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. Finding the
plaintiffs jointly and severally liable to defendant Segundo <span class="SpellE">Empasis</span> in the amount of Five Thousand Pe<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">s</span>os (P5,000.00) as moral damages and

<blockquote>“3. Finding the
plaintiffs jointly and severally liable to defendant Lorenzo L. <span class="SpellE">Eviota</span> in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) as
moral damages and another Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) as exemplary damages,

<blockquote>“4. Finding the
plaintiffs jointly and severally liable to defendants Segundo <span class="SpellE">Empasis</span> and Lorenzo L. <span class="SpellE">Eviota</span> for
Three Thousand Pesos (P3,000.00) as attorney's fee, with costs." (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above judgment became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
when the then Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal of herein petitioners due
to failure on their part to pay the docketing fee and to file a printed record
on appeal. As a consequence, the provincial sheriff levied on execution -</p>

<blockquote>(1) a parcel of land
with an area of 11 hectares, more or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">less,
</span>covered by Tax Declaration No. 1022-5499 in the Office of the Municipal
Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Malalag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and assessed at P3,350.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) a parcel of land with an area of 8 hectares, more or less,
covered by Tax Declaration No. 7532 and assessed at P2,250.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) a parcel of land with an area of 154 square meters more or
less, with one (1) residential house, both assessed at P1,620.00.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Said properties were sold at public auction by the Sheriff's
Office in favor of herein private respondents, Lorenzo L. <span class="SpellE">Eviota</span>
and Mariana <span class="SpellE">Eviota</span>, who were the highest bidders. A
"Provisional Certificate of Sale" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">covering the three parcels of land was issued by the sheriff in favor
of the <span class="SpellE">Eviotas</span>; and, thereafter, they were the
recipients of an "Absolute Deed of Sale" which was registered in the
Office of the Register of Deeds </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Davao</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, pursuant
to Act No. 3344.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">that </span>they
did not have any knowledge about the execution and sale at public auction of
the above?mentioned properties, so much so that they entered into a
milling contract with the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Sugar Company, Inc.
and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> planted sugarcane thereon; and,
that it was only after they had been served with the writ of possession that
they came to know about the aforesaid levy and sale. Whereupon, petitioners
filed an action against herein private respondents for annulment of the auction
sale and writ of possession, with prayer for the issuance of a preliminary
injunc­tion. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 528 before the then Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Digos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>. </span>The pre-trial of said case, according
to the private respondents in their memorandum, was held in abeyance until
after this Court shall have resolved the instant petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">for </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> (p. 100, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Rollo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, private respondents filed in Civil Case No. 5654
an "Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion to Authorize the Provincial
Sheriff of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to Execute an Absolute Deed of Sale of Lot No. 6124, Cad. <span class="GramE">275,
in the Name <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of</span> <span class="SpellE">Amalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tigdo</span> (<span class="SpellE">Amalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>) in Favor of
Lorenzo L. <span class="SpellE">Eviota</span> and Mariana <span class="SpellE">Eviota</span>,"
with the prayer that the Original Certi­ficate of Title No.</span>
(P-13390)-2379 covering the said lot issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Amalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>
be cancelled and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a new Transfer
Certificate of Title be issued by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
in their favor. Private respondents contend that Lot No. 6124 is the same
parcel of land covered by Tax Declaration No. 1022-5499 and mentioned in the
certificate of sale and deed of sale executed by the sheriff in their favor.
Respondent Judge, finding the aforesaid motion to be correct, issued an order,
dated </span><st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 15.0pt">July 1, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">,
granting it. (p. 33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) Hence, the filing of this
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction, petitioners
alleging that (1) the lower court had no jurisdiction over the case since the
land involved is situated in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and therefore the proper court to try the
case should be the Court </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">del </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Sur</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">; and, (2) the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">abused its discretion by not allowing the
herein petitioners to file their opposition to the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
motion mentioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining
respondent judge from enforcing and/or executing his order granting the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion filed by the private respondents and
authorizing the provincial sheriff <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> to execute the absolute deed of sale of Lot
No. 6124 in favor of said private respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first question raised, that of jurisdiction
(should be venue), petitioners are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
because they were the ones who filed Civil Case No. 5654 in the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">then
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Branch I. If what
they now claim is true, that the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> should be the one
to have tried the case because the lands involved are situated in that area,
why did they not file the case in said court? When they filed the case in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, they voluntarily submitted to its
jurisdiction and waived the issue </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">on
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">venue. A contrary rule would
encourage the undesirable practice of parties submitting their case in one
court in expectation of favorable judgment, but with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">intent </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of attacking its jurisdiction/venue should the decision be unfavorable.
Stated differently, a party </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cannot
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">invoke the jurisdiction of a
court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, failing to obtain
it <span class="GramE">repudiate</span> or question the same. </span>Such a
practice cannot be tolerated - a party accepting a judgment if favorable, and
attacking it for lack of jurisdiction when adverse. Besides, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> was just one of the branches of the
trial courts in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> and there is no material and/or
legal impediment for any of its branches to try the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">second </span>ground
of the petition, suffice <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">it to say that
the decision of respondent judge in Civil Case No. 5654 has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. As a consequence, the auction sale was made
after due publication, and the order of respondent judge granting an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the private
respondents was only one of the effects thereof. The contention that
petitioners were not given the opportunity to oppose the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
motion is without merit, for, why did petitioners not file a motion for
reconsideration? At any rate, respondent judge did not commit grave abuse of
discretion in granting the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED, and the tempo­rary
restraining order issued by this Court is hereby DISSOLVED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
