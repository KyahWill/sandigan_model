				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a simple ejectment case that should have been finally
decided at the lower levels of the Judiciary instead of having still to be
elevated to the highest tribunal.  The
Rule on Summary Procedure was intended to expedite the resolution of cases of
this nature, but even its application is now being questioned in this Court, and
at such intolerable length.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case arose in 1987, when petitioner Cynthia Santiago leased
for Gem-Luck Export Trading Office space located at the Cityland Condominium,
Makati, and belonging to the lessor, the Alyssia International Trade
Corporation.  The term was for one year
commencing on March 15, 1987, and the agreed monthly rental was P2,650.00.  A cash deposit equivalent to two months
rental was to be made (and in fact made) upon the execution of the contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 22, 1988, the lessor filed a complaint for ejectment
on the ground of non-payment of rentals and prayed for a writ of preliminary
attachment, which was granted on the same day.  On January 24, 1988, the lessee received summons and a copy of the
complaint, with notice that the case would be heard under the Rule on Summary
Procedure.  The sheriff attached one
refrigerator and two typewriters in the leased premises, as a result of which,
according to the petitioners, their office “was completely paralyzed.”</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 29, 1988, the petitioners moved for an extension of 10
days from February 1, 1988, to file their answer, giving pressure of work as
their reason.  On February 8, 1988,
Judge Romeo J. Lapuz of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Makati rendered a
decision disposing as follows<span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>As warranted by the facts alleged in the verified complaint,
judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendants:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  And all others claiming under them to vacate
the premises located at Rm. 214 Cityland Condominium 3, Herrera corner Esteban
Streets, Legaspi Village, Makati, Metro Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Ordering the defendants to pay the total
amounts of P18,011.16 and the stipulated 3% per month for each unpaid monthly
rents as of January 21, 1988 and the reasonable compensation for the use and
occupation of the leased premises at a monthly rental of P2,650.00 until they
finally vacate the same (par. 2, Lease Contract);</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Ordering the defendant to pay attorney’s
fees of P4,000.00 plus an appearance fee of P300.00 and the cost of suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners filed their answer on February 11, 1988.  Five days later, they were notified of the
decision and the denial of their motion for extension of time to file their
answer.  On February 22, 1988, they
filed a notice of appeal and posted a bond in the amount of P22,470.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their appeal, petitioner Edistio Fe. Soriano argued that he
was not a party to the lease contract and therefore could not be impleaded in
the ejectment case.  A third party claim
for the attached properties was also filed by Tri-Tracts Services, a corporation
headed by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 24, 1988, the private respondent filed a motion for the
withdrawal of the petitioners’ deposit with the court because of their failure
to pay the rentals for February and March.  The motion was granted and the withdrawal was allowed to be made by one
Atty. Mila T. Fideris.  The petitioners
objected on the ground that she was not a party to the case and that the
rentals should be charged, if at all, against the attached properties and not
the deposit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 18, 1988, Judge Teofilo Guadiz, Jr. affirmed the
challenged decision but increased the attorney’s fees to P8,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span>The court held that as an alleged occupant of the leased
premises, Edistio Santiago was a proper party defendant even if he had not
signed the lease contract.  It also
observed that as the term of the lease had already expired, the petitioners no
longer had any right to retain the leased premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners’ motion for reconsideration having been denied, a
writ of execution was finally issued on December 1, 1988, (following a number
of tedious legal skirmishes).  Petitioner Cynthia Santiago’s deposit with Metro Bank was garnished on
December 8, 1988.  The petitioners filed
yet another urgent motion to lift and recall the writ, which was also
denied.  Frustrated all the way, they
have now come to this Court for relief, claiming grave abuse of discretion on
the part of the respondent judges.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition will also fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners argue that they were denied due process when
Judge Lapuz decided the case on the basis of the complaint and documents filed
by the plaintiff, in disregard of the answer they submitted.  This argument is without merit.  Section 4 of the Rule on Summary Procedure
provides that upon being served with summons, the defendant must answer the
complaint within 10 days from service.  Should he fail to do so, the court <u>motu proprio</u> or on motion of
the plaintiff shall, pursuant to Section 5, render such judgment as may be
warranted by the facts alleged in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners received the summons on January 24, 1988.  Instead of submitting an answer, they filed
a motion for extension of time to file their answer, which motion was a
prohibited pleading under Sec. 15.  The
answer was finally filed on February 11, 1988, eight days in excess of the
period allowed by the Rule.  The court
therefore acted properly when it <u>motu proprio</u> decided the case on the
basis of the allegations and evidence of the complainant only.  Having failed to file their answer on time,
the petitioners cannot now claim that they were denied due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">To support their contention that Judge Lapuz should have waited
for their answer instead of deciding the case <u>motu proprio</u>, the
petitioners cite Zenith Films, Inc. vs. Herrera,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> where
the Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>Section 4 of Rule 5, concerning procedure in inferior courts,
provides that “the direction contained in the summons must be that the
defendant answer the complaint, and produce his evidence at a stated place, day
and hour, which shall not be less than two (2) days nor more than five (5) days
after the service of the summons if it be served in the municipality or city in
which the action is brought x x x” While it devolves upon the court itself to
observe the time limitation thus fixed when it issues the summons, the clear
import of the provision is that a defendant has up to the date set for trial
within which to file his answer to the complaint.  The City Court in this case did not observe the time limitation,
for it ordered the appellant “to answer the complaint and to enter trial on May
5, 1966, at 2 o’clock in the afternoon” - more than five (5) days after the
service of summons on April 19; but it is clear, not only from the wording of
the summons itself but also from the import of Section 4 of Rule 5, as
indicated above, that the appellant had until May 5, 1966 to answer the
complaint.  Consequently, the mere fact
that it filed a motion to dismiss instead of answering and that the said motion
did not contain a notice of hearing did not deprive it of the right to file an
answer to the complaint within the period expressly stated in the summons, that
is, up to May 5, nor justify the court in advancing the date for the reception
of the appellee’s evidence and rendering a default judgment.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That case is inapplicable for two reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The regular rules on civil procedure were followed in that case
whereas the case at bar was decided under the Rule on Summary Procedure, where
the only pleadings allowed are the complaint and the answer.  In Zenith, the defendant’s motion to dismiss
was not a prohibited pleading and so suspended his period to file an
answer.  In the case before us, the
motion for extension of time to file an answer, not being allowed by the Rule,
did not suspend the period to file the answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second and no less important distinction is that while the
court in Zenith failed to comply with its own order by deciding the case even
prior to the date set for hearing, the decision in this case was rendered
fifteen days after the petitioners were served with summons and a copy of the
complaint.  During this reasonably long
enough period, they failed to file their answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be added that even if the motion for extension of time
were not a prohibited pleading, the petitioners had no right to assume that it
would be automatically granted, especially if it is considered that they did
not offer a satisfactory reason for the extension they were seeking.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, such an extension would militate against the
following provision of the Rule on Summary Procedure, which are precisely intended
to expedite the proceedings in the cases mentioned therein:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 4.  <u>Answer</u>.  - Upon being served with summons, the
defendant must answer the complaint within ten (10) days from service
thereof.  The answer to <span style="">a </span>counterclaim or crossclaim must be filed
within ten (10) days from service thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 5.  <u>Effect of
failure to answer</u>.  - Should the
defendant fail to answer the complaint, crossclaim or permissive counterclaimm
within the reglementary 10-day period herein provided, the court <u>motu proprio</u>,
or on motion of the plaintiff, shall render judgment as may be warranted by the
facts alleged in the complaint and limited to what is prayed for therein except
as to the amount of damages which the court may reduce in its discretion.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners aver that the metropolitan trial court had no
jurisdiction because no demand to vacate and pay accrued rentals had been made
on them.  However, they have not proved
this alleged deficiency as their answer was filed tardily and so was correctly
not considered by the court.  Under the
aforequoted Section 5, the judge was justified in relying on the allegations in
the complaint alone in finding that the requisite demands were indeed made on
the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to stress that the private respondent attached to
the complaint its letter to the petitioners demanding that they vacate the
leased premises and pay the accrued rentals.  The veracity of its content was never refuted by the petitioners, again
because of their failure to submit their answer on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the regularity of the attachment order, we note that
prior to the issuance of the writ of attachment, the required affidavit and <span style="">a </span>bond for P18,011.16 were duly filed
by the plaintiff in accordance with Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 57 of the Rules of
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners argue that the writ should not have covered the
properties of the Tri-Tract Services, which at that time were being used by
Cynthia Santiago.  The Court is not
persuaded.  The record shows that the
president and chairman of the board of directors of the said corporation is
petitioner Edistio Fe. Santiago, who, even in the pleadings signed by him as
petitioners’ counsel, indicated his address at the disputed leased
premises.  As he was an occupant of the
said premises without the consent of the lessor and a co-defendant in the
ejectment case, the properties found in the said premises which he claimed as
his own could be the subject of attachment.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also maintain that they should have first been
furnished with a copy of the final decision before a writ of execution could be
validly enforced against them.  Formal
service of the judgment is indeed necessary as a rule but not, as it happens,
in the case at bar.  The reason is that
the petitioners had filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision of Judge
Guadiz, which would indicate that they were then already informed of such
decision.  The petitioners cannot now
invoke due process on the basis of a feigned ignorance as the lack of formal
notice cannot prevail against the fact of actual notice.</p>

<blockquote>On the validity of the order allowing Atty. Fideris to withdraw
from the deposits with the MTC and the RTC, the same is resoluble under Section
8 of Rule 70 of the Rules <span style="">of </span>Court,
which states:</blockquote>

<blockquote>SEC.<span style=""> </span>8.  <u>Immediate execution of judgment.  How to stay same</u>.  - If judgment is rendered against the
defendant, execution shall issue immediately, unless an appeal has been
perfected and the defendant to stay execution files a sufficient bond, approved
by the municipal or city court and executed to the plaintiff to enter the
action in the Court of First Instance and to pay the rents, damages, and costs
accruing down to the time of the judgment appealed from and unless during the
pendency of the appeal, he deposits with the appellate court the amount of rent
due from time to time under the contract, if any, is found by the judgment of
the municipal or city court to exist.  In the absence of a contract, he shall deposit with the court the
reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises for the preceding
month or period at the rate determined by the judgment, on or before the tenth
day of each succeeding month or period.  The supersedeas bond shall be transmitted by the municipal or city
court, with the other papers, to the clerk of the Court of First Instance to
which the action is appealed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All moneys so paid to the appellate court shall be deposited in the
provincial or city treasury, and shall be held there until the final
disposition of the appeal, unless the court, by agreement of the interested
parties, or in the absence of reasonable grounds opposition to a motion to
withdraw, or for<span style=""> </span>justifiable
reasons, shall decree otherwise.  Should
the defendant fail to make the payments above prescribed from time to time
during the pendency of the appeal, the appellate court, upon motion of the
plaintiff, of which the defendant shall have notice, and upon proof of such
failure, shall order the execution of the judgment appealed from with respect
to the restoration of possession, but such execution shall not be a bar to the
appeal taking its course until the final disposition thereof on its merits.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the withdrawal of the deposits was the
petitioners’ failure to pay on time the rentals for the months of February and
March, 1988.  As the Court held in
Carbungco v. Amparo,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
citing <span style="">a </span>long line of cases:</p>

<blockquote>x x x Contrary to the provisions of law, particularly Rule 72,
Section 8, Rules of Court, the appellant in this detainer case failed to
deposit in court within the first ten days of the succeeding month (May 1948)
the rental corresponding to the previous month (April 1948).  This deposit was actually made three days
after the end of the ten-day period, that is to say, on May 13, 1948.  The law and the authorities are, however,
clear that this legal provision about the deposit of the rental corresponding
to the previous month within the first ten days of the succeeding month, is
mandatory; that upon violation thereof by the defendant-appellant, the
plaintiff-appellee has the right to ask for execution pending appeal; and that
the court is left no discretion to either extend the period of deposit
prescribed by law, postpone the making of said deposit, or otherwise relieve
the appellant of the consequences of her or his failure to make the deposit
within the precise period prescribed by law.<sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;">5</span><o:p></o:p></sup></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners argue that they did not deposit the rentals for
these months because the value of the attached properties was already more than
sufficient to cover such rentals.  They
also contend that the cash deposit was at that time also sufficient to cover
the rentals for the months of September 1987 to March 1988, for which reason it
was no longer necessary to maintain the attachment.  If that be so, what they should have done - but did not - was
file a motion to lift the said attachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the court allowed <span style="">a </span>person who was not a party to the action to receive the
withdrawn deposit did not make the order irregular.  There is no question that Atty. Fideris was authorized by the
plaintiff to make the withdrawal and so was acting for a party to the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last major issue raised requires a computation of the
petitioners’ total liability.  They have
admitted that they failed to pay the rentals from September 1987 to January
1988 and from April 1988 to December 5, 1988, (the date when they were ejected
from the premises).  All in all, their
accrued unpaid rentals would be for thirteen and a half months and, at the
monthly rate of P2,650.00, would amount to P35,775.00, to which should be added
the stipulated 3% interest per month for each unpaid monthly rental starting
June<span style=""> 1988.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style=""> </span>To be deducted from this amount are
the cash deposit of P22,470.00 and the two months advance deposit of P5,300.00
which was received by the lessor at the commencement of the lease.  We find the attorney’s fee of P8,000.00 to
be reasonable; indeed, it is even less than the P15,000.00 minimum fee
stipulated in the lease contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respect for the Rule on Summary Procedure as a practicable norm
for the expeditious resolution of cases like the one at bar could have avoided
this lengthy litigation that has unduly imposed on the time of the Court.  Counsel are admonished against abuse of the
judicial process by misinterpretation if not deliberate misapplication of the
law for their own dubious purposes to the prejudice of the speedy and effective
administration of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court dated
July 18, 1988, is hereby modified.  The
total liabilities of the petitioner should only be P35,775.00 plus the
stipulated 3% interest per month for each unpaid monthly rental from July 1988
to December 1988, less the cash payments of P27,730.00.  This amount shall be subject to a 6%
interest per annum commencing from the time the petitioners vacate the premises
until full payment is made.  The
garnishment order dated December 8, 1988, is lifted in view of the sufficiency
of the properties.</p>
