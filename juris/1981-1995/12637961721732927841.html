from the plaintiff the cancellation of the tax declaration in the name of <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> so that another

<blockquote>If the decision of the Court of Appeals on the controversial matter
suffers, as it does, from some ambig­uity, the doubt should be resolved to
sustain the trial court in the light of the familiar and accepted rule that
"the judge who tries a case in the court below, has vastly superior
advantage for the ascertainment of truth and the detection of falsehood over an
appellate court sitting as a court of review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellate court can merely follow with the eye, the cold words of
the witness as transcribed upon the record, knowing at the same time, from
actual expe­rience, that more or less, of what the witness actually did say, is
always lost in the process of transcribing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">main
</span>difficulty does not lie here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is an inherent impossibility of determining with any degree of
