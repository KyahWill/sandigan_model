<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1989</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">The day following his receipt of the resolution, or on <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1989</st1:date>, the petitioner
filed the instant petition.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1989</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed an urgent motion with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
requesting that the execution and implementation of the <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1989</st1:date> suspension order be held in
abeyance pending determination of the merits of the petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied prompting the
petitioner to ask the Court for an earlier setting of the trial of the cases
which was denied in an order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="2">February
 22, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In denying the plea for an earlier schedule of the trial of the
cases, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> said:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court notes that these cases have already been set for
May 15, 16 and 17 as well as June 5, 6 and 7, 1989 at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning and <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the accused claims that this period is <span class="SpellE">ordinately</span> far, the Court must also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">be </span>contend <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">with </span>its
own calendar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be easy enough for
this Court to give the accused an earlier setting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, such a setting will be best a
pretence since other cases have already been set between now and May 15 where
in many instances the accused themselves are also under suspension by reason of
the same provision of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the
above circumstances, no other earlier setting can be granted to the accused
without making that setting merely a sham since other cases which have been set
earlier will naturally have a right to expect priority." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 135)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of this development, the petitioner filed an urgent supplemental
application for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary
injunction to enjoin the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, the Secretary
of Local Government and Community Development, and all those acting in their
behalf from executing and implementing the February 10, 1989 resolution of the <span class="SpellE">Sandigabayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We treat the respondent's Comment as an answer and decide this
petition on its merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner questions the constitutionality of the suspension
provision of Section 13 of the Anti-Graft Law (Republic Act. <span class="GramE">No.
3019).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">This same issue was raised in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Layno</u></span>
<u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Sandiganbayan</u></span> (136 SCRA 536
(1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After considering the facts as
well as the merits of the case, the Court ruled that the petition need not be
resolved through a ruling on the validity of the provision on mandatory
suspension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We instead, decided the case
in relation to the principles of due process and equal protection of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Faced with similar factual circumstances in the instant petition,
we apply anew the ruling in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Layno</u></span> case and
decide the instant petition in relation to the principles of due process and
equal protection without having to declare categorically whether or not the
suspension provision of Republic Act 3019 should be struck down as invalid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We limit ourselves to ascertaining whether or
not, under the circumstances of this case, an indefinite suspension becomes
unreasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as 1974, then Justice Fred Ruiz Castro expressed in a
separate opinion the mischief which would result if the Court allows the indefinite
suspension of elective local officials charged with violations of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act:</p>

<blockquote>"The central point of Senator Padilla's position is ‘that the
penalty of suspension is definitely much lower than that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>removal and it would be incongruous
if we give to the penalty of suspension more serious consequences than are
attached to the penalty of removal.’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Senator Padilla opted for the immediate restoration of the respondent to
his position once the favorable result of the election is known.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Parenthetically, it must be stated that while there was an
exchange of views between Senator <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> and Senator <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span> on the Anti-Graft Law, the exchange was limited
to the matter of the commencement of the investigation of the charges, which,
according to Senator <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, cannot be made within
one year prior to an election.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And so it is that, on the basis of my discussion above, I
bewail the apathy of the majority of the Court toward efforts to seek enlightenment
on legal issues of grave importance from the deliberations of Congress upon the
said issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not quite becoming of
judicial magistrates to shunt aside a suggestion that the interplay of legal
provisions be carefully studied and analyzed.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">"In </span>the
deliberations of the Court on this case, I suggested that we examine the
possible delimiting effects of the provisions of the first sentence of section
5 of the Decentralization Act on the provisions of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act insofar as the suspension from office of an elective local
official is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In no uncertain
words did I focus the attention of the Court on the serious ever-present
possibility of harassment of an elective local official taking the form of the
filing of <span class="GramE">a valid</span> information against him under the
provisions of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act after his exoneration in
an administrative case involving the same offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I also pointedly brought out the matter of the notorious
delay in the courts of justice which could effectively frustrate an elected or
re-elected local official from discharging the duties of his office for the
entire term of his office, and thus nullify the will of the people who elected
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I likewise asked the Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">to </span>consider <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">the situation </span>where an elective local official runs for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">National Assembly </span>and is elected <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">despite </span>the fact that he is under
suspension under the authority of the provisions of the Anti-Graft <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">and </span>Corrupt Practices Act, and sought a
definitive answer to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘What then would happen to the suspension
meted out to him since it is the National Assembly that determines whether he
should assume and continue in office?’<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"All these and other germane questions were brushed aside by
the majority of the Court with the sweeping statement that the provisions of
the Decentralization Act apply only to administrative cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the <u>ex</u> <u>cathedra</u> attitude,
this kind of slothful <span class="GramE">thinking, that</span> I find abhorrent
and therefore deplore." (<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, 57 SCRA 163, 197-198 [1974])</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> was elected governor
of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zambales</span></st1:placename></st1:place> in the <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1988</st1:date> local
elections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The regular term of a

 1992</st1:date> by special provision of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Section 8, Article X, Section 2, Article
XVIII, Constitution).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was, however,
ordered suspended from performing his duties as governor by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> pursuant to Section 13 of Republic Act No.
3019 by virtue of the criminal charges filed against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order of suspension does not have a
definite period so that the petitioner may be suspended for the rest of his
term of office unless his case is terminated sooner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An extended suspension is a distinct
possibility considering that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> denied
the petitioner's plea for earlier dates of trial of his cases on the ground
that <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">there</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> <u>are</u> <u>other</u> <u>cases</u> </span><u>set</u>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances the preventive suspension which initially
may be justified becomes unreasonable thus raising a due process question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Layno</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

innocence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A preventive suspension may

for an unreasonable length of time raises a due process question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For even if thereafter he were acquitted, in

sense, to paraphrase Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, the protracted
continuance of this preventive suspension had outrun the bounds of reason and

the start of said suspension.’ <span class="GramE">(Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337, Section 63 (2), last sentence.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">The </span>first
sentence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">reads as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘</span>Preventive suspension may be imposed
at any time after the issues are joined, when there is reasonable ground to
believe that the respondent has committed the act or acts complained of, when
the evidence of culpability is strong, when the gravity of the offense so
warrants, or when the continuance in office of the respondent influence the
witnesses or pose a threat to the safety and integrity of the records and other
evidence’).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be recalled that the
principle against indefinite suspension applies equally to national government
officials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So it was held in the leading
case of Garcia v. Hon. Secretary (116 Phil. 348 [1962]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the opinion of Justice
Barrera:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘To adopt the theory of
respondents that an officer appointed by the President, facing administrative
charges, can be preventively suspended indefinitely, would be to countenance a
situation where the preventive suspension can, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">in </span>effect, be the penalty itself without a finding of guilt after
due hearing, contrary to the express mandate of the Constitution and the Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Service </span>Law.’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid. 351-352) Further:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘In the guise of a preventive suspension, his
term of office could be shortened and he could in effect, be removed without a
finding of a cause duly established after due hearing, in violation of the
Constitution.’ (Ibid. 352) <span class="GramE">Clearly then, the policy of the
law mandated by the Constitution frowns at a suspension of indefinite duration.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">In </span>this particular case, the mere fact that petitioner is facing
a charge under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act does not justify a
different rule of law.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To do so
would be to negate the safeguard of the equal protection guarantee." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 542)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The application of the <u>Garcia</u> injunction against
preventive suspensions for an unreasonable period of time applies with greater
force to elective officials and especially to the petitioner whose term is a
relatively short one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The interests <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the sovereign electorate and the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zambales</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
cannot be subordinated to the heavy case load of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
and of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be most unfair to the people of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
who elected the petitioner to the highest provincial office in their command if
they are deprived of his services for an indefinite period with the termination
of his case possibly extending beyond his entire term simply because the big
number of sequestration, ill-gotten, wealth, murder, <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
of public funds and other more serious offenses plus incidents and resolutions
that may be brought to the Supreme Court prevents the expedited determination
of his innocence or guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="2">February
 10, 1989</st1:date> suspending the petitioner without a definite period can
not be sanctioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We rule that
henceforth a preventive suspension of an elective public officer under Section
13 of Republic Act 3019 should be limited to the ninety (90) days under Section
42 of Presidential Decree No. 807, the Civil Service Decree, which period also
appears reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also questions the applicability of Section 13 of
Republic Act 3019 as amended by <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 192 to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">opines
</span>that the suspension provision as amended which qualifies the public
officer as <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">incumbent</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>does not apply to him since he is now
occupying the position of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">governor</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and not <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">mayor</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>the
position wherein he was charged under the Anti-Graft Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The issue was settled in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bayot</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sandiganbayan</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>(128 SCRA 383 (1984), in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Further, the claim of petitioner that he cannot be suspended because he is
presently occupying a position different from that under which he is charged is
untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amendatory provision
clearly states that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">any incumbent
public officer against whom any criminal prosecution under a valid information
under Republic Act 3019 or for any offense involving fraud upon the government
or public funds or property whether as a simple or as a complex offense and in
whatever stage or execution and mode of participation, is pending </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">court, shall be suspended from office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, by the use of the word 'office' the same applies to any office
which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">officer charged may be holding, and not only
the particular office under which he was charged."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">One last point.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Should the purposes behind preventive
suspensions such as preventing the abuse of the prerogatives of the office,
intimidation of witnesses, etc., become manifest, the respondent court is not
bereft of remedies or sanctions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner may still be suspended but for specifically expressed reasons and
not from an automatic application of Section 13 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The preventive suspension imposed on
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>
