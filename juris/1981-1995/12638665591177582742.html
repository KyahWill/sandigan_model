<p class="BODY">The case at bar arose from a complaint filed by the private

executed on July 7, 1971.</p>

total area, of a parcel of land covered by Original Certificate of Title No.
575 of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, issued and
registered in the name of the petitioner which it sold to the private
respondent for and in consideration of P123,930.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crux of the instant controversy lies in the compliance or
non-compliance by the private respondent with the provision for payment to the
petitioner of the principal balance of P100,000.00 and the accrued interest of
P24,000.00 within the grace period.</p>

<p class="BODY">A chronological narration of the antecedent facts is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 7, 1971, the subject contract over the land in question
was executed between the petitioner as vendor and the private respondent
through its then president, Mr. Carlos F. Robes, as vendee, stipulating for a <span class="SpellE">downpayment</span> of P23,930.00 and the balance of P100,000.00
plus 12% interest per annum to be paid within four (4) years from execution of
the contract, that is, on or before July 7, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract likewise provides for
cancellation, forfeiture of previous payments, and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of the land in question in case the private respondent would fail to complete
payment within the said period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1973</st1:date>,
the private respondent, through its new president, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Adalia</span>
Francisco, addressed a letter<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
to Father Vasquez, parish priest of San Jose Del Monte, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
requesting to be furnished with a copy of the subject contract and the
supporting documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 17, 1975, admittedly after the expiration of the
stipulated period for payment, the same Atty. Francisco wrote the petitioner a
formal request<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
that her company be allowed to pay the principal amount of P100,000.00 in three
(3) equal installments of six (6) months each with the first installment and
the accrued interest of P24,000.00 to be paid immediately upon approval of the
said request.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 29, 1975, the petitioner, through its counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> Fernandez, formally denied the said request of the
private respondent, but granted the latter a grace period of five (5) days from
the receipt of the denial<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
to pay the total balance of P124,000.00, otherwise, the provisions of the
contract regarding cancellation, forfeiture, and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
would be implemented.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1975</st1:date>,
the private respondent, through its president, Atty. Francisco, wrote<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the counsel of the petitioner requesting an extension of 30 days from said date
to fully settle its account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counsel
for the petitioner, Atty. Fernandez, received the said letter on the same
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon consultation with the
petitioner in <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
Atty. Fernandez, as instructed, wrote the private respondent a letter<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1975</st1:date>
informing the latter of the denial of the request for an extension of the grace
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, Atty. Francisco, the private respondent's
president, wrote a letter<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1975</st1:date>,
directly addressed to the petitioner, protesting the alleged refusal of the
latter to accept tender of payment purportedly made by the former on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1975</st1:date>, the last day of the
grace period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same letter of
August 22, 1975, received on the following day by the petitioner, the private
respondent demanded the execution of a deed of absolute sale over the land in
question and after which it would pay its account in full, otherwise, judicial
action would be resorted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1975</st1:date>,
the petitioner's counsel, Atty. Fernandez, wrote a reply<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
to the private respondent stating the refusal of his client to execute the deed
of absolute sale due to its (private respondent's) failure to pay its full
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the petitioner
denied that the private respondent had made any tender of payment whatsoever
within the grace period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this
alleged breach of contract, the petitioner cancelled the contract and
considered all previous payments forfeited and the land as ipso facto <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From a perusal of the foregoing facts, we find that both the
contending parties have conflicting versions on the main question of tender of
payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in its ratiocination, preferred not to give
credence to the evidence presented by the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the trial court:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> What made Atty. Francisco suddenly decide to pay
plaintiff's obligation on August 5, 1975, go to defendant's office at <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, and there tender her payment, when her request of
August 4, 1975 had not yet been acted upon until August 7 1975?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Atty. Francisco had decided to pay the
obligation and had available funds for the purpose on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1975</st1:date>, then there would have been no need
for her to write defendant on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="8">August 4,
 1975</st1:date> to request an extension of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Atty. Francisco's claim that she made
a tender of payment on August 5, 1975 -- such alleged act, considered in
relation to the circumstances both antecedent and subsequent thereto, being not
in accord with the normal pattern of human conduct -- is not worthy of
credence.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court likewise noted the inconsistency in the testimony
of Atty. Francisco, president of the private respondent, who earlier testified
that a certain Mila <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> accompanied her on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1975</st1:date> to the office of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another person, however,
named Aurora <span class="SpellE">Oracion</span>, was presented to testify as the
secretary-companion of Atty. Francisco on that same occasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the trial court considered as fatal the failure of
Atty. Francisco to present in court the certified personal check allegedly
tendered as payment or, at least, its <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy, or
even bank records thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the
trial court found that the private respondent had insufficient funds available
to fulfill the entire obligation considering that the latter, through its
president, Atty. Francisco, only had a savings account deposit of P64,840.00,
and although the latter had a money-market placement of P300,000.00, the same
was to mature only after the expiration of the 5-day grace period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the above considerations, the trial court rendered a
decision in favor of the petitioner, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">WHEREFORE, finding plaintiff to have failed to make out its case,
the court hereby declares the subject contract cancelled and plaintiff's down
payment of P23,930.00 forfeited in favor of defendant, and hereby dismisses the
complaint; and on the counterclaim, the Court orders plaintiff to pay
defendant.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.0001pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Attorney's fees of P10,000.00;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.0001pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Litigation expenses of P2,000.00; and</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.0001pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judicial costs.</p>

<p class="2Q">SO ORDERED.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the said decision, the private respondent
appealed to the respondent Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals)
assigning as reversible errors, among others, the findings of the trial court
that the available funds of the private respondent were insufficient and that
the latter did not effect a valid tender of payment and consignation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court, in reversing the decision of the trial
court, essentially relies on the following findings:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We are convinced from the testimony of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Adalia</span> Francisco and her witnesses that in behalf of the
plaintiff-appellant they have a total available sum of P364,840.00 at her and
at the plaintiff's disposal on or before August 4, 1975 to answer for the obligation
of the plaintiff-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
correct for the trial court to conclude that the plaintiff-appellant had only
about P64,840.00 in savings deposit on or before August 5, 1975, a sum not
enough to pay the outstanding account of P124,000.00. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The plaintiff-appellant, through Atty.
Francisco proved and the trial court even acknowledged that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Adalia</span> Francisco had about P300,000.00 in money market
placement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The error of the trial court
lies in concluding that the money market placement of P300,000.00 was out of
reach of Atty. Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as
testified to by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>,
a representative of the Insular Bank of Asia and America, Atty. Francisco could
withdraw anytime her money market placement and place it at her disposal, thus
proving her financial capability of meeting more than the whole of P124,000.00
then due per contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This situation,
We believe, proves the truth that Atty. Francisco apprehensive that her request
for a 30-day grace period would be denied, she tendered payment on August 4,
1975 which offer defendant through its representative and counsel refused to
receive. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the respondent court, finding that the private
respondent had sufficient available funds, ipso facto concluded that the latter
had tendered payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is such conclusion
warranted by the facts proven?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner submits that it is not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner presents the following issues for resolution:</p>

<p class="2Q">xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
a finding that private respondent had sufficient available funds on or before
the grace period for the payment of its obligation proof that it (private
respondent) did tender of (sic) payment for its said obligation within said
period?</p>

<p class="2Q">xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">B.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
it the legal obligation of the petitioner (as vendor) to execute a deed of
absolute sale in favor of the private respondent (as vendee) before the latter

between and executed by the parties stipulates -</p>

<p class="3Q">"That upon complete payment of the agreed consideration by the
herein VENDEE, the VENDOR shall cause the execution of a Deed of Absolute Sale
in favor of the VENDEE.”</p>

<p class="2Q">xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">C.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
an offer of a check a valid tender of payment of an obligation under a contract
which stipulates that the consideration of the sale is in Philippine Currency?<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first issue, we agree with the petitioner
that a finding that the private respondent had sufficient available funds on or
before the grace period for the payment of its obligation does not constitute
proof of tender of payment by the latter for its obligation within the said
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tender of payment involves a
positive and unconditional act by the obligor of offering legal tender currency
as payment to the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> for the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
obligation and demanding that the latter accept the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, tender of payment cannot be presumed by
a mere inference from surrounding circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, sufficiency of available funds is
only affirmative of the capacity or ability of the obligor to fulfill his part
of the bargain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But whether or not the
obligor avails himself of such funds to settle his outstanding account remains
to be proven by independent and credible evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tender of payment presupposes not only that
the obligor is able, ready, and willing, but more so, in the act of performing
his obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><b style="">Ab</b></span><b style=""> posse ad <span class="SpellE">actu</span> non vale <span class="SpellE">illatio</span>.</b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A proof that an act could have been
done is no proof that it was actually done."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court was therefore in error to have concluded
from the sheer proof of sufficient available funds on the part of the private
respondent to meet more than the total obligation within the grace period, the
alleged truth of tender of payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same is a classic case of <b style="">non-sequitur.</b></p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the respondent court finds itself remiss in
overlooking or taking lightly the more important findings of fact made by the
trial court which we have earlier mentioned and which as a rule, are entitled
to great weight on appeal and should be accorded full consideration and respect
and should not be disturbed unless for strong and cogent reasons.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While the Court is not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of
facts, yet, when the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are at variance
with those of the trial court,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
or when the inference of the Court of Appeals from its findings of fact is
manifestly mistaken,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court has to review the evidence in order to arrive at the correct findings
based on the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apropos the second issue raised, although admittedly the
documents for the deed of absolute sale had not been prepared, the subject
contract clearly provides that the full payment by the private respondent is an
a priori condition for the execution of the said documents by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="2Q">That upon complete payment of the agreed consideration by the
herein VENDEE, the VENDOR shall cause the execution of a Deed of Absolute Sale
in favor of the VENDEE.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent is therefore in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
to claim otherwise as the latter did in the testimony in cross-examination of
its president, Atty. Francisco, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
you mentioned, Atty. Francisco, that you wanted the defendant to execute the
final deed of sale before you would given (sic) the personal certified check in
payment of your balance, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Art. 1159 of the Civil Code of the Philippines provides that
"obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the
contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith." And unless
the stipulations in said contract are contrary to law, morals, good customs,
public order, or public policy, the same are binding as between the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What the private respondent should have done if it was indeed
desirous of complying with its obligations would have been to pay the
petitioner within the grace period and obtain a receipt of such payment duly
issued by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, or,
allowing a reasonable time, the private respondent could have demanded from the
petitioner the execution of the necessary documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case the petitioner refused, the private
respondent could have had always resorted to judicial action for the legitimate
enforcement of its right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
failure of the private respondent to undertake this more judicious course of
action, it alone shall suffer the consequences.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the third issue, granting <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>
that we would rule affirmatively on the two preceding issues, the case of the
private respondent still can not succeed in view of the fact that the latter
used a certified personal check which is not legal tender nor the currency
stipulated, and therefore, can not constitute valid tender of payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first paragraph of Art. 1249 of the Civil
Code provides that "the payment of debts in money shall be made in the
currency stipulated, and if it is not possible to deliver such currency, then
in the currency which is legal tender in the Philippines.</p>

G.R. No. L-49188, stated thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">Since a negotiable instrument is only a substitute for money and
not money, the delivery of such an instrument does not, by itself, operate as
payment (citing Sec. 189, Act 2031 on <span class="SpellE">Negs</span>. <span class="SpellE">Insts</span>.; Art. 1249, Civil Code; Bryan London Co. v. American
Bank, 7 Phil. 255; Tan <span class="SpellE">Sunco</span> v. Santos, 9 Phil. 44;
21 R.C.L. 60, 61).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A check, whether a
manager's check or ordinary check, is not legal tender, and an offer of a check
in payment of a debt is not a valid tender of payment and may be refused
receipt by the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> or creditor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, where the tender of payment by the private respondent was
not valid for failure to comply with the requisite payment in legal tender or
currency stipulated within the grace period and as such, was validly refused
receipt by the petitioner, the subsequent consignation did not operate to
discharge the former from its obligation to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the petitioner in the legitimate
exercise of its rights pursuant to the subject contract, did validly order
therefore the cancellation of the said contract, the forfeiture of the previous
payment, and the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> ipso facto of the land
in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> is
GRANTED and the DECISION of the respondent court promulgated on April 25, 1985
is hereby SET ASIDE and ANNULLED and the DECISION of the trial court dated May
25, 1981 is hereby REINSTATED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs
