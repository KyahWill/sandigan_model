				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In order for conviction to lie, all the elements of the crime must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In the case of murder, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to muster the evidence required by the Constitution to show not only that the unlawful killing was perpetrated by the accused, but also that any of the attendant circumstances that qualify it to murder exists.&nbsp; If it cannot be proven with moral certainty that at least one of the qualifying circumstances enumerated in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code is present, the prosecution fails in its task, and the accused must be freed from liability for murder.<br><br>The case at bench commenced upon the filing on June 13, 1988 of an Information before the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta, Pangasinan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> charging appellant <b>JUAN MADAYAG GONZAGA, JR.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of murdering <b>SERVILLANO VILLANUEVA MANUEL, JR.</b>, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 1<sup>st </sup>day of April 1988, in the evening, at Barangay Bayaoas, Municipality of Urdaneta, Province of Pangasinan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then armed with a single bladed bolo, called "<i>Panabas</i>",<i> </i>measuring about 26 inches including its handle, with deliberate intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and hack one Servillano Manuel, Jr. y Villanueva, inflicting upon him the following injuries, to wit:<br><br>"Significant External Findings:<br><br>-&nbsp; Abrasion, both knees; abrasion, right shoulder, lateral aspect; abrasion, right forefinger and middle finger; abrasion, chin, right half; abrasion with ecchysmosis, right temple near right eye;<br>-&nbsp;

Fracture, linear, left half of frontal bone, 5 cms. long;<br></blockquote><br>which caused the death of Servillano Manuel, Jr., y Villanueva as a consequence, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs."<br><br>Appellant was arraigned.&nbsp; He pleaded <i>not guilty </i>to the charge levelled against him.&nbsp; Trial ensued.<br><br>The records show that appellant and Servillano Manuel, Jr. lived in the same neighborhood in Sitio Las Vegas, Barangay Bayaoas, Urdaneta, Pangasinan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; During his lifetime, Servillano worked as a <i>kristo</i>,<i> </i>or cockpit bet caller, and as a collector in carnival shows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Before his arrest, appellant was working part-time as a laborer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The prosecution produced an eyewitness in the person of <b>ELINO MANUEL</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Servillano's younger brother.&nbsp; Elino narrated that sometime after five o'clock in the afternoon (5:00 p.m.) of April 1, 1988, appellant came to their house looking for Servillano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Failing to find him there, appellant boxed the door of the Manuel residence twice and left in a huff.&nbsp; "<i>Hutdon mong tanan, patyon mong tanan,</i>"<i> </i>he uttered in Visayan as he left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Chills ran down Elino's spine.&nbsp; In his mind, he translated appellant's threat: "I will kill you all!"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Fearing for his brother's life, Elino rushed to the corner of Las Vegas Road and Sison Street, where he expected Servillano to pass on his way home from the poblacion.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was wrong, for Servillano opted to take an alternate route back to their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After waiting in vain at the corner for about an hour, Elino headed home.&nbsp; On his way, he caught sight of appellant hacking Servillano with a bolo about fifteen (15) meters from where he was.&nbsp; Servillano was then stooped forward and away from appellant, with his head down and backside pointed upward.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Immobilized by shock, Elino witnessed appellant strike Servillano four times, and then throw aside the bloodied bolo he used.&nbsp; Appellant escaped on-board a tricycle, together with his brother-in-law, Ernesto Adame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Servillano's body was autopsied on the morning of April 2, 1988, by rural health unit physician <b>DR. RAMON GONZALES, JR.</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> who found the cause of death to be "irreversible shock due to arterial hemorrhage caused by the hacking wound, neck."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; His findings were reduced to a written report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the contents of which are quoted in and incorporated into the Information filed against appellant.<br><br>The defense did not challenge the result of the autopsy conducted on Servillano's body, and did not question the medical findings as to the cause of death.&nbsp; Appellant, in fact, admitted that he inflicted the fatal hacked wounds on Servillano.&nbsp; However, appellant sought shelter behind the doctrine of self-defense.&nbsp; He and his wife, <b>MARILOU GANZAGAN</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> related a completely different version of what transpired on the day Servillano died.<br><br>The Ganzagas testified that at around five o'clock in the afternoon (5:00 p.m.) of April 1, 1988, they were at home.&nbsp; Marilou was then downstairs, preparing some <i>bilo-bilo</i>, while appellant was on the upper level of the house, watching over their two-month-old infant daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Suddenly, Servillano Manuel, Jr., who was visibly upset, barged into their house, looking for appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; He left hurriedly without waiting for appellant to come down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Not long after, Servillano returned to the Ganzagan residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; This time, he was armed with a bolo, with which he stuck the house near the kitchen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant confronted Servillano who cursed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and abruptly assaulted the former with the bolo.&nbsp; He delivered an overhead hacking blow<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to appellant, who stepped back and parried the same with his right arm.&nbsp; The tip of the bolo hit the appendage and produced a three-centimeter nick on it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Marilou rushed out of their house onto the street, screaming for help.&nbsp; None came to her aid, as everyone was attending a procession along the Urdaneta-Asingan provincial road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; When she returned to their house, neither appellant nor Servillano was there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; She did not think to look for the two, and merely remained inside their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, after a brief tussle with Servillano, appellant was able to wrest the bolo away from him. With bolo in hand, appellant ran to the middle of the road street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; He stopped when he remembered his baby, who was left alone in their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; For the next five minutes, appellant stood transfixed on the road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The impasse was broken by Servillano who renewed his attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In trying to grab the bolo back from appellant, Servillano stumbled and fell forward, face down and with his backside pointing up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; It was then that appellant hacked Servillano several times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Appellant fled from the scene of the crime.&nbsp; He went into hiding,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and a week passed after the incident before his wife saw him again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Much later, during the pendency of the trial against him, appellant jumped bail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In rebuttal, the prosecution submitted in evidence a certification of the death of the Ganzagas' four-month-old son, Michael, on January 15, 1988, barely two-and-a-half (2 1/2) months before Servillano's killing.<br><br>At the close of trial, the court <i>a </i><i>quo </i>decided against appellant.&nbsp; It held:<br><br>"The killing was qualified by evident premeditation and treachery because when (appellant) went to the house of the victim armed with a bolo looking for the latter who was not around, he had already the intention to kill him and said intention to kill was never abandoned as he waited for the arrival of the victim whom he saw along the road.&nbsp; There was treachery as the accused hacked the victim by the neck several times and the sudden and frontal attack on the forehead, thus causing his bones on the forehead to be exposed as shown in the medical certificate xxx.&nbsp; The exposure of the bones would only show that the hacking was therefore so strong enough as to insure his premeditated intention to kill the victim.<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing discussion, this Court believes that the prosecution was able to prove the guilt of the (appellant) beyond reasonable doubt. Pursuant to Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the Court hereby finds the (appellant) Juan Ganzagan, Jr., guilty of the crime of Murder and sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,<i> </i>considering the provisions of the 1987 Constitution (Art. III, Section 19(1)), and with all the accessory penalties provided by law; and to pay the civil liability of P50,000.00 to the heirs of the deceased; and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00, with costs.<br><br>"SO ORDERED." (Citations omitted)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Appellant now sets forth the following assigned errors:<br><blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT UPHOLDING SELF-DEFENSE AS A GROUND FOR ACQUITTAL OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS AT ALL GUILTY, THE TRIAL COURT NEVERTHELESS ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM FOR MURDER INSTEAD OF ONLY HOMICIDE CONSIDERING THAT NEITHER THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY NOR PREMEDITATION WAS DULY ESTABLISHED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.&nbsp; Appellant is not guilty of murder.<br><br>Appellant reiterates his reliance on the doctrine of self-defense to justify the killing of Servillano.&nbsp; He argues that he was able to prove all the elements of defense of self, namely: (1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>There are strong reasons to doubt the defense version of the facts that led to the killing of Servillano. The account of the Ganzaga spouses is inconsistent with the common experience and observation of mankind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Especially difficult to accept are the following assertions:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">(1)</div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">On the fateful afternoon of April 1, 1988, appellant was preparing <i>bilo-bilo </i>on the second floor of their house because he was looking after their <i>two-month-old </i>infant daughter.

Boniao</i></b>,<b> 217 SCRA 653 (1993)</b>:<b></b><br><br><blockquote></blockquote>"By invoking self-defense, the appellant admitted killing the four (4) victims.&nbsp; The burden is, therefore, upon him to prove the existence, by clear and convincing evidence, of its essential requisites xxx; otherwise stated, the <i>onus probandi </i>was thus shifted to him xxx.&nbsp; He must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution xxx, for even if the latter were weak, it could not be disbelieved after he himself admitted the killing xxx." (Citations omitted)<br><br>Thus, in claiming self-defense, appellant needs to convincingly establish that: (1) Servillano acted with unlawful aggression towards him; (2) the means he employed to repel such aggression was reasonable; and (3) he did not sufficiently provoke Servillano towards aggression.&nbsp; If appellant fails to discharge this burden of proof, his conviction shall of necessity follow, on the basis of his admission to the killing.<br><br>Unlawful aggression, which is an indispensable element of self-defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> is an assault or attack, or a threat thereof in an imminent and immediate manner, which places the accused's life in actual peril.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; It is an offensive act positively strong and determinative of the aggressor's intent to cause harm or injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; It presupposes a material attack which is impending or at the point of happening, and not merely an intimidating attitude or stance.<br><br>In the case at bench, appellant testified that after the initial bolo attack on him, he was able to take possession of the weapon and run away from Servillano.&nbsp; At that point, the unlawful aggression against him effectively ceased. When hostilities resumed five minutes later, appellant was the armed protagonist, and Servillano's act of trying to wrest the bolo back from him cannot be considered as unlawful aggression. Appellant no longer faced any imminent or immediate danger to his life and limb from his opponent.<br><br>There was no unlawful aggression by Servillano.&nbsp; Appellant had nothing to repel.&nbsp; Therefore, he cannot successfully posit the view that he was merely defending himself when he killed Servillano.<br><br>Parenthetically, appellant's claim of self-defense is further belied by the physical evidence in the case, specifically the number, location and severity of the hacked wounds found on Servillano.&nbsp; Dr. Gonzales found five (5) gaping wounds on Servillano's neck, running from the back of the head to the nape which exposed and severed the muscles, veins and arteries in the neck area. These indicate clearly that appellant's act was no longer one of self-preservation, "but a determined effort to kill his victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Appellant next postulates that even if self-defense were unavailable to him, he should only have been found guilty of committing homicide, and not murder.&nbsp; He claims that neither treachery nor evident premeditation, which are alleged in the Information, are present in the case at bench.<br><br>We are convinced.<br><br>The circumstances that qualify murder must be proven as indubitably as the killing itself.&nbsp; The presence of treachery<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and evident premeditation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> must not be deduced from mere presumption or sheer speculation.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the case at bench, that is exactly what the trial court did in concluding that both qualifying circumstances are present.<br><br>Article 14 (16) of the Revised Penal Code defines treachery thus:<br><br>"There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, <b><i>employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make</i></b>." (Italics ours.)<br><br>Its essence lies in the adoption of ways that minimize or neutralize any resistance which may be put up by the offended party.<br><br>In the present case, the prosecution failed to present any witness to testify as to the manner by which Servillano was attacked by appellant.&nbsp; Their sole eyewitness, Elino Manuel, only saw the actual hacking of the victim by appellant, and not the events that led to it.&nbsp; The records provide no basis for the trial court's finding of treachery.&nbsp; As we held in the case of <b><i>People v. Bachar</i></b><b>, 170 SCRA 700 </b><b>(1989)</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>:<b></b><br><br>"xxx Not a single eyewitness to the stabbing incident had been presented by the prosecution.&nbsp; Thus, the record is totally bereft of any evidence as to the means or method resorted to by appellant in attacking the victim. It is needless to add that treachery cannot be deduced from mere presumption, much less from sheer speculation. The same degree of proof to dispel reasonable doubt is required before any conclusion may be reached respecting the attendance of <i>alevosia</i>."<i></i><br><br>Evident premeditation suggests the deliberate hatching of a plan to execute a crime.&nbsp; Its elements are: (1) a previous decision by the accused to commit the crime; (2) an overt act/acts manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his determination; and (3) a lapse of time between the decision to commit the crime and its actual execution sufficient to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of his acts.<br><br>Time and again, we have held that evident premeditation cannot be appreciated to qualify a killing to murder in the absence of <b><i>direct</i></b> evidence of the planning and preparation to kill when the plan was conceived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bench, the prosecution failed to prove with any certainty that appellant had planned and prepared to kill Servillano previous to the fatal hacking.
