in CA-G.R. CV No. 15534 (<span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Atis</span>, Plaintiff-Appellant, versus Orlando <span class="SpellE">Delatina</span>, Defendant?<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>,
Spouses Arturo M. <span class="SpellE">Paculanang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Lilian</span>) <span class="SpellE">Bobes</span> <span class="SpellE">Paculanang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Intervenors-Appellees</span>),
dated 23 November 1989, affirming "in full" the Resolution dated 30
July 1987 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch X, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
City, which dismissed the case "for failure to exhaust administrative
remedies, under Presidential Decree No. 1067."<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The material allegations of the Complaint for "Judicial
Abatement of Nuisance, Mandatory Injunction and Damages," which the Trial
Court dismissed, read:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot 1 of the
plaintiff, together with Lots 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the persons named, have been
devoted primarily, directly and solely for fishpond purposes, the nature of the
realty being for these purposes as there is a natural <span style="">watercourse, stream, or continuous water between the banks;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since time
immemorial the water flows from these higher estates down to the sea of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> Bay, passing through a lower estate <span style="">claimed by one <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span>, the wife of
Arturo M. <span class="SpellE">Paculanang</span>, municipal trial judge of <span class="SpellE">Liloy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sindangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"6. The natural watercourse, since time immemorial, has been
freely flowing from the upper estates <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
unimpeded and continuously into the sea, through the land claimed by the said <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span> <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> <span class="SpellE">Bobis-Paculanang</span>, even as during high tide of the sea, sea
water also goes upwards into the fishpond of plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This condition has been by nature, existing
since time immemorial and all riparian or littoral estate owners have <span style="">recognized it, even as the public and
government authorities have also respected it;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"7. Sometime in the middle of August 1986, without plaintiff's
knowledge or permission, defendant closed the natural waterway by constructing
and building a dike on the land claimed by <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span> <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> <span class="SpellE">Bobis-Paculanang</span> thereby
completely blocking and obstructing the flow of the water from the higher
estate of plaintiff and his relatives, and thus causing the water in
plaintiff's fishpond to remain stagnant,<span style="">
and leading to the poisoning of plaintiff's growing shrimps, prawns, <span class="SpellE">bangus</span> (milkfish) and others to the great and irreparable
damage and injury to plaintiff;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When plaintiff knew and realized defendant's <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> acts, the effect of which was to create </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">nuisance, plaintiff readily confronted him and asked for an explanation
why he did that, when as a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain of San
Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City, defendant has always known of
the condition of the watercourse that freely empties its water into the sea,
and vice versa, the sea water also goes upwards during high tides, but
defendant merely said that he closed the <span class="SpellE">waterflow</span>
because he was making or constructing </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">dike for the fishpond
which he said, he </span>was <span style="">authorized
to make for Judge &amp; Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Paculanang</span>;"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 36-38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As prayed for in the Complaint and reiterated by Petitioner in
his Motion, dated 25 November 1986, the Trial Court issued, on 27 November
1986, a Temporary Mandatory Restraining Order which directed Respondent <span class="SpellE">Delatina</span> "to demolish or destroy immediately the dyke
he has constructed on the land of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span> <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span> <span class="SpellE">Paculanang</span> and restore the
condition of the water way prior to August, 1986, and to refrain from further
acts that may change the contour in the area surrounding Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Paculanang's</span> fishpond and the plaintiff's fishpond."</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, Respondent <span class="SpellE">Delatina</span> (now
deceased and substituted by his heirs) filed his Answer denying the material
allegations of the Complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Spouses Arturo and <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span> <span class="SpellE">Paculanang</span> filed an Answer-in-Intervention with
Counterclaim making common cause with Respondent <span class="SpellE">Delatina</span>,
which Answer the Trial Court admitted in an Order, dated <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="1">8 January 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> maintained among others:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant (<span class="SpellE">Delatina</span>) is a mere caretaker of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
in this case because the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> are the true
owners of the property in question;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the action for
nuisance by plaintiff is not actionable because the community is not affected,
as in fact the people around the area are happy with the construction of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> dike because they have utilized the same as
their bridge and pathway which they have not availed in the property of the
plaintiff;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the fishpond in
question is a titled property of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff's
complaint against defendant and/or <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> is
unfounded and not true <span style="">for </span>there
was never any moment that they have obstructed completely the free flow and
passage of water which may passed (sic) on their property because of the
construction of an irrigation dike and canal in their property, as shown in the
sketch plan hereto attached as Annex "1" of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
and made integral part of this answer;"<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In an Order bearing the same date, or on <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="1">8 January 1987</st1:date>, the Trial Court directed its Clerk
of Court, who was earlier designated as Commissioner, to supervise the drainage
experiment on the fishponds involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Report dated 13 April 1987, the Commissioner recommended
"the immediate demolition of all dykes, obstructions and the like
introduced in August, 1986 and thereafter by defendant <span class="SpellE">Delatina</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 June 1987, Respondent <span class="SpellE">Delatina</span>
filed a Motion to Dismiss the case on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the Trial Court has no jurisdiction over
the subject matter or nature of the action, the same being vested in the
National Water Resources Council by Pres. Decree No. 424;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and (2) Petitioner failed to exhaust
administrative remedies as no prior recourse was made to said Council.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on said Motion, the Trial Court dismissed the case on 30
July 1987, for Petitioner's "failure to exhaust administrative remedies
under Presidential Decree No. 1067."</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Court of Appeals, to which Petitioner appealed, affirmed
"in full" the Trial Court's order of dismissal, herein Petitioner
availed of this recourse claiming that the Court of Appeals erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in failing to consider the main issue
raised by the ultimate facts which is whether the acts of Private Respondents/<span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> caused damage or injury to the rights of
Petitioner, no "dispute as to water rights" being involved; (2) in
applying the general rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies, the instant
case being an exception thereto; and (3) in not ruling that Private
Respondents/<span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> could no longer question the
jurisdiction of the Trial Court after submitting to its jurisdiction and
seeking <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> from it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private Respondents/<span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span>, on the
other hand, have taken a contrary position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive issue pivots around whether or not, under the
material allegations of the Complaint, the case falls under the jurisdiction of
the Trial Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the Trial Court and the Court of Appeals
entertained a negative view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Courts
agreed with the Private Respondents/<span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> that
the case falls under the jurisdiction of the National Water Resources Council.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 1067 otherwise known as "The Water
Code of the Philippines" has spelled out in Article 3 thereof the
underlying principles of the Code, one of which is:</p>

<blockquote>"d. The utilization, exploitation, development, conservation and
protection of water resources shall be subject to the control and regulation of
the government through the National Water Resources Council, herein referred to
as the Council."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(underlining
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 88 of the same Code provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 88. The Council shall have <u>original</u> <u>jurisdiction</u>
<u>over</u> <u>all</u> <u>disputes</u> <u>relating</u> <u>to</u> <u>appropriation</u>,
<u>utilization</u>, <u>exploration</u>, <u>development</u>, <u>control</u>, <u>conservation</u>
<u>and</u> <u>protection</u> <u>of</u> <u>waters</u> <u>within</u> <u>the</u> <u>meaning</u>
<u>and</u> <u>context</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>Code</u>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underlining supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar does not involve any dispute relating to
appropriation or use of waters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>“Appropriation" as used in the Water Code means the
"acquisition of rights over the use of waters or the taking or diverting
of waters from a natural source" (Art. 9); while "use of water for
fisheries is the utilization of water for the propagation and culture of fish
as a commercial enterprise."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, Petitioner is the holder of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
WATER PERMIT NO. 10974 to use water from the San Pedro Creek, <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City, and (2) WATER PERMIT NO. 10975 to use sea
water, "for purposes of Fisheries," issued to him by no less than the
National Water Resources Council on January 4, 1988 (pp. 93 and 94, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issuance
of said permits served to grant petitioner water rights or the privilege to
appropriate and use water (Art. 13, Pres. Decree No. 1067) from the San Pedro
Creek and sea water from <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> Bay for his
fishpond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private Respondents/<span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> do not
dispute the water rights petitioner had acquired by reason of those permits but
maintain that said licenses were issued by the National Water Resources Council
to Petitioner only on 4 January 1988, or more than a year after the case was
filed in Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crucial point is,
however, that "since time immemorial" water had been flowing from the
higher estates down to <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> Bay and to the sea
passing through the lower estate belonging to the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the records before us <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> this statement of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, therefore, no dispute lies relative to the use or
appropriation by Petitioner of water from the San Pedro Creek and sea water
from the <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> Bay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case does not involve a determination of the parties’ respective
water rights, which would otherwise be within the competence and original
jurisdiction of the National Water Resources Council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the issue is whether or not the
construction of the dike, obstructed the natural water course or the free flow
of water from Petitioner's higher estate to <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span>'
lower estate thereby causing injury to petitioner's rights and impairing the
use of his fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This issue
necessitates resort to judicial intervention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Amistoso</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> (L-60219, 29 June 1984, 130 SCRA 228), where there is a
grant existing in favor of the petitioner, and there is a violation of
grantee's right by closure of irrigation canal, it is the enjoyment of the
right emanating from the grant that is in litigation, and the case is not
within the jurisdiction of the National Water Resources Council.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, it is the Regional Trial Court, Branch <u>X</u>, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City, and not the National Water Resources Council,
that has jurisdiction over the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies on
the basis of which the case was dismissed by both Courts below, does not come
into play.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals is SET
ASIDE and the case is ordered REMANDED to the Trial Court for further
proceedings, with costs against respondents/<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
