<p class="BODY"><span>Submitted for decision on June </span>13, 1979, <span>this 
is </span>a <span>petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the June 
</span>17, 1977 <span>Decision of the Court of First Instance of La Union, 
dismissing petitioner's petition for lack of merit; dissolving the writ of 
preliminary injunction of January 12, </span><span>1977; and ordering the remand 
of Criminal Case No. 534 to the Municipal Court for trial on the 
merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">A criminal complaint for theft was filed with the Municipal Court 
of San Fernando, La Union, presided over by respondent Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>, against Hank Schwartz, <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Schwartz and six (6) John Does, which complaint 
was docketed as Criminal Case No. 11244.<span>&nbsp; </span>The herein petitioner was 
the complainant in the said case, she, being the owner of the stolen personal 
properties worth P9<span class="GramE">,880.00</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Municipal Court, after conducting a preliminary investigation, 
issued a warrant of arrest against Hank Schwartz and <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Schwartz.The six (6) John Does were not 
<span>identified by the prosecution witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the Municipal Court, acting on a written waiver of 
the second stage of preliminary investigation filed by counsel for the two (2) 
identified accused (Hank Schwartz and <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> 
Schwartz), in an Order dated October 5, 1976 (Record, p. 31), forwarded the case 
to the Court of First Instance of La Union <span>(where it was docketed as 
Criminal Case No. 534) for trial on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On October 18, 1976, after the Clerk of Court of the Court 
of First Instance of La Union had transmitted the records of the case to the 
Provincial Fiscal of La Union, herein petitioner Virginia B. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span> wrote a letter to the Provincial Fiscal, giving the 
names of the John Does mentioned in the complaint and stating that there were 
seven (7) of them instead of <span>six (6); </span>and she also asked that the 
date for the investigation of her witnesses who know the names of the John Does 
be set and thereafter the corresponding amendment of the information be 
made.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 
32).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="11" day="6" year="1976">November 6, 
1976</st1:date>, First Assistant Provincial Fiscal Francisco M. <span class="SpellE">Tejano</span> issued an Order for the preliminary investigation of 
the seven (7) other accused, previously referred to as John Does 
(<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 33).<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="11" day="15" year="1976">November 15, 1976</st1:date>, another Order was issued requiring the 
said accused to submit their counter-affidavits within ten (10) days from 
receipt of the said order (<em>Ibid.</em>, p. <span>34).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>However, while the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office 
was still conducting its preliminary inv</span>e<span>stigation, the seven (7) 
accused, the herein private respondents, voluntarily surrendered to respondent 
Municipal Judge, who issued an Order dated November 19, 1976, setting the case 
(Criminal Case No. 11244) for the second stage of preliminary investigation 
insofar as the said accused were concerned.<span>&nbsp; </span>Informed of the said 
Order of </span><st1:date month="11" day="19" year="1976"><span>November 19, 
1976</span></st1:date><span>, petitioner questioned the propriety of the said 
order in a letter sent to the respondent Municipal Judge (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 
37-38).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on <st1:date month="11" day="22" year="1976">November 22, 1976</st1:date>, respondent Municipal Judge issued 
another Order directing the Station Commander of <st1:city><st1:place>San 
Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union, <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> M. 
<span class="SpellE">Leonen</span>, to amend the original complaint by including 
the names of the seven (7) accused who surrendered (<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 
36).<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Pursuant to the said Order, Station Commander <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Leonen</span> amended the 
complaint by including the names of the seven (7) other accused (<em>Ibid.</em>, 
pp. 39-40).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Herein petitioner Virginia B. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span> then brought a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, 
Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i>, with prayer for writ of preliminary 
</span><span>injunction, </span><span>with the Court of First 
</span><span>Instance </span><span>of La Union, presided over by respondent 
Judge Angel A. <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span>, seeking, among other things 
the nullification of the November 19 and 22, 1976 Orders of respondent Municipal 
Court, as well as the amended complaint filed by the Station Commander 
(<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 25-30).<span>&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case 
No. 2754.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="11" year="1977">January 11, 
1977</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance of La Union granted the writ of 
preliminary injunction prayed for by petitioner and enjoined respondent 
Municipal Judge from conducting the preliminary investigation he set for 
<st1:date month="1" day="13" year="1977">January 13, 1977</st1:date> (p. 3, June 
17, 1977 Decision; Record, p. 61).</p>
<p class="BODY">In the said Civil Case No. 2754, public respondents filed separate 
Motions to Dismiss (pp. 3-4, <span class="GramE"><em>Ibid.</em>;</span> Record, 
pp. 61-62) while private respondents filed an Answer and Counterclaim with 
Motion to Remand (Record, pp. 41-46).<span>&nbsp; </span>These were opposed by 
petitioner by filing a Reply and Opposition (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 47-50).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The Provincial Fiscal, on the other hand, in compliance with the Order of 
the Court dated January 31, 1977, filed a Manifestation on February 11, 1977 
stating (1) that it is the position of the public prosecution that the 
respondent court can <span>validly conduct the second stage of the preliminary 
investigation to</span><span> </span><span>determine the identity and 
participation of the private respondents who have not waived their rights; and 
(2) that the public prosecution has chosen as a forum the Court of First 
Instance to which the municipal court had elevated the records of Criminal Case 
No. 11244.<span>&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the motions to dismiss having been denied 
by the Court, public respondents filed their Answer (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 
51-54).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">After hearing on the merits, the <span>Court </span>of First 
Instance of La Union rendered a ruling (decision), dated June 17, 1977, 
dismissing the petition; dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction of 
January 12, 1977; and ordering the remand of Criminal Case No. 534 to the 
Municipal Court for trial on the merits (Record, pp. 59-69).</p>
<p class="BODY">A Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision was filed by 
petitioner on <st1:date month="8" day="20" year="1977">August 20, 
1977</st1:date> (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 70-74), but the same was denied on 
<st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1977">August 22, 1977</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Hence, this petition (<span class="GramE"><em>Ibid.</em>,</span> pp. 14-24).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Private respondents, in compliance with the resolution of 
<st1:date month="1" day="4" year="1978">January 4, 1978</st1:date> of the First 
Division of this Court (<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 75) filed their Comment on <st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1978">February 14, 1978</st1:date> (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 
89-90), while the Solicitor General filed his Comment on <st1:date month="7" day="14" year="1978">July 14, 1978</st1:date> (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 125-137).</p>
<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated <st1:date month="7" day="19" year="1978">July 19, 1978</st1:date>, the First Division of this Court resolved, 
among others, to give due course to the petition; and to require the parties to 
submit simultaneous memoranda within thirty (30) days from notice thereof 
(<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 139).<span>&nbsp; </span>In compliance therewith, petitioner 
filed her Memorandum on <st1:date month="9" day="27" year="1978">September 27, 
1978</st1:date> (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 149-158).</p>
<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated <st1:date month="6" day="13" year="1979">June 13, 1979</st1:date>, the First Division of this Court resolved 
to deny the motions of the Solicitor General for nineteenth, twentieth and 
twenty first extensions of time <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> thirty (30) 
days from <st1:date month="5" day="16" year="1979">May 16, 1979</st1:date> 
within which to file memorandum; and to declare the case submitted for decision 
(<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 293).</p>
<p class="BODY">The issues in this case <span class="GramE">are<span>&nbsp; 
</span>—</span></p>
<ol><li><span></span>WHETHER OR NOT THE MUNICIPAL COURT HAS AUTHORITY TO RECALL THE 
RECORDS OF CRIMINAL CASE NO. 11244 IN ORDER TO CONDUCT A SECOND STAGE OF 
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION, AFTER SAID CASE HAS BEEN ELEVATED TO THE COURT OF 
FIRST INSTANCE AND THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL IS ALREADY CONDUCTING THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE IDENTITIES AND PARTICIPATION OF 
THE "JOHN DOES" UPON THE REQUEST OF 
COMPLAINANT;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE CAN DISREGARD THE CHOICE OF FORUM 
MADE BY THE INVESTIGATING FISCAL FOR THE TRIAL OF THE CASE ON THE MERITS; 
and<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE CAN REMAND THE CASE TO THE 
MUNICIPAL COURT FOR TRIAL ON THE MERITS.</li></ol>
<p class="BODY">The instant petition is without merit.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that a complaint for theft of personal properties 
worth P9<span class="GramE">,880.00</span>, allegedly committed in San Fernando, 
La Union, was filed with the Municipal Court of San Fernando and docketed 
therein as Criminal Case No. 11244.<span>&nbsp; </span>Under the provisions of 
Section 87 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, in relation to 
<span>Article 309(2) of the Revised Penal Code, the Municipal Court of San 
Fernando and the Court of First Instance of La Union have concurrent 
jurisdiction over the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">As <span>stated by Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in 
his concurring opinion, whenever a criminal complaint is filed in an inferior 
court charging an offense within its concurrent jurisdiction with the court of 
first instance, said inferior court should as a rule refrain from assuming 
jurisdiction solely to conduct a preliminary examination and investigation and 
should instead take cognizance thereof already for trial on the merits after 
conducting the preliminary examination (<span class="SpellE"><em>Tabil</em></span><em> v. Ong</em>, 91 SCRA 451, July 16, 
1979).<span>&nbsp; </span>This principle is based on well-settled jurisprudence that 
the accused in an offense falling within the concurrent jurisdiction of the 
Inferior Courts and Courts of First <span class="GramE">Instance,</span> is not 
entitled to </span><span>be </span><span>heard in a preliminary 
investigation.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>People v. Pable</em>, 115 
SCRA 707-708; July 30, 1982; <em>People v. Abejuela</em> and <em>People vs. 
Endan</em>, 38 SCRA 324; March 31, 1971).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The reason is 
that the ensuing trial on the merits takes place of the preliminary 
investigation, without needless waste of duplication of time and effort.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Tabil</em></span><em> v. Ong, 
supra</em>).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, pursuant to the doctrine laid down in 
said cases, the Municipal Court of San Fernando should have tried the case on 
the merits.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, however, respondent Municipal Judge 
erroneously elevated the case to the Court of First Instance of La Union for 
trial on the merits, and because of this error, petitioner now contends that the 
Municipal Court of San Fernando has lost its jurisdiction over the case, and 
accordingly, it is deprived of the authority to order the amendment of the 
criminal complaint and to conduct the second stage of preliminary 
investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">This contention is untenable as it is likewise well-settled that 
upon filing of the case, the Municipal Court acquired jurisdiction over it to 
the exclusion of the Court of First Instance, (<em>People v. Pable, supra</em>); 
that the court which first acquires jurisdiction of a case retains it to the 
exclusion of the other courts (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Layno</span>, 111 
SCRA 20; <span class="SpellE"><em>Encarnacion</em></span><em> vs. Baltazar and 
Kayanan</em>, 111 Phil. 459) and that jurisdiction once acquired subsists until 
the case is completely decided (<span class="SpellE"><em>Roxas</em></span><em> vs. 
Sayoc</em>, 100 Phil. 448; <span class="SpellE"><em>Tomasa</em></span><em> C. 
Viuda de Pamintuan vs. Tiglao</em>, 53 Phil. 1, 4).</p>
<p class="BODY">It has also been held that mere transmittal of the records of 
criminal cases to the Court of First Instance without the filing of the 
corresponding information, does not vest jurisdiction in said court.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Salcedo</em></span><em> v. 
Suarez</em>, 80 SCRA 242; Oct. 28, 1977; <span class="SpellE"><em>Quinto</em></span><em> v. Villaluz</em>, 113 SCRA 180, March 
29, 1982).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the instant case while the Provincial Fiscal has expressed 
preference for the Court of First Instance of La Union as the forum for the 
trial of the case on the merits, no information has as yet been filed by him 
while as previously stated the Municipal Court of San Fernando has already 
acquired jurisdiction over the criminal case upon filing of the complaint 
therein by Station Commander <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Leonen</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">There appears no need to resolve the third issue, it being evident 
from the foregoing that the Court of First Instance of La Union did not err in 
remanding the case to the Municipal Court of San Fernando for trial on the 
merits.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the Court RESOLVED to AFFIRM the 
assailed decision.</p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>, 
Gutierrez, Jr., Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Bidin</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Cortes, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span>
