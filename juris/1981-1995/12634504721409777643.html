				<BR><STRONG>MAKASIAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This refers to a verified complaint (pp. 2-4, rec.) dated May 24,
1977, filed with this Court by Spouses Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>
and Carmen T. <span class="SpellE">Galan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span>
City, charging respondent District Judge <span class="SpellE">Dimalanes</span> B.
<span class="SpellE">Buissan</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, Branch III, with station at <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City, with alleged violation of constitutional
rights and gross ignorance of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainants alleged that on May 20, 1976, the City Fiscal of
<span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> filed against them in respondent's court
Criminal Case No. 1617, for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>, wherein the sum
of P1,000.00 was recommended as bail for each of them (Annex "A");
that on June 16, 1976, the respondent knowingly signed the Order of Arrest to
be served at San Carlos City, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental,
without stating the amount of bail; that on September 20, 1976, the Order of Arrest
was forwarded to San Carlos City (Annexes "B" and "C");
that on October 13, 1976, they were arrested by the San Carlos City Police and
detained thereat (Annex "D"); that on October 14, 1976, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span>, Station Commander of San Carlos, wired the Clerk
of Court of First Instance and the respondent inquiring as to the amount of
bail and whether they (accused and herein complainants) can put up their bond
in San Carlos City (Annexes "E" and "F"); that when no
reply was forthcoming, they wired Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tomboc</span>
(brother of complainant Carmen T. <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>) who is
residing at <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City to inquire personally as to
the amount of their bail (Annex "G"); that on October 18, 1976,
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tomboc</span> deposited with the office of the clerk
of court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, the cash bond of
P2,000.00 (Annex "H") and they were finally released from the San
Carlos City Jail on October 19, 1977 at 10:20 A.M. (Annexes "H" and
"I"); that they were detained in the San Carlos City Jail without
bail from 11:20 A.M. on October 13, 1976 up to 10:20 A.M. of October 19, 1976
as certified to by the San Carlos Police Lieutenant (Annex "J"); and
that on January 31, 1977, the said Criminal Case No. 1617, for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>, was dismissed when Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, the offended party, withdrew his complaint
(Annex "K").</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainants submit that based on the <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>
facts which are supported by documentary <span class="GramE">evidence,</span> it
is beyond doubt that herein respondent violated the provision of Section 18,
Article IV, of the Constitution, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"All persons except those charged with capital offense when
the evidence of guilt is strong shall before conviction be <span class="SpellE">bailable</span>
by sufficient sureties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Excessive bail
shall not be required."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is also complainants' further submission that the respondent
is guilty of gross ignorance of the law when he knowingly failed to recommend
the amount of bail when the warrant of arrest was to be served at <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, thus, outside of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte and for his (respondent) <span style="">failure
</span><span style="">to authorize the Municipal or
City Judge of San Carlos City or the Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental to accept the bail as provided for under
Section 7 of Rule 112, Rules of Court, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Admission to bail when warrant of arrest
occurs outside of the jurisdiction of the court</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Upon issuing the order of arrest, the Judge
shall ascertain whether the defendant is within or without his
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of the latter, he
shall issue an order fixing the amount thereof, and authorizing any Municipal
Judge or Judge of First Instance where the defendant may be found to accept
such bail."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his comment embodied
in his 2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorse­ment</span> (pp. 28-31, rec.) dated </span><st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="8"><span style="">August 9,
 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, the respondent
averred that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1. <span class="GramE">The</span> antecedent facts as gathered
by the undersigned from reliable sources are as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“(<span class="GramE">a</span>) Mr. and Mrs. Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>, prior to the filing of Criminal Case No. 1617, were
residents of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, doing their regular business
in this City and <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">“(b) Mr. and Mrs. Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>, upon
failure to pay their obligations to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> and upon learning that probable court action was
contemplated against them left <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City and went <span style="">allegedly to </span><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>
but later were traced by private <span style="">prosecutor
to San Carlos City;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">"(c) That a warrant or arrest, Annex 'A', was prepared by
Acting Branch Clerk of Court Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> and
placed on my table for my signature which, as a routine matter, <span style="">was immediately signed by me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances and reasons why the amount
of bail bond was not placed on the warrant is detailed by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> in his affidavit hereto attached as Annex 'B.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“2. That when I signed the warrant of arrest, I overlooked the fact
that the warrant was to be directly served outside the province of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, believing honestly that the said
warrant was to be served within the jurisdiction of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
the oversight on my part was an honest, unintentional mistake, which any person
may commit unknowingly;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. <span style="">That as detailed in </span>Annex
'B' by Clerk of Court Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>, no unnecessary
delay, other than the time required for telegraphic communications, was caused
to the<span style=""> complainants;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"5. That the arrest and detention of an accused is a necessary
consequence of their violation of the law, and even if the amount of bail was
placed on the warrant, necessarily the accused will be detained until they can
file their bail bond with the court and their release ordered, or even if the
warrant was served within the jurisdiction of this Court, still the accused
will be detained pending preparation and filing of their bail bond;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">xx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent further
stated that as shown in the record of the case, Clerk of Court <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>, upon learning of the arrest of complainants in </span>San
Carlos City, sent on October 18, 1976 a telegram (Annex "E") to the
Provincial Commander for PC escort for the accused to <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
City although he has no prior knowledge of such step taken by Branch Clerk of
Court <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>; that said telegram was, however, not
transmitted as on said date (October 18), Mr. and Mrs. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tomboc</span> filed cash bond for the accused as certified to by
Clerk of Court <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span>
(Annex "F"); that on same date (October 18), he <i>[</i>respondent<i>]</i>
signed an order of release (Annex "G"); and that on October 18, 1976,
Clerk of Court <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> sent a telegram to the Chief of
Police of San Carlos City requesting the release of the complainants (Annex
"H").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent reiterated
that he did not notice that the warrant of arrest he signed on June 16, 1976
was to be directly served outside the territorial jurisdiction of his Court;
that </span>the error was one of oversight, unintentional, without malice and
without any intention to prejudice the right of the accused; that said error
could have been committed by even a more meticulous and careful person and it
could happen to anyone; and that as explained by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>
in his affidavit <span style="">marked as Annex
"B", the employees of the Court usually prepare the warrants of
arrest without stating the amount of the bail bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the respondent
averred that the filing of the instant complaint was masterminded by former
Judge <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> de Guzman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the First Division, in its resolution dated
<st1:date year="1978" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1978</st1:date>, resolved to
refer this case to the Court <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>, it appearing that the
respondent Judge has a pending application for compulsory retirement for having
reached the age of 65 in February, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records further revealed that the respondent filed a
manifestation dated <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1980</st1:date>,
the contents of which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In connection with respondent's claim that the above-entitled
case (referring to the instant Administrative Matter No. 1648-CFI) was
masterminded by former Judge <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> de Guzman, respondent
herewith submits the affidavit of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Mejorada</span>, one of the well-known lawyers in this province,
as proof of respondent's claim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the attached carbon and <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> <span class="GramE">copies of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mejorada's</span> affidavit is</span>
respectfully submitted as part of respondent's pleading in this case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a review of the entire records, there is no basis to the
charge that respondent violated com<span style="">plainants'
right to bail as provided for in the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no dispute that
herein complainants were released from the San Carlos City Jail at 10:20 A.M.
on October 19, 1976 based on the release </span>order issued by the respondent
on October 18 after Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tomboc</span> (brother of
complainant Carmen T. <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>) filed a cash bond of
P2,000.00 for their (complainants) provisional liberty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only charge which deserves consideration is respondent's
admitted failure to indicate the amount of bail bond in the warrant of arrest
he issued against herein complainants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such failure to do so was candidly admitted by the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he explained that such error was only the
result of an oversight and an honest and unintentional mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">There</span> is also no
showing that respondent in committing such mistake was motivated by malice or
ill will against herein complainants nor was it the result of a deliberate
intent to commit an injustice against the said accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, respondent's omission should be visited
with an admonition only.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, RESPONDENT DISTRICT JUDGE DIMALANES B. BUISSAN
IS HEREBY ADMONISHED TO BE MORE CAREFUL AND CIRCUMSPECT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF
HIS JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS, WITH A WARNING THAT A REPETITION OF THE SAME OR SIMILAR
INFRACTION WILL BE DEALT WITH MORE SEVERELY.</p>

RECORD.</p>
