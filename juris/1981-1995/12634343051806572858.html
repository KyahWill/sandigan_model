Case No. FI-310-86 affirming the orders of public respondent Henry Parel dated
2 March 1987 and 7 August 1987 which, respectively, directed petitioner to pay
the eighty-six (86) complainants in said case the sum of Eight Hundred Eighty
Seven Thousand Seven Hundred Nineteen Pesos and Fifty Two Centavos (P887,719.52)

a complaint for non­payment/underpayment of wages, living allowances, 13th
month pay </span>and service incentive leave pay.  As stated in the Order of 2 March 1987, each of the 86
complainants was entitled to the aggregate amount of P10,322.35.  Such figure was arrived at solely on the
basis of the affidavits submitted by the complainants following an inspection
conducted on 11 November 1986 by the labor standards and welfare officers of
Regional Office No. VI of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE.)
because the payrolls and daily time records were not allegedly presented by
herein petitioner, as respondent therein; petitioner had claimed that she

the contention that granting for the sake of argument that the Department of
Labor and Employment has jurisdiction over the claims in question, the order
would still be void because she was not given an opportunity to be heard,
thereby being deprived of due process.</p>

ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The power then of the Regional Director (under the present
state of the law) to adjudicate employees' money claims is subject to the
concurrence of all the requisites provided under Sec. 2 of RA 6715, to
wit:  (1) the claim is presented by an
employee or person employed in domestic or household service, or househelper;
(2) the claim arises from employer-employee relations; (3) the claimant does
not seek reinstatement; and (4) the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">aggregate
</span>money claim of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">each </span></i>employee
or househelper does not exceed P5,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Going over the records of this case, we note that the aggregate
claims of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">each </span></i>of the fifty
four (54) employees of herein petitioner are over and above the amount of
P5,000.00.  Under the circumstances, the
power to adjudicate such claims belongs to the Labor Arbiter who has the
exclusive jurisdiction over employees' claims where the aggregate amount of the
claim for <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">each </span></i>employee
exceeds P5,000.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Amplifying
further on the matter, We held in the Resolution 5 June 1991</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Labor Code leads the Court to reiterate its ruling that the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">exclusive </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">jurisdiction </span>to hear and decide employees' claims arising from
employer-employee relations, exceeding the aggregate amount of P5,000.00 for
each employee, is vested in the Labor Arbiter (Article 217 (a)(6).  This <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">exclusive </span></i>jurisdic­tion of the Labor Arbiter is confirmed by
the provisions of Article 129 which <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">excludes
</span></i>from the jurisdiction of the Regional Director or any hearing
officer of the Department of Labor the power to hear and decide claims of
employees arising from employer-employee relations exceeding the amount of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">P5,000.00 </span>for each employee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To construe the visitorial power of the Secretary of Labor to order
and enforce compliance with labor laws as including the power to hear and
decide <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">cases </span></i>involving
employees' claims for wages, arising from employer-employee relations, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">even </span></i>if the amount of said claims
exceed (sic) P5,000.00 for each employee, would, in our considered opinion,
emasculate and render meaningless, if not useless, the provisions of Article
217 (a)(6) and Article 129 of the Labor Code which, as above-pointed out,
confer <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">exclusive </span></i>jurisdiction
on the Labor Arbiter to hear and decide such employees' claims (exceeding
P5,000.00 for each employee).  To
sustain the respondents' position would, in effect sanction a situation where
all employees claims, regardless of amount, can be heard and determined by the
Secretary of Labor under his visitorial power.  This does not, however appear to be the legislative intent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We further hold that to <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">harmonize</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the </span>above-quoted three <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(a) </span>provisions of the Labor Code, the
Secretary of Labor should be held as possessed of his plenary visitorial powers
to order the inspection of all establishment where labor is employed, to look
into all possible violations of labor laws and regulations but the power to
hear and decide employees' claims exceeding P5,000.00 for each employee should
be left to the Labor Arbiter as the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">exclusive
repository </span></i>of the power to hear and decide such claims.  In other words, the inspection conducted by
the Secretary of Labor, through labor regulation officers or industrial safety
engineers, may yield findings of violations of labor standards under labor
laws; the Secretary of Labor may order compliance with said labor standards, if<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> necessary, through appropriate writs of
execution but when the findings disclose an employee claim of over P5,000.00,
the matter should be referred to the Labor Arbiter in recognition of his </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">exclusive </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">jurisdiction over such claims.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Nor is this position devoid of sound reason or purpose, because -?</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->  The proceedings before
the Secretary of Labor (or his agents) exercising his visitorial powers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is <i>summary in nature.  </i></span>On the other hand, proceedings
before the Labor Arbiters are more formal and in accord with rules of
evidence.  When the employee's claim is
less than P5,000.00, a summary procedure for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">its </span>settlement can be justified, but not when a claim is more or
less substantial, from the standpoint of both employee and management, for
which reason, an employee's claim exceeding P5,000.00 is placed within the <i>exclusive
</i>jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter to hear and decide.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->  Article 129 of the
Labor Code expressly provides that <i>'upon complaint of any interested party,'
</i>the Regional Director (and, consequently, the Secretary of Labor to whom
appeals from the Regional Director are taken) is empowered to hear and decide
simple money claims, i.e., those that do not exceed P5,000.00 for each
employee, employing for this purpose a summary procedure.  If Article 128 (b) of the Labor Code were to
be construed as empowering the Secretary of Labor, under his visitorial power,
to hear and decide all types of employee's claims, <i>including those exceeding
P5,000.00 for each employee, </i>employing for this purpose a summary
procedure, then, Article 129  (limiting
the Regional Director's jurisdiction to a claim <i>not </i>exceeding P5,000.00)
becomes a useless  surplusage in the
Labor Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->  Besides, it would seem
that as the law (Article 129) limits the jurisdiction of the Regional Director
(and, therefore, the Secretary of Labor on appeal from the Regional Director)
to ‘complaints of any interested party' seeking an amount of not more than
P5,000.00, for each employee, it cannot be that, because of the absence of any
complaint from any interested party, the Secretary of Labor under his
visitorial power, is <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motu proprio </span></i>empowered
to hear and decide employee's claim of more than P5,000.00 for each employee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition to all the foregoing, the Court cannot overlook the
fact that petitioner <i>contests </i>the findings of the labor regulation
officer, upon which, the respondents based their questioned orders.  Nor can it be argued with persuasion that
the issues raised by petitioner are not evidentiary in nature and unverifiable
in the course of inspection.  Moreover,
the total amount of the respondents' award against petitioner, is P964,952.50
(with the award for each of the fifty four (54) employees involved not being
less than P5,000.00).  The total award
of P964,952.50 is a tidy sum sufficient to knock-off any viable enterprise.  What <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is
</span>worse is that all this is done through summary proceedings.</blockquote>
