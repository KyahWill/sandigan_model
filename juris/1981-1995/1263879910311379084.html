<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>facts follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 8, 1983, at about 11:00 o'clock a.m., Rowena Permison,
then six (6) years old, was on her way home from her kindergarten class at
Bantayan Elementary School, Mangaldan, Pangasinan when she was accosted by the
appellant who told her "Come here and I will have sexual intercourse with
you" (t.s.n., pp. 6 and 9, August 30, 1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On hearing the appellant's remarks, Rowena <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">tried </span>to run away from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant who is Rowena's uncle, being
the brother of her father, chased Rowena and after getting hold of her, dragged
her to a nearby bamboo grove where he removed her panty and his pants, and
inserted his penis into her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rowena felt pain in her vagina and something hot came out from the
appellant's penis (t.s.n., pp. 6-10, <u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, the appellant whipped Rowena with
a stick and sent her away with a warning <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">not
</span>to report the matter to her mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rowena went home crying and immediately reported the matter to her
mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On </span>the other hand,
the evidence for the defense tends to show that on July 8, 1983, the appellant
was at home taking care of his nine-month old child as his wife was washing
their clothes; that in the afternoon of the same day, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

charge but Belinda had left for awhile; that he waited for Belinda until 6:00

he was again summoned by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Barangay </span>Captain
on complaint of Belinda that he raped Rowena on July 8<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Corroborating the appellant's testimony, the Barangay Captain
confirmed that on July 8, 1983, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only
</span>complaint of Belinda was that the appellant whipped Rowena when the
latter came home from school; that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>confronted
the appellant who denied whipping Rowena but Belinda did not return anymore;
that it was on the following day when Belinda told him that Rowena was abused
by the appellant; that he again summoned the appellant who appeared before him
but Belinda, who had left as before, did not return anymore, and so he again
sent the appellant home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(T.s.n., pp. 201-209, March 16, 1987).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Cipriano Biala, whose land adjoins the school site in Bantayan
and is traversed by the pathway, testified that he worked on his land the whole
day of July 8, 1983; that he saw Rowena and her twin brothers on their way to
school and on their way back at about 10:00 o'clock in the morning; and that
nothing untoward happened to them. (T.s.n., pp. 4-10, September 21, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">Two other neighbors, Menardo Caballero and Alfonso Gonzales,
testified that they saw the children of Belinda going to and from the school on
July 8, 1983 but that nothing unusual happened when they passed by.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(T.s.n., pp. 12-15,

<p class="BODY">Lucrecia Abrigo, the teacher of Rowena (T.s.n., pp. 3-4, January
23, 1989), testified that neither Rowena nor her <span class="GramE">mother</span>
complained to her of any act committed against Rowena, nor was she notified of
any complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp.
4-5, <u>Id</u>.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">On </span>April 24, 1989,
the trial court rendered judgment, the decretal portion reading as follows -</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the accused Jose Permison is found guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, defined and penalized under Article <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">335 (3) </span>of the Revised Penal Code and
hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <u>Reclusion</u> <u>Perpetua</u>,
to indemnify the offended party, Rowena Permison, the amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral damages and to pay the costs." (p. 31,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the appellant assigns the following as errors:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in
finding the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt notwithstanding the fact
that the testimony of the alleged victim Rowena is not only uncorroborated but
is inconsistent with human experience and behavior;</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>not considering the fact that the
alleged victim's mother Belinda had sufficient motive to falsely charge the
appellant with rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>not believing the testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the appellant as corroborated by his
witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall discuss the errors together as they all hinge on the
issue of credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The quantum of evidence required to sustain a conviction for rape
supported by the lone testimony of the complainant has been laid down <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The rule is, a judgment of conviction for the crime of rape
cannot be based on the testimony of the offended party alone unless such
testimony is clear, positive, and convincing, or supported by other undisputed
facts and strong circumstantial evidence disclosed by the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. Poblador 76 SCRA
634).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In People v. Lacuna, 87

<blockquote>‘x x x <span class="GramE">In</span> a rape case, the uncorroborated
testimony of the offended party may be sufficient under certain circumstances
to warrant conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But for this rule
to <span class="GramE">obtain,</span> the lone testimony of the woman victim must
be clear and free from any serious contradiction, her story must be impeccable
and must ring (true) throughout or bear the stamp of absolute truth and candor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Royeras, 130 SCRA 250)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We fully realize that
Rowena was of very tender age at the time of the alleged incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her minority, however, does not necessarily
lend credence to her complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Numerous
<span class="GramE">circumstances,</span> detract from the credibility of
Rowena's version of what happened at about noon of July 8, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the trial, she testified -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is possible, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If that object (referring

condition of that part of Rowena Permison?</blockquote>

the vagina of the child is very small, sir.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since there is nothing in the medico-legal findings that would support
Rowena's claim of rape, her mother, Belinda, in her bid to show that
intercourse had taken place, introduced Rowena's panty which contained about 2
cc. mucoid like material with reddish streaks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The said mucoid like material, however, which was subjected <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>laboratory <span class="GramE">analysis</span>

<p class="BODY">While this Court has, in numerous cases affirmed the judgments of
conviction rendered by the trial court in rape charges especially where the
offended parties were very young and presumptively had no ill motives to
concoct a story if only to secure indictments for a crime as grave as rape, this
Court likewise reversed judgments of conviction and acquitted the accused when
there were strong indications pointing to the possibility that the rape charges
were merely motivated by some factors except the truth as to their commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, Rowena's mother who filed the <span class="GramE">complaint,</span> has strong motives to falsely charge the
appellant because there is bad blood between her and the appellant and his
wife, beginning a few months before the alleged incident, and continuing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had a quarrel and the appellant
threatened to kill her.</p>
