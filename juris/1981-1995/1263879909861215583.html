William See Chi, owner of the <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span> Variety Mart,
located at <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
Metro Manila, where the crime took place, testified that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On July 27, 1980 at about 10:00 o'clock in
the evening, she was at the aforesaid store together with her husband, William,
their two children and two housemaids, <span class="SpellE">Criselda</span> <span class="SpellE">Oca</span> and Susana <span class="SpellE">Tonido</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that particular time, accused Rolando <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> whom she positively identified in open court, then
carrying a shoulder bag, arrived at the store ordered a piece of bread and a
bottle of soft drink, which he consumed slowly, eliciting suspicion that he was
waiting for a companion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He refused to
enter the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes
thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Maranion's</span> companion Patrolman Antonio
Benito, arrived at the store, entered the same and announced a hold-up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that precise moment, <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>
helped Benito close the door of the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pat. Benito poked his gun at Margarita and dragged her to the room
inside the store where the two housemaids, <span class="SpellE">Criselda</span>
and Susana, were.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the door of the
said room was opened, Margarita was pushed inside and together with the two
maids, were ordered to lie flat facing the floor, and then the door was
closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moments after, successive
gunshots were heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After waiting for a
while, Margarita crawled out of the room and thereupon she saw the lifeless
body of her husband, William bathed in his own blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cash in the amount of P6,000.00 in the
victim's wallet was gone, the store was widely open, and another victim, <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> de la Cruz, a regular customer, was also sprawled on
the ground outside the store, with relatives crying around his body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police later took her statement and took
some pictures of the store premises and one of the victims of the robbery-slay
incident (Exhibits "A" to "A-2" and "B" to
"B-3", Records, pp. 360-62 and pp. 347-49; TSN, Vol. I, pp. 2-3;

<p class="BODY"><u>Susana</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Tonido</u></span>, a
housemaid of the spouses William and Margarita See Chi, corroborated the
testimony of the latter as to the identity and the presence of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>, before and during the progress of the robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She declared that she was about to close the
store that night of <st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1980</st1:date>,
when accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> arrived at the store
and ordered some snacks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also
testified that said accused was still at the store counter when the robbery was
in progress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Vol. III, pp. 25-32,
Hearing of May 18, 1983).</p>

accompanied their preacher in taking a ride.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

de la Cruz, on his way to <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span> Variety Mart to
have his money changed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said that
the place was then properly lighted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
declared that she saw her father reach the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Minutes later, she heard successive gunshots
coming from the direction of the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She saw two men running away from the said store and heading for the
main road towards a taxi parked at a gasoline station, which was about 15 to 20
meters away from the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tall man
was carrying a gun while his companion, whom she later identified as Rolando <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>, was carrying something she wasn't sure what it
was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also noticed that the taxi at
the gasoline station drove towards the two aforesaid men, and after the two
boarded the same, it immediately sped away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She also identified the taxi driver as <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Regudo</span>, whom she saw twice, once when going to the
main road and then upon her returning home (TSN, Vol. II pp. 17-21, Hearing of <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1983</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Sgt.</u> <u>Antonio</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Sityar</u></span>

his Station Commander on <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1980</st1:date>
to take the extrajudicial confession of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He advised Rolando <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>
of his constitutional rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of the investigation, <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> identified his
co-accused Pat. Antonio Benito from the file of photographs of the police (TSN,
Vol. VI, pp. 58-77, Hearing of September 23, 1985).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Ester</u> <u>de</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u>, widow of <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> de la Cruz, declared that prior to her husband's
death, the latter had been earning about P1,500/month, accepting typing jobs,
and that she spent P15,000.00 as burial expenses for her deceased husband (TSN,
Vol. VIII, pp. 86-87, Hearing of January 14, 1986).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Dr.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bienvenido</u></span> <u>Munoz</u>,
Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), testified
that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On July 28, 1980, he conducted the
<u>post-mortem</u> examination on the body of William See Chi and prepared the
autopsy report (Exhibit "F", Records, p. 356); that the cause of
death is due to gunshot wounds at the back of the deceased victim; and that
said wounds were inflicted by two (2) guns of similar caliber, as both have the
same measurements (TSN, Vol. V, pp. 46-47, Hearing of February 2, 1984).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense, giving an entirely different
version of the incident, presented the following witness:</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant himself, <u>Rolando</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Maranion</u></span>,
testified that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On July 27, 1980 at
around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Sta.
Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila, Pat. Antonio Benito
arrived requesting him for company to arrest a Chinese drug pusher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He accompanied Benito and the two of them
boarded a jeep en route to <st1:place><st1:placename>Rosario</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Bridge</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They alighted from the jeep and took a taxi,
and proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Cogeo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>,
where Pat. Benito alighted, asking him to wait as he (Benito) was to look for
somebody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter returned after a
few minutes and asked the taxi driver to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Daang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bakal</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
and upon reaching said place, Pat. Benito again alighted from the taxi and told
<span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> to wait.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While waiting for Benito for about three (3) hours, <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>
took a snack with the taxi driver whom he came to know as <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ragudo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Benito
finally returned holding a bag with shoes in it and told them that they would
go to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> and
upon reaching a certain portion thereat asked the driver to park at a gasoline
station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Benito alighted from the taxi
and asked <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> to go to <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span>
Variety Mart and take a snack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He went
to the store and ordered a soft drink and a piece of bread, and while taking
his snack, Patrolman Benito arrived at the store holding a gun, grabbing the
housemaid (<span class="SpellE">Criselda</span>) and bringing her inside the
store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said he was tongue-tied when
he heard Benito announce the hold-up and at the same time saw Benito poke his
gun at the housemaids and at Margarita, whom he (Benito) dragged to the room
where the housemaids were.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>William See
Chi suddenly approached Pat. Benito and hit the latter with his crutches
(William was an amputee).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
former fell down, Benito shot him twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Benito then poked his gun at <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>, and
because of nervousness, the latter bumped an old man behind him who was put off
balance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he (<span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>)
tried to help the old man get up, he heard another gunshot and discovered that
he (<span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>) was bleeding, prompting him to flee and
run towards the waiting taxi at the gasoline station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told the driver to go but the taxi could
not leave the place because there were vehicles blocking the way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Benito suddenly appeared and poked his gun at
him, boarded the taxi and told them to follow instructions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said taxi proceeded to Crossing where
Benito instructed <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> to get another taxi so
that they can go to a hospital to have the latter's wound treated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Boarding another taxi, they proceeded to
Rotonda, Pasig, where they alighted at a nearby gas station, only to find out
that Benito would not allow him to go to a hospital for fear of being
investigated, at the same time warning <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> not
to report to the police what happened, lest he would be killed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> just went
home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Vol. 9, pp. 90-105, Hearing
of September 29, 1986; TSN, Vol. 11, pp. 105-125, Hearing of March 9, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused <span class="SpellE"><u>Arsenio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Ragudo</u></span> for the most part corroborated the testimony
of the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He declared that while waiting for <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> and Pat. Benito, which took a long time, he
decided to look for a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> or police officer to
accompany him in looking for the two, as the reading in his taxi meter had
already registered a big amount (P20.00), when he heard successive gunshots
coming from the direction of the place where <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>
and Benito proceeded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> went back to the taxi bleeding, asking him to rush
to a hospital, but they were not able to leave the place immediately because of
people blocking the way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Pat.
Benito came back to them, he poked his gun at <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>
and instructed that they proceed to <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After unloading the two at <span class="SpellE">Rotonda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> and without being
paid a single centavo, <span class="SpellE">Ragudo</span> went to his operator
and asked the latter to accompany him to the police station to report the
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Vol. 13, pp. 147-161,
Hearing of August 11, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 8, 1989, the trial court rendered judgment, the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, based on all the foregoing considerations, the
Court finds and declares accused ROLANDO MARANION guilty beyond reasonable
doubt as principal by direct participation, of the offense of robbery with
double homicide under Article 294, paragraph (1) of the Revised Penal Code
(Criminal Case No. 42567) and considering the absence of modifying
circumstances, the said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, with the accessories prescribed by
law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Likewise, accused ARSENIO RAGUDO is found guilty beyond reasonable
doubt, as an accomplice and is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of
six (6) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
as maximum, with the accessories prescribed by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, the two (2) accused are also ordered to pay and
indemnify in <span class="SpellE"><u>solidum</u></span> the heirs of William See
Chi in the sum of P30,000.00 and the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>
de la Cruz in the like sum of P30,000.00 and to proportionately pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Criminal Case No. 42568, for illegal possession of firearms, is
DISMISSED." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 38; Decision, p. 18)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this instant appeal by defendant-appellant Rolando <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ragudo</span> withdrew his
Notice of Appeal (Records, p. 569).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant raised this lone assignment of error, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> ERRED IN FINDING THE
ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF ROBBERY WITH DOUBLE
HOMICIDE ON THE BASIS OF ALLEGED CONSPIRACY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS CO-ACCUSED PAT.
ANTONIO BENITO WHICH WAS NOT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED AND PROVEN BY THE
PROSECUTION." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of this appeal is whether or not the guilt of the
accused-appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt to justify
conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the prosecution evidence establishing
conspiracy is insufficient and consequently, does not warrant a finding of
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims
that he had no knowledge of the plan of his co-accused Pat. Benito to commit
the robbery and he did not participate in the killings on the occasion
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He insisted that he had been
misled by Benito into accompanying the latter supposedly to arrest a Chinese
drug pusher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the time he was
fetched from his house by Benito until they reached <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, after several hours of being together, he
declared that he had been completely unaware of the motive and plan of Benito
to commit such a nefarious enterprise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, he maintained that he was taken by surprise when while at the <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span> Variety Mart taking his snacks, Benito arrived and
announced a hold-up (TSN, Vol. 9, p. 6, Hearing of September 26, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He even claimed to have been bleeding when he
tried to help a fallen old man whom he bumped near the store just as he heard
gunshots apparently fired by his companion, Benito (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is the position of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> that he was tricked into joining
Benito and later threatened and coerced by the latter, and that Benito
individually and solely committed the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record shows otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conspiracy among the accused in the
commission of the crime is reflected by proven facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening of
July 27, 1980, at the <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span> Variety Mart, <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila,
William See Chi, storeowner, and a regular customer, <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>
de la Cruz, were both shot dead in the course of a robbery where both appellant
and his companion, Benito, were present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant and his co-accused were together before, during and after the
commission of the crime (TSN, Vol. 11, pp. 9-21, Hearing of March 9, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">Although appellant claims that he was merely asked by Pat. Benito
to assist the latter arrest an alleged drug pusher, there is no showing,
however, that Benito gave appellant instructions on how the drug pusher would
be arrested and other pertinent details pertaining to said arrest (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 4-10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Law enforcement operations,
such as this, normally require a plan or strategy carefully delineated on how
to go about the same, more especially when civilians are involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As opined by the trial court, the pretension
that a supposed arrest would be undertaken has been altogether negated by no
less than the testimony of said appellant (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
36).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather, for being together for
quite a considerable period of time before the commission of the crime,
appellant and Benito must have laid the "blueprint", so to speak, for
the execution of the robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certain acts of the appellant during the progress of the robbery
manifest that he and his companion, Benito, had a common evil design and
objective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For immediately after Benito
had announced the hold-up, appellant closed the door of the store (TSN, Vol. I,
p. 3, Hearing of September 13, 1982; <u>Ibid</u>., Vol. 2, p. 12 &amp; 13,
Hearing of March 24, 1983).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
appellant was still seen at the store counter during the progress of the
robbery (TSN, Vol. III, p. 28, Hearing of May 18, 1983).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while outside the store pretending to
have his snacks, appellant saw to it that the coast was clear for a hold-up and
when his companion, Benito, arrived at the store announcing the hold-up,
appellant closed the door of the store presumably to prevent those persons
inside the store from shouting for help and likewise, those outside from
witnessing the hold-up thus enhancing the successful execution of the scheme.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant had all the opportunity to break away from Benito, if
indeed he did not know what was to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was free when Benito was busy herding the housemaids and Mrs. See Chi
into a room inside the building (TSN, Vol. 11, p. 14, Hearing of March 9,
1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could have run away when the
Chinese storeowner hit Benito with the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
crutches, prompting the accused to shoot the fallen victim (<u>Ibid</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could have gone home or to the nearest
police precinct when he ran away from the scene of the crime (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
18-19).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he did not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, records show that appellant
was seen together with Benito heading towards a taxi driven by their co?accused
<span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ragudo</span>, who started
the engine of the vehicle and proceeded towards the direction of the rushing
duo and fled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Vol. IV, p. 40,
Hearing of June 7, 1983).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And for
thirteen days, before Pat. Benito paid appellant another visit, the latter did
not report the incident to the authorities (TSN, Vol. 11, pp. 23-24, Hearing of
March 9, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranion's</span> conduct or
behavior before, during and after the commission of the heinous crime does not
sit well with his posture of innocence as his conduct <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span>
the acts of his co-accused discloses a common understanding between them with
respect to the commission of the offense (People vs. De la Cruz, G.R. No.
84714, October 5, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement
concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it, whether they act
through the physical volition of one or all, proceeding severally or
collectively (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Laguardia</span>, 148 SCRA 133
[1987]; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>, 148 SCRA 178 [1987].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And conspiracy need not be established by
direct evidence of acts charged, but may and generally must be proved by a
number of indefinite acts, conditions and circumstances, which vary according
to the purpose accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Previous
agreement to commit a crime is not essential to establish conspiracy (People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Abueg</span>, 145 SCRA 622 [1986], it being sufficient
that the conditions attending its commission and the acts executed may be
indicative of a common design to accomplish a criminal purpose and objective
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span>, 178 SCRA 56 [1989]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there is a chain of circumstances to that
effect, conspiracy has been established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<u>Ibid</u>.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The very existence of conspiracy is a matter of inference, as a
rule, deduced from certain acts of the persons accused, done in pursuance of an
apparent criminal or unlawful purpose common between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The existence of the agreement, or joint
assent of the minds need not be proved directly (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Saavedra</span>,
149 SCRA 623 [1987]; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Laguardia</span> and People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>, <u style="text-underline:words">in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u style="text-underline:words">fra</u></span>; Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, G.R. No. 58876, November 27, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">No conclusion, therefore, can be drawn from the acts of appellant
<span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> except that from his conduct before, during
and after the commission of the crime, he is a confederate in the commission of
the crime of robbery and at the very least, approved of the act of his
companion, Benito, in firing upon the victims to forestall any opposition to
the successful execution of the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well-settled is the rule that a person may be convicted for the criminal
act of another, where between them, there has been conspiracy or unity and
intention in the commission of the offense charged (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Talla</span>, 181 SCRA 133, [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">For indeed, it is<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>well-entrenched
in our jurisprudence that when there is conspiracy, the act of one is the act
of all, and all persons taking part in the crime shall be held guilty as
principals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is of no moment that not
all the accused took part in the actual commission of every act constituting
the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each is responsible for all
the acts of the others done in the furtherance of the conspiracy (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, 182 SCRA 95 [1990]; People vs. Quinones, 183 SCRA
747 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> never fired a gun, he would
still be principally liable as a co-conspirator in the killing of William See
Chi and <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> de la Cruz, for while only Benito
might have inflicted the fatal blows or wounds, nevertheless, he (appellant)
must be held liable for the killings under the principle that the act of a
conspirator is the act of all co-conspirators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The degree of actual participation in the commission of the crime is
immaterial in a conspiracy (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cantuba</span>, 183
SCRA 289 [1990]; People vs. Centre, 186 SCRA 76 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed, therefore, in the case at bar is Robbery
with Homicide as defined and penalized under Article 294, par. (1) of the
Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the killing of
the victims is directly linked to the robbery and such unquestionably happened
during and on the occasion of the robbery, the crime committed is robbery with
homicide (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Nabaluna</span>, 142 SCRA 446
[1986]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only the result obtained,
without reference or distinction as to the circumstances, causes, modes or
persons intervening in the commission of the crime that his to be taken into
consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All those who took part
in the commission of the robbery as principals are also adjudged as principals
in the special complex crime of "<span class="SpellE"><u>robo</u></span> <u>con</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>homicidio</u></span>", although they did not
actually take part in the homicide, unless it clearly appears that any or some
of them endeavored to prevent the homicide (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pecato</span>,
151 SCRA 14 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
the evidence on record is bereft of any showing that appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span> tried to prevent the killing of the victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is shown instead is that appellant
merely stood watching and doing nothing when his companion, Benito shot the
victims on the occasion of the robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it must be stressed at this juncture that it is the
nature of the crime of robbery with homicide that the homicides, irrespective
of their number, committed on the occasion of or by reason of the robbery, are
merged in the composite crime of "robbery with homicide".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is error therefore, to treat the death of the
victims as "double or multiple homicide", for in this special complex
crime, the number of persons killed is immaterial and does not increase the
penalty prescribed in Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code (People vs. Solis,
G.R. Nos. 78732-33, February 14, 1990; People vs. Quinones, <u>infra</u>.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the decision of the trial court is
hereby AFFIRMED, holding appellant Rolando <span class="SpellE">Maranion</span>
guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the special complex crime of
robbery with homicide, as defined and penalized under Article 294, par. 1 of
the Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amount of
civil indemnity awarded must, however, be increased to FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS
(P50,000.00) for <u>each</u> of the two (2) victims, William See Chi and <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> de la Cruz, in line with the policy adopted by this
Court <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u> on August 30,1990 (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sazon</span>,
G.R. No. 89684, September 18, 1990; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Jereza</span>,
G.R. No. 86230, September 18, 1990).</p>
