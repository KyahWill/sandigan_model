				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Court
of Appeals' decision declaring Salvador <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> a
leasehold tenant entitled to security of tenure on a parcel of land consisting
of 1,740 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January <span style="">13, </span>1981,
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> filed a verified complaint with the
Court of Agrarian Relations, Branch VI at <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> alleging that since January, 1955 he had been in
continuous possession as a share tenant of a parcel of land with an area of
about 2 hectares situated in San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
which was pre­viously owned by one Socorro <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>; that on or about December 27, 1980, and
thereafter, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> began to threaten him
to desist from entering and cultivating a portion of the aforesaid land with an
area of 4,000 square meters an otherwise committed acts in violation of his
security of tenure; that the <span class="SpellE">Hilarios</span> were
contemplating the putting up of a fence around the said portion of 4,000 square
meters and that unless res­trained by the court, they would continue to do so
to his great irreparable injury.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> claims that he became a tenant
of Socorro P. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span> on the latter's two-hectare landhold­ing located
at <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> by virtue of a "<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>"
executed between them on <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="1">January 8,
 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He states that he
erected his house and planted "<span class="SpellE">halaman</span>",
the <span class="GramE">produce</span> of which was divided at 70-30 and 50-50
(sic) in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">After
the death of Socorro P. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>, he allegedly gave the
share pertaining to the landowner to her daughter Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in December, 1980 that he came to
know that a portion of the 2 hectares or 4,000 square meters is already owned
by the <span class="SpellE">Hilarios</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the petitioners aver that they acquired the
landholding of 4,000 square meters from the Philippine National Bank (PNB)
after it had been fore­closed by virtue of a deed of sale executed between <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> and the
PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former owner Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengzon</span> testified that she owned only two lots - <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
427-B with an area of 841 square meters and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 427-C
with an area of 899 square meters with a total area of 1,740 square
meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other 2 lots were owned by
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Juan Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further testified that in 1964 at the
time of the partition of the property, she declared the property for
classification purposes as "<span class="SpellE">bakuran</span>"
located in the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> and had no knowledge that
there were other things planted in it except bananas and <span class="SpellE">pomelos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1981</st1:date>,
the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) in determining whether or not respondent <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> is the tenant of the petitioners ruled that the
land in question is not an agricultural landholding but plain "<span class="SpellE">bakuran</span>"<span class="GramE">,</span> hence, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> is not a tenant on the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1982</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals, however, remanded the case to the lower court for further
proceedings on the ground that the findings of the Court of Agrarian Relations
(CAR) were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In compliance with the
order of the Court of Appeals, </span><span style="">the
</span>CAR admitted additional evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1983</st1:date>,
the CAR admitted the petitioners' third party complaint filed with leave
against the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which states that in the event that
judgment would be rendered against them under the original complaint, the PNB
must contribute, indemnify, and reimburse the spouses the full amount of the
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the parties' and their witnesses' affidavits
containing detailed narrations of facts and documentary exhibits which served
as their direct testimonies pursuant to PD 946, the CAR found that there was no
tenancy relationship existing between <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and
the former owner, Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring plaintiff
not to be a tenant on the landholding des­cribed in the complaint and ordering
his <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The third-party complaint is hereby dismissed for lack of
merit." (pp. 25-26, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, respondent
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> appealed to the then Intermediate
Appellate Court (IAC).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The IAC, however,
reversed the decision of the CAR and held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> [T]he </span>decision appealed from is hereby SET
ASIDE, and another one entered declaring plaintiff-appellant a leasehold tenant
entitled to security of tenure on the land in question consisting of 1,740
square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>."</span> (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, the spouses
<span class="SpellE">Hilarios</span> filed this peti­tion for review making the
following assignments of errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">I.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF CAR, FINDING THE LOTS IN QUESTION WITH AN AREA OF
1,740 SQUARE METERS AS RESIDENTIAL <st1:place>LOT</st1:place> AND PRIVATE
RESPONDENT NOT TO BE A TENANT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the
respondent court when it stated that it can affirm on appeal the findings of
the CAR only if there is substantial evidence to support them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, after a careful consideration of the
records of the case, we find no valid reason to deviate from the </span><span style="">findings of the CAR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence presented by the petitioners is
more than sufficient to justify the con­clusion that private respondent
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> is not a tenant of the landholding
in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Salvador <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> claims:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that he is working on the land in question pursuant to a "<span class="SpellE">kasunduan</span>" executed between him and Socorro <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contract covers a two-hectare parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The disputed landholding is only 4,000 square meters more or less,
although <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> claims that this area is a portion
of the two hectares in the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that sometime in 1965, he relinquished 1.5 hectares of the two
hectares subject of the "<span class="SpellE">kasunduan</span>" to <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Juan Mendoza,
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Miguel Viola and what remained
under his cultivation was 1/2 hectare owned by Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that when Socorro <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span> died, no new contract was executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he insists that the old contract was
continued between Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengson</span> and himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">rollo</span></span>,
p. 23).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This claim is <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the testimony of Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengson</span> herself which we quote as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style=""> </span>After the death of your mother in 1965, what step, if any, have you
taken regarding this subject landholding or after the death of your mother how

pp. 15-19, hearing of August 5, 1981).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengson</span> further explained that she did not receive any
share from the produce of the land from 1964 up to the filing of the case and
she would not have accepted any </span><span style="">share
</span>from <span style="">the produce of the land
because </span><span style="">she
</span><span style="">knew pretty well that she was no
longer the owner of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">lot </span><span style="">since </span><span style="">1974 </span><span style="">when </span><span style="">it was foreclosed by the bank and later on purchased by the spouses </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Hilarios</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We note the <span class="SpellE">CAR's</span> finding:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Tenancy relationship is indivisible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The two-hectare land
subject of plaintiff's alleged contract with Socorro <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>
having been <span class="SpellE">parcelled</span> into seven (7) and possession
thereof relinquished/surrendered in 1965 results in the termination of
plaintiff’s tenancy relationship with the previous owner/landholder.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, he cannot now claim that
the landholding in question consisting of 4,000 square meters, more or less, is
being cultivated by him under the old contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The owner thereof Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengson</span> has no
tenancy relationship with him (plaintiff).” (p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the foregoing, it is
clear that Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengson</span> did not give her consent
to <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> to work on her land </span><span style="">consisting </span><span style="">of only </span><span style="">1,740 </span><span style="">square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the CAR when it said:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The law accords the landholder the right to initially choose
his tenant to work on his land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, tenancy relationship can only be created with the consent of the true
and lawful landholder through lawful means and not by imposition or
usurpation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the mere cultivation of
the land by usurper cannot confer upon him any legal right to work the land as
tenant and enjoy the protection of security of tenure of the law (Spouses <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> <span style="">v. Court
of Appeals, </span>130 SCRA 482)" (<u>Ibid</u>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tuazon</u></span><u> v. Court of Appeals</u> (118 SCRA 484),
this Court had the occasion to explain:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Tenancy is not <span style="">a </span>purely
factual relationship dependent on what the alleged tenant does upon the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also a legal
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intent of the parties,
the understanding when the farmer is installed, and, as in this case, their
written agreements, provided these are complied with and are not contrary to
law, are even more important."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent court
ruled that the fact that the land in question is located in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> does not necessarily make it residential.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion <span style="">is </span>purely
speculative and conjectural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note
that the evidence presented by the petitioners sufficiently establishes that
the land in question is residential and not agricultural.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we stated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tiongson</u></span><u> v.
Court of Appeals</u> (<u>supra</u>) "the key factor in ascertaining
whether or not there is a landowner-tenant relationship in this case is the
nature of the disputed property."</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the disputed property, only 1,740 square
meters in area, is actually located in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> not far from the municipal
building and the church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is divided
into two lots -- <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 427-B with an area of 841 square
meters and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 427-C with an area of 899 square
meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two other lots which the
respondent claims to cultivate as "tenant" were originally owned by
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Juan Mendoza, not Corazon <span class="SpellE">Pengson</span>, through whom the respondent traces his alleged
tenancy rights.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> is a full-time government employee working in the
Bureau of Plant Industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The disputed lots were acquired at a foreclosure sale from the
Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were pur­chased
as residential lots and the deed of sale describes them as
"residential".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inspection
and appraisal report of the PNB classified the land as residential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The declaration of real property on the basis
of which taxes are paid and approved by the Acting Provincial Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> classifies the land as residential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tax declarations show that the 841 square
meter lot is assessed for tax purposes at P25<span class="GramE">,236.00</span>
while the 899 square meter lot is assessed at P26,920.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner states that the land has only
bananas and <span class="SpellE">pomelos</span> on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if the claim of the private
respondent <span style="">that </span>some corn was
planted on the lots is true, this does not convert residential land into
agricultural land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption assumed by the appellate court, that a parcel of
land which is located in a <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> is not
necessarily devoted to residential purposes, is wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be the other way around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot inside the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
should be presumed residential, or commercial or non-agricultural unless there
is clearly preponderant evidence to show that it is agricultural.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court also failed to note that the alleged tenant
pays no rental or share to the landowners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> made a vague allegation that he
shared 70-30 and 50-50 of the produce in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former owner flatly denied that she ever
received anything from him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The requirements set by
law for the existence of a tenancy relationship, </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) The parties are the landholder and
tenant; (2) The subject is agricultural land; (3) The purpose is agricultural
production; and (4) <span class="GramE">There</span> is consideration; have not
been met by the private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tiongson</u></span><u> v. Court of Appeals</u>, cited above
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><u>"All these requisites are neces­sary in order to create
tenancy relationship</u> between the parties and the absence of one or more
requisites do not make the alleged tenant a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> tenant as
contradistinguished from a <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>
tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is<span style=""> so </span>because unless a person has established his status as a <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> tenant, he is not entitled to security of
tenure nor is he covered by the Land Reform Program of the Government under
exist­ing tenancy laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> ."</span> (<span class="GramE">underlining</span> supplied).</blockquote>
