				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
<p>In this petition for <em><em>certiorari</em></em> and <em>mandamus</em>, the 
People of the Philippines seek to set aside the orders of the respondent Judge 
of the Court of First Instance of Batangas in Criminal Case No. 266, dated 12 
August 1976 and 8 November 1976, respectively, quashing an information for theft 
filed against private respondent Manuel Opulencia on the ground of double 
jeopardy and denying the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On 1 
February 1975, members of the Batangas City Police together with personnel of 
the Batangas Electric Light System, equipped with a search warrant issued by a 
city judge of Batangas City, searched and examined the premises of the Opulencia 
Carpena Ice Plant and Cold Storage owned and operated by the private respondent 
Manuel Opulencia.&nbsp; The police discovered that electric wiring, devices and 
contraptions had been installed, without the necessary authority from the city 
government, and "architecturally concealed inside the walls of the building"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> owned by the private respondent.&nbsp; These 
electric devices and contraptions were, in the allegation of the petitioner 
"designed purposely to lower or decrease the readings of electric current 
consumption in the electric meter of the said electric [ice and cold storage] 
plant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> During the subsequent 
investigation, Manuel Opulencia admitted in a written statement that he had 
caused the installation of the electrical devices "in order to lower or decrease 
the readings of his electric meter".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On 24 November 1975, an Assistant 
City Fiscal of Batangas City filed before the City Court of Batangas City an 
information against Manuel Opulencia for violation of Ordinance No. 1, Series of 
1974, Batangas City.&nbsp; A violation of this ordinance was, under its terms, 
punishable by a fine "ranging from Five Pesos (P5.00) to Fifty Pesos (P50.00) or 
imprisonment, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, or both, at the 
discretion of the court".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This 
information read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"The undersigned, Assistant City Fiscal, accuses Manuel Opulencia y 
Lat of violation of Sec. 3 (b) in relation to Sec. 6 (d) and Sec. 10 Article II, 
Title IV of ordinance No. 1, S. 1974, with damage to the City Government of 
Batangas, and penalized by the said ordinance, committed as follows:<br><br>That 
from November, 1974 to February, 1975 at Batangas City, Philippines and within 
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­ named accused, with intent 
to defraud the City Government of Batangas, without proper authorization from 
any lawful and/or permit from the proper authorities, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously make unauthorized installations of electric 
wirings and devices to lower or decrease the consumption of electric fluid at 
the Opulencia Ice Plant situated at Kumintang, Ibaba, this city and as a result 
of such unauthorized installations of electric wirings and devices made by the 
accused, the City Government of Batangas was damaged and prejudiced in the total 
amount of FORTY ONE THOUSAND, SIXTY TWO PESOS AND SIXTEEN CENTAVOS (P41,062.16) 
Philippine currency, covering the period from November 1974 to February, 1975, 
to the damage and prejudice of the City Government of Batangas in the 
aforestated amount of P41,062.16, Philippine currency."
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The accused Manuel Opulencia pleaded not guilty to the above information.&nbsp; On 
2 February 1976, he filed a motion to dismiss the information upon the grounds 
that the crime there charged had already prescribed and that the civil indemnity 
there sought to be recovered was beyond the jurisdiction of the Batangas City 
Court to award.&nbsp; In an order dated 6 April 1976, the Batangas City Court granted 
the motion to dismiss on the ground of prescription, it appearing that the 
offense charged was a light felony which prescribes two months from the time of 
discovery thereof, and it appearing further that the information was filed by 
the fiscal more than nine months after discovery of the offense charged in 
February 1975.<br><br>Fourteen (14) days later, on 20 April 1976, the Acting 
City Fiscal of Batangas City filed before the Court of First Instance of 
Batangas, Branch II, another information against Manuel Opulencia, this time for 
theft of electric power under Article 308 in relation to Article 309, paragraph 
(1), of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; This information read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"The undersigned Acting City Fiscal accuses Manuel Opulencia y Lat 
of the crime of theft, defined and penalized by Article 308, in relation to 
Article 309, paragraph (1) of the Revised Penal Code, committed as 
follows:<br><br>That on, during, and between the month of November, 1974, and 
the 21st day of February, 1975, at Kumintang, Ibaba, Batangas City, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, 
with intent of gain and without the knowledge and consent of the Batangas 
Electric Light System, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
take, steal and appropriate electric current valued in the total amount of FORTY 
ONE THOUSAND, SIXTY TWO PESOS AND SIXTEEN CENTAVOS (P41,062.16) Philippine 
currency, to the damage and prejudice of the said Batangas Electric Light 
System, owned and operated by the City Government of Batangas, in the 
aforementioned sum of P41,062.16.”
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The above information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 266 before the Court 
of First Instance of Batangas, Branch II.&nbsp; Before he could be arraigned thereon, 
Manuel Opulencia filed a Motion to Quash, dated 5 May 1976, alleging that he had 
been previously acquitted of the offense charged in the second information and 
that the filing thereof was violative of his constitutional right against double 
jeopardy.&nbsp; By Order dated 16 August 1976, the respondent Judge granted the 
accused's Motion to Quash and ordered the case dismissed.&nbsp; The gist of this 
Order is set forth in the following paragraphs:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only question 
here is whether the dismissal of the first case can be properly pleaded by the 
accused in the motion to quash.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first paragraph of the earlier 
information, it alleges that the prosecution "accuses Manuel Opulencia y Lat of 
violation of Sec. 3(b) in relation to Sec. 6(d) and Sec. 10 Article II, Title IV 
of Ordinance No. 1, s. 1974, <em>with damage to the City Government of Batangas, 
etc</em>." (underlining supplied).&nbsp; The first case, as it appears, was not 
simply one of illegal electrical connections.&nbsp; It also covered an amount of 
P41,062.16 which the accused, in effect, allegedly with intent to defraud, 
deprived the city government of Batangas If the charge had meant illegal 
electric installations only, it could have alleged illegal connections which 
were done at one instance on a particular date between November, 1974, to 
February 21, 1975.&nbsp; But as the information states "<em>that from November, 1974 
to February 1975 </em>at Batangas City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, <em>with intent to defraud&nbsp; 
the City Government of Batangas, without </em>proper authorization from any 
lawful and/or permit from the proper authorities, <em>did then and there&nbsp; 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously make&nbsp; unauthorized installations of 
electric wirings and&nbsp; devices, etc.</em>" (underline supplied), it was meant to 
include the P41,062.16 which the accused had, in effect, defrauded the city 
government.&nbsp; The information could not have meant that from November 1974 to 21 
February 1975, he had daily committed unlawful installations.</p>
<blockquote>When, therefore, he was arraigned and he faced the indictment before 
the City Court, he had already been exposed, or he felt he was exposed to 
consequences of what allegedly happened between November 1974 to February 21, 
1975 which had allegedly resulted in defrauding the City of Batangas in the 
amount of P41,062.16." (Emphases and parentheses in the original)
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>A Motion for Reconsideration of the above-quoted Order filed by the 
petitioner was denied by the respondent Judge in an Order dated 18 November 
1976.<br><br>On 1 December 1976, the present Petition for <em>Certiorari</em> 
and <em>Mandamus</em> was filed in this Court by the Acting City Fiscal of 
Batangas City on behalf of the People.<br><br>The basic premise of the 
petitioner's position is that the constitutional protection against double 
jeopardy is protection against a second or later jeopardy of conviction for the 
<em>same offense</em>.&nbsp; The petitioner stresses that the first information filed 
before the City Court of Batangas City was one for unlawful or unauthorized 
installation of electrical wiring and devices, acts which were in violation of 
an ordinance of the City Government of Batangas.&nbsp; Only two elements are needed 
to constitute an offense under this City Ordinance:&nbsp; (1) that there was such an 
installation; and (2) no authority therefor had been obtained from the 
Superintendent of the Batangas City Electrical System or the District Engineer.&nbsp; 
The petitioner urges that the relevant terms of the City Ordinance — which read 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Section 3 —&nbsp; <em>Connection and Installation</em>:<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
x x x<br><br>(b)&nbsp; The work and installation in the houses and building and their 
connection with the Electrical System shall be done either by the employee of 
the system duly authorized by its Superintendent or by persons adept in the 
matter duly authorized by the District Engineer.&nbsp; Applicants for electrical 
service permitting the works of installation or connection with the system to be 
undertaken by the persons not duly authorized therefor shall be considered 
guilty of violation of the ordinance." 
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>would show that:</p>
<blockquote>"The principal purpose for (sic) such a provision is to ensure that 
electrical installations on residences or buildings be done by persons duly 
authorized or adept in the matter, to avoid fires and accidents due to faulty 
electrical wirings.&nbsp; It is primarily a regulatory measure and not intended to 
punish or curb theft of electric fluid which is already covered by the Revised 
Penal Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The gist of the offense under the City Ordinance, the petitioner's argument 
continues, is the installing of electric wiring and devices without authority 
from the proper officials of the city government.&nbsp; To constitute an offense 
under the city ordinance, it is not essential to establish any mens rea on the 
part of the offender generally speaking, nor, more specifically, an intent to 
appropriate and steal electric fluid.<br><br>In contrast, the petitioner goes 
on, the offense of theft under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code filed 
before the Court of First Instance of Batangas in Criminal Case No. 266 has 
quite different essential elements.&nbsp; These elements are:</p>
<blockquote>"1. That personal property be taken;<br><br>2.&nbsp; That the personal 
property (taken) belongs to another;<br><br>3.&nbsp; That the taking be done with 
intent of gain;<br><br>4.&nbsp; That the taking be done without the consent of the 
owner; and<br><br>5.&nbsp; That the taking be accomplished without violence against 
or intimidation of persons or force upon things."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The petitioner also alleges, correctly, in our view, that theft of 
electricity can be effected even without illegal or unauthorized installations 
of any kind by, for instance, any of the following means:</p>
<blockquote>"1.&nbsp; Turning back the dials of the electric meter;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Fixing 
the electric meter in such a manner that it will not register the actual 
electrical consumption;<br><br>3.&nbsp; Under-reading of electrical consumption; 
and<br><br>4.&nbsp; By tightening the screw of the rotary blade to slow down the 
rotation of the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The petitioner concludes that:</p>
<blockquote>"The unauthorized installation punished by the ordinance [of 
Batangas City] is <em>not the same </em>as theft of electricity [under the 
Revised Penal Code]; that the <em>second offense is not an attempt</em>&nbsp; to 
commit the first or a<em> frustration thereof </em>and that the second offense 
is not <em>necessarily&nbsp; included in the offense charged in the first&nbsp; 
information</em>".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The above arguments made by the petitioner are of course correct.&nbsp; This is 
clear both from the express terms of the constitutional provision involved — 
which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment <em>for 
the</em> <em>same offense</em>.&nbsp; If an act is punished by a law and an 
ordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to 
another prosecution for the same act." (Emphasis supplied; Article IV (22), 1973 
Constitution)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>
<p>and from our case law on this point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The basic difficulty with the 
petitioner's position is that it must be examined, not under the terms of the 
first sentence of Article IV (22) of the 1973 Constitution, but rather <em>under 
the second sentence of the same section</em>.&nbsp; The first sentence of Article IV 
(22) sets forth the general rule:&nbsp; the constitutional protection against double 
jeopardy is not available where the second prosecution is for an offense that is 
different from the offense charged in the first or prior prosecution, although 
both the first and second offenses may be based upon the same act or set of 
acts.&nbsp; The second sentence of Article IV (22) embodies an exception to the 
general proposition:&nbsp; the constitutional protection against double jeopardy is 
available although the prior offense charged under an ordinance be different 
from the offense charged subsequently under a national statute such as the 
Revised Penal Code, <em>provided </em>that both offenses spring from the same 
act or set of acts.&nbsp; This was made clear sometime ago in <em>Yap vs. 
Lutero</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In <em>Yap</em>, 
petitioner Manuel Yap was charged in Criminal Case No. 16054 of the Municipal 
Court of Iloilo City, with violation of Article 14 of Ordinance No. 22, Series 
of 1951, in relation to Ordinance No. 15, Series of 1954, of the City of 
Iloilo.&nbsp; The information charged him with having "wilfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously drive[n] and operate[d]" an automobile —"recklessly and without 
reasonable caution thereby endangering other vehicles and pedestrians passing in 
said street." Three months later, Yap was again charged in Criminal Case No. 
16443 of the same Municipal Court, this time with serious physical injuries 
through reckless imprudence.&nbsp; The information charged him with violation of the 
Revised Motor Vehicle Law (Act No. 3992 as amended by Republic Act No. 587) 
committed by driving and operating an automobile in a reckless and negligent 
manner and as a result thereof inflicting injuries upon an unfortunate 
pedestrian.&nbsp; Yap moved to quash the second information upon the ground that it 
placed him twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same act.&nbsp; This motion was 
denied by the respondent municipal judge.&nbsp; Meantime, another municipal judge had 
acquitted Yap in Criminal Case No 16054.&nbsp; Yap then instituted a petition for 
<em>certiorari</em> in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to set aside the 
order of the respondent municipal judge.&nbsp; The Court of First Instance of Iloilo 
having reversed the respondent municipal judge and having directed him to desist 
from continuing with Criminal Case No. 16443, the respondent Judge brought the 
case to the Supreme Court for review on appeal.&nbsp; In affirming the decision 
appealed from and holding that the constitutional protection against double 
jeopardy was available to petitioner Yap, then Associate Justice and later Chief 
Justice Roberto Concepcion wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"To begin with, the crime of damage to property through reckless 
driving — with which Diaz stood charged in the court of first instance — is a 
violation of the Revised Penal Code (third paragraph of Article 365), not the 
Automobile Law (Act No. 3992, as amended by Republic Act No. 587).&nbsp; Hence, Diaz 
was <em>not</em> twice accused of a violation of the same law.&nbsp; Secondly, 
reckless driving and certain crimes committed through reckless driving are 
punishable under<em> different provisions</em> of said Automobile Law.&nbsp; Hence — 
from the view point of Criminal Law, as distinguished from political or 
Constitutional Law — they constitute, strictly, different offenses, although 
under certain conditions, one offense may include the other, and accordingly, 
once placed in jeopardy for one, the plea of double jeopardy may be in order as 
regards the other, as in the Diaz case.&nbsp; (Emphases in the original)
<p></p>
<p>Thirdly, our Bill of Rights deals with two (2) kinds of double jeopardy.&nbsp; The 
first sentence of clause 20, section 1, Article III of the Constitution, ordains 
that” no person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same 
<em>offense</em>." (Emphasis in the original) The second sentence of said clause 
provides that "if an act is punishable by a law and an ordinance, conviction or 
acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to another prosecution for the 
same act".&nbsp; <em>Thus, the first sentence prohibits double jeopardy of punishment 
for the same offense, whereas the second contemplates double jeopardy of 
punishment for the same act.&nbsp; Under the first sentence, one may be twice put in 
jeopardy of punishment of the same act, provided that he is charged with 
different offenses, or the offense charged in one case is not included in, or 
does not include, the crime charged in the other case.&nbsp; The second sentence 
applies, even if the offenses charged are not the same, owing to the fact that 
one constitutes a violation of an ordinance and the other a violation of a 
statute.&nbsp; If the two charges are based on one and the same&nbsp; act, conviction or 
acquittal under either the law&nbsp; or the ordinance shall bar a prosecution under 
the&nbsp; other</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Incidentally, such 
conviction or acquittal is not indispensable to sustain the plea of double 
jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.&nbsp; So long as jeopardy has attached 
under one of the informations charging said offense, the defense may be availed 
of in the other case involving the same offense, even if there has been neither 
conviction nor acquittal in either case.</p>
<p>The issue in the case at bar hinges, therefore, on whether or not, under the 
information in case No. 16443, petitioner could — if he failed to plead double 
jeopardy — be convicted of the same act charged in case No. 16054, in which he 
has already been acquitted.&nbsp; The information in case No. 16054 alleges, 
substantially, that on the date and in the place therein stated, petitioner 
herein had wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously driven and operated "recklessly 
and without reasonable caution" an automobile described in said information.&nbsp; 
Upon the other hand, the information in case No. 16443, similarly states that, 
on the same date and in the same place, petitioner drove and operated the 
aforementioned automobile in a "reckless and negligent manner at an excessive 
rate of speed and in violation of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law (Act No. 3992), 
as amended by Republic Act No. 587, and existing city ordinances".&nbsp; Thus, if the 
theories mentioned in the second information were not established by the 
evidence, petitioner could be convicted in case No. 16443 of the very same 
violation of municipal ordinance charged in case No. 16054, unless he pleaded 
double jeopardy.<br><br>It is clear, therefore, that the lower court has not 
erred eventually sustaining the theory of petitioner herein."</p></blockquote>
<p>Put a little differently, where the offenses charged are penalized either by 
different sections of the same statute or by different statutes, the important 
inquiry relates to the <em>identity of offenses charged</em>:&nbsp; the 
constitutional protection against double jeopardy<em> is</em> available only 
where an identity is shown to exist between the earlier and the subsequent 
offenses charged.&nbsp; In contrast, where one offense is charged under a municipal 
ordinance while the other is penalized by a statute, the critical inquiry is to 
the <em>identity of the acts</em> which the accused is said to have committed 
and which are alleged to have given rise to the two offenses:&nbsp; the 
constitutional protection against double jeopardy is available so long as the 
acts which constitute or have given rise to the first offense under a municipal 
ordinance are the same acts which constitute or have given rise to the offense 
charged under a statute.<br><br>The question may be raised why one rule should 
exist where two offenses under two different sections of the same statute or 
under different statutes are charged, and another rule for the situation where 
one offense is charged under a municipal ordinance and another offense under a 
national statute.&nbsp; If the second sentence of the double jeopardy provision had 
not been written into the Constitution, conviction or acquittal under a 
municipal ordinance would never constitute a bar to another prosecution for the 
same act under a national statute.&nbsp; An offense penalized by municipal ordinance 
is, by definition, different from an offense under a statute.&nbsp; The two offenses 
would never constitute the same offense having been promulgated by different 
rule-making authorities — though one be subordinate to the other — and the plea 
of double jeopardy would never lie.&nbsp; The discussions during the 1934-1935 
Constitutional Convention show that the second sentence was inserted precisely 
for the purpose of extending the constitutional protection against double 
jeopardy to a situation which would not otherwise be covered by the first 
sentence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The question of 
identity or lack of identity of offenses is addressed by examining the essential 
elements of each of the two offenses charged, as such elements are set out in 
the respective legislative definitions of the offenses involved.&nbsp; The question 
of identity of the acts which are claimed to have generated liability both under 
a municipal ordinance and a national statute must be addressed, in the first 
instance, by examining the location of such acts in time and space.&nbsp; When the 
acts of the accused as set out in the two informations are so related to each 
other in time and space as to be reasonably regarded as having taken place on 
the same occasion and where those acts have been moved by one and the same, or a 
continuing, intent or voluntary design or negligence, such acts may be 
appropriately characterized as an integral whole capable of giving rise to penal 
liability simultaneously under different legal enactments (a municipal ordinance 
and a national statute).<br><br>In <em>Yap</em>, the Court regarded the offense 
of reckless driving under the Iloilo City Ordinance and serious physical 
injuries through reckless imprudence under the Revised Motor Vehicle Law as 
derived from the same act or sets of acts — that is, the operation of an 
automobile in a reckless manner.&nbsp; The additional technical element of serious 
physical injuries related to the physical consequences of the operation of the 
automobile by the accused, <em>i.e.</em>, the impact of the automobile upon the 
body of the offended party.&nbsp; Clearly, such consequence occurred in the same 
occasion that the accused operated the automobile (recklessly).&nbsp; The moral 
element of negligence permeated the acts of the accused throughout that 
occasion.<br><br>In the instant case, the relevant acts took place within the 
same time frame:&nbsp; from November 1974 to February 1975.&nbsp; During this period, the 
accused Manuel Opulencia installed or permitted the installation of electrical 
wiring and devices in his ice plant without obtaining the necessary permit or 
authorization from the municipal authorities.&nbsp; The accused conceded that he 
effected or permitted such unauthorized installation for the very purpose of 
reducing his electric power bill.&nbsp; This corrupt intent was thus present from the 
very moment that such unauthorized installation began.&nbsp; The immediate physical 
effect of the unauthorized installation was the inward flow of electric current 
into Opulencia's ice plant without the corresponding recording thereof in his 
electric meter.&nbsp; In other words, the "taking" of electric current was integral 
with the unauthorized installation of electric wiring and devices.<br><br>It is 
perhaps important to note that the rule limiting the constitutional protection 
against double jeopardy to a subsequent prosecution for the same offense is not 
to be understood with absolute literalness.&nbsp; The identity of offenses that must 
be shown need not be absolute identity:&nbsp; the first and second offenses may be 
regarded as the "same offense" where the second offense necessarily includes the 
first offense or is necessarily included in such first offense or where the 
second offense is an attempt to commit the first or a frustration thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thus, for the constitutional plea of 
double jeopardy to be available, not all the technical elements constituting the 
first offense need be present in the technical definition of the second 
offense.&nbsp; The law here seeks to prevent harrassment of an accused person by 
multiple prosecutions for offenses which though different from one another are 
nonetheless each constituted by a common set or overlapping sets of technical 
elements.&nbsp; As Associate Justice and later Chief Justice Ricardo Paras cautioned 
in <em>People vs. del Carmen, et al.</em>, 88 Phil. 51 (1951):</p>
<blockquote>"While the rule against double jeopardy prohibits prosecution for 
the same offense, it seems elementary that an accused should be shielded against 
being prosecuted for several offenses made out from a single act.&nbsp; 
<em>Otherwise, an unlawful act or omission may give rise to&nbsp; several 
prosecutions depending upon the ability of the prosecuting officer to imagine or 
concoct as&nbsp; many offenses as can be justified by said act or omission, by simply 
adding or subtracting essential elements.&nbsp; Under the theory of appellant, the 
crime of rape may be converted into a crime of coercion, by merely alleging that 
by force and intimidation the accused prevented the offended girl from remaining 
a virgin." </em>(88 Phil. at 53; emphases supplied)
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>By the same token, acts of a person which physically occur on the same 
occasion and are infused by a common intent or design or negligence and 
therefore form a moral unity, should not be segmented and sliced, as it were, to 
produce as many different acts as there are offenses under municipal ordinances 
or statutes that an enterprising prosecutor can find. </p>
<p></p>It remains to point out that the dismissal by the Batangas City Court of 
the information for violation of the Batangas City Ordinance upon the ground 
that such offense had already prescribed, amounts to an acquittal of the accused 
of that offense.&nbsp; Under Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code, "prescription of 
the crime" is one of the grounds for "total extinction of criminal liability".&nbsp; 
Under the Rules of Court, an order sustaining a motion to quash based on 
prescription is a bar to another prosecution for the same offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>It is not without reluctance that 
we deny the people's petition for <em><em>certiorari</em></em> and 
<em>mandamus</em> in this case.&nbsp; It is difficult to summon any empathy for a 
businessman who would make or enlarge his profit by stealing from the 
community.&nbsp; Manuel Opulencia is able to escape criminal punishment because an 
Assistant City Fiscal by inadvertence or otherwise chose to file an information 
for an offense which he should have known had already prescribed.&nbsp; We are, 
however, compelled by the fundamental law to hold the protection of the right 
against double jeopardy available even to the private respondent in this 
case.<br><br>The civil liability aspects of this case are another matter.&nbsp; 
Because no reservation of the right to file a separate civil action was made by 
the Batangas City electric light system, the civil action for recovery of civil 
liability arising from the offense charged was impliedly instituted with the 
criminal action both before the City Court of Batangas City and the Court of 
First Instance of Batangas.&nbsp; The extinction of criminal liability whether by 
prescription or by the bar of double jeopardy does not carry with it the 
extinction of civil liability arising from the offense charged.&nbsp; In the present 
case, as we noted earlier,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> accused 
Manuel Opulencia freely admitted during the police investigation having stolen 
electric current through the installation and use of unauthorized electrical 
connections or devices.&nbsp; While the accused pleaded not guilty before the City 
Court of Batangas City, he did not deny having appropriated electric power.&nbsp;

of Article III (22) of the 1935 Constitution was originally introduced by 
Delegate Francisco.&nbsp; The amendment read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Si un acto esta penado tanto por una ley general como por una ordenanza 
municipal, la absolucion o condena bajo la una sera obice para un procesamiento 
ulterior bajo la otra." (IV Proceedings of the Philippine Constitutional 
Convention</em> [1966; S.H. Laurel, Ed.], p. 97)<br><br>Delegate Jose P. Laurel 
speaking in connection with the Francisco amendment said:<br><br>"MR. LAUREL.&nbsp; 
Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention:&nbsp; Pardon me if I have to make a 
little explanation in connection with this case.&nbsp; In the case of the <em>United 
States vs. Grafton</em>, the Supreme Court of the United States said that a 
person accused before a military tribunal and acquitted, cannot again be accused 
before a civil court, because to do so will be to place a person twice in 
jeopardy.&nbsp; In that case, Grafton, who was a soldier was accused before the 
military court.&nbsp; This military court acquitted him.&nbsp; Later on he was again 
prosecuted for the same offense before a civil court, and the civil court 
convicted him to fourteen years, eight months and one day.&nbsp; Upon the appeal to 
the Supreme Court of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court set aside the 
judgment of the lower court on the ground that Grafton had been placed twice in 
jeopardy.<br><br>Now, in connection with my statement regarding laws and 
municipal ordinances, we have in our jurisprudence quite a number of cases, 
particularly the cases of <em>U.S. vs. Joson, U.S. vs. Espiritu Santo </em>and 
other cases holding that the conviction under a general law settled power to 
prosecution (sic) under a local law, and vice versa, <em>on the ground that 
there are two distinct sovereignties and two distinct violations of the 
law</em>.&nbsp; We have, therefore, reached a situation where you have in one case 
the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the decision of our 
Supreme Court in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; Now, the theory in the Supreme Court 
of the United States in the Grafton case was that when the courts acquitted 
Grafton, the acquittal was by the same authority, the authority of the united 
States that established the military court.&nbsp; The civil government was 
established by the same authority of the government of the United States, and 
consequently — to convict a man already acquitted would be [to] place [him] 
twice in jeopardy on the same principle that it was the same authority that 
convicted and condemned Grafton.<br><br><em>Now, the Supreme Court of the 
Philippine Islands, and with due apology to the Supreme Court, failed to follow 
the logic of the Grafton case and adhered to the practice obtaining in several 
states of the Union that in cases where there are two violations, one for a 
general law and one against a local law, there is no double jeopardy on the 
ground of two distinct sovereignties and two distinct laws.&nbsp; But there is no 
doubt that it would be unjust and should not be allowed</em>.&nbsp; <em>The objection 
and the example given here by the Representative from Cebu that a person may be 
influential or may be shrewd enough in case he is accused, for instance, of 
gambling, in hurrying to the chief of police and having him accused of violation 
of a municipal ordinance in which case, according to him, it will not be 
possible to accuse him under a general law, and therefore that will defeat in a 
way the administration of justice because that will make the administration of 
justice dependent upon the ability and the shrewdness of the person accused of 
gambling to hurry to the justice of the peace court.&nbsp; But I desire to inform the 
members of this Convention, in answer to that argument, that in my opinion, it 
is preferable that a man should be only accused and convicted once, for 
instance, for violation of a municipal ordinance and no longer be prosecuted for 
violation of a general law, rather than to permit that same person be convicted, 
say one month in the municipal court and then six months in another court for 
the same offense.</em>&nbsp; I [would] rather see a person convicted once in 
violation of a municipal offense, rather than to permit the conviction of that 
person, one for violation of a municipal ordinance, and one for violation of a 
general law for the same offense, in gambling in that case.&nbsp; If the selection is 
made, I would prefer the prosecution of a man under a general law than to permit 
his prosecution twice for the same act of gambling.<br><br>x x x (IV 
<em>Id.</em>, pp. 113-115; brackets supplied)</p></blockquote>The distinction 
between "acts" and "offenses" in the context of the double jeopardy provision 
was present in the minds of the delegates to the Convention.&nbsp; Thus: "MR. 
LAUREL.&nbsp; Mr. President, that has practically been brought up here, because some 
of our delegates suggested that <em>the word "act" be incorporated, which would 
give rise to difficulties, because one act may constitute different 
offenses.&nbsp;</em> But when we retain the word “offense", there will be distinct 
offenses, and consequently, that may be desirable here to retain what is stated 
in the draft, that is, the word "offense"; but as I said, still if we accept in 
principle the fact that no person shall be prosecuted twice for violation of a 
general offense, or if you give latitude to the Committee as to the form of 
expression, we shall be able to arrive at that point where we can present a 
proper precept embodying the idea that we shall approve in principle only.&nbsp; I am 
not in a position to say now whether it would be advisable to retain it; I do 
not know whether it would be advisable to insert the word "act", because an act 
may constitute several offenses.&nbsp; It seems to me that it is for the committee to 
study properly the draft, and recommend what it thinks best.<br><br>MR. JOVEN.&nbsp; 
Does not the gentleman think that such modification is a question of form and 
not of substance?<br><br>MR. LAUREL.&nbsp; Well, my suggestion that we approve in 
principle the proposition covers this particular case.&nbsp; That is to say, a person 
may not be prosecuted twice in a case where there are two laws, one general law 
and one municipal ordinance.&nbsp; That is to say, in case he is prosecuted under a 
general law, that is a part or the consequences of a municipal ordinance, and 
vice versa.&nbsp; That is the idea, the primary idea, and that is our 
recommendation.&nbsp; Now, as to how we should word it, whether we should retain the 
draft as it is or we shall modify or amplify that and then incorporate the 
amendment suggested by Delegate Francisco, I think it is just a matter of style 
and can be entirely left to the Committee on Style." (IV <em>Id.</em>, pp.

<p><br>"SR. FRANCISCO.&nbsp;<em> Senor Presidente, Caballeros de la convencion, voy a 
ser breve.&nbsp; Yo no estoy conforme con la ultima parte del discurso de mi 
distinguido amigo el Delegado por Batangas, Sr. Laurel, al decir que la frase 
"en ningun caso se pondra a una persona en peligro de ser condenada dos veces 
por el mismo delito", cubre la enmienda que he presentado.&nbsp; La razon es muy 
sencilla.&nbsp; Las palabras "mismo delito" no quieren decir un mismo acto.&nbsp; Esta 
cuestion ha sido planteada ante la Corte Suprema.&nbsp; Al ejecutar un acto penado 
bajo una ordenanza municipal y penado bajo una ley general, se presenta una 
accion contra el en el juzgado de paz.&nbsp; Convicto en el juzgado de paz y firme la 
sentencia, se presenta otra acusacion contra el en el juzgado de Primera 
Instancia por infraccion de una ley general.&nbsp; El acusado se defiende alegando 
que esta en jeopardy, porque ya habia sido condenado por ese mismo acto, y la 
Corte Suprema declaro que la teoria del acusado era erronea, porque dice que lo 
que la ley prohibe es que se ponqa a uno en peligro de ser condenado por un 
mismo delito y no por un mismo acto, y la Corte Suprema declaro, en ese caso 
particular, que como quiera que aquel acto estaba penado nor una ordenanza 
municipal y por una ley general, se cometen dos delitos; uno contra el municipio 
y otro contra el Estado o contra la ley general, de ahi que mi enmienda en el 
sentido de que cuando un acusado ha cometido un acto penado por una&nbsp; ordenanza 
municipal y al mismo tiempo por una ley&nbsp; general, y dicho acusado ya ha sido 
convicto por la infraccion procesado ulteriormente bajo otra ley.&nbsp; Creo, por lo 
tanto, que no es cuestion solamente de estilo, sino que es una cuestion 
fundamental.</em>" (IV Id, p. 119, emphases supplied) </p>
