the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>, <st1:place>Southern
 <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, with the crimes of Robbery in
Band with Less Serious Physical Injuries, docketed therein as Criminal Case No.
R-2894, for the crime committed against <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span>
Fernando; and Robbery in Band with Homicide, docketed therein as Criminal Case
No. R-2895, for the crime committed against <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cualteros</span>, upon the other hand, was acquitted of both
charges on reasonable doubt, but was, nevertheless, ordered to indemnify,
jointly with his co-accused, the offended parties <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span>
Fernando and heirs of <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>
in the amounts stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the death penalty imposed upon each of the accused <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabale</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Daniel, and Benito <span class="SpellE">Terante</span>
in Criminal Case No. R-2895, the records of both Criminal Cases Nos. R-2894 and

rendered therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, upon the
adoption of the 1987 Constitution under which the death penalty is no longer
imposable, the accused, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Daniel, when asked
whether or not he would like to continue with the review of the decision as an
ordinary appeal, informed the Court that he was no longer interested in
pursuing an appeal and that he was willing to serve the reduced penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the judgment against him was considered final.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Since the judgment against the accused <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabale</span> has also become final due to his escape from
detention, only the appeal of the accused Benito <span class="SpellE">Terante</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Bodoy</span> is left for consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Earlier, said accused manifested his desire
to continue and pursue his appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant, Benito <span class="SpellE">Terante</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Bodoy</span>, denied having participated in the
commission of the offenses charged in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>,
and interposed the defense of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, he was in the copra drier, located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Suba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sogod</span>, Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> from 7:00 o'clock in the evening of 7 June 1968,
standing watch over piles of coconuts to be made into copra, together with one <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dugos</span>, until 10 June
1968, when <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>policeman and PC
soldiers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">came </span>and arrested him in
connection with the robberies committed at <span class="SpellE">Magaupas</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He also claims that there was an irregularity in his arraignment
since it was done after the cases had been submitted for decision, so that he
was not afforded the chance to prepare properly for his defense; and that the
prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt since the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mangaring</span>,
Rosita <span class="SpellE">Makiling</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span>
Fernando are not credible in view of the inconsistencies and improba­bilities
in such testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the procedural issue, we find that while the arraignment of the
appellant was conducted after the cases had been submitted for deci­sion, the
error <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>non-prejudicial and has
been fully cured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;position:relative;top:3.0pt;
mso-text-raise:-3.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>where a similar issue was raised, the Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"Counsel for the appellant attacks the proce­dure followed in
the trial already referred where the two accused were arraigned after the
prosecu­tion had rested its case, and he claims that the trial court erred in
considering such evidence, especially since the trial court itself had declared
all the proceedings had before arraign­ment as null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The error, if any, is non-prejudicial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The interests of the appellant have not
suffered thereby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His counsel entered
into trial without any objection on the ground that his client had not yet been
arraigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said counsel cross-examined
the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the fiscal offered to repro­duce all his evidence by presenting again his witnesses,
instead of accepting said offer, he agreed or rather did not object to having
that same evidence for the government declared by the court as reproduced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold that this error or irregularity has
not prejudiced the right or interests of the appellant, and considering that
appellant's counsel had full opportunity of cross-examining all the witnesses
who took the witness stand for the government and that furthermore he agreed to
the reproduction, of the evidence from the prosecution, the error or defect had
been substantially or fully cured."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant cases, counsel for the appellant entered into
trial without objecting that his client, the appellant herein, had not yet been
arraigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said counsel had also the
full opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, when the cases were being retried after
the appellant had been arraigned, appellant's counsel filed a joint
manifestation with the prosecution, adopting all proceedings had previous to
the arraignment of the appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
There was, therefore, no violation of the appellant's constitutional right to
be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot also give weight to the appellant's alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Settled is the rule that for alibi to prosper
as a defense, the accused must prove, not only that he was somewhere else when
the crime was committed, but also that it was impossible for him to be at the
scene of the crime at the time it was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant cases, the appellant failed to
prove his alibi that he was at the copra drier at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Suba</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sogod</span>, <st1:place>Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
when the robberies were committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed to be with one <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dugos</span>
at the time, but he did not present the said <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dugos</span> to corroborate his claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, the appellant also failed to prove that
it was impossible for him to be at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Magaupas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Liloan</span>, <st1:place>Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
at the time the robberies in question were being committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the robberies in
question were committed at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="6">7 June 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the appellant stated that he went to
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Suba</span> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00
 o'clock</st1:time>, there was a time difference of only an hour so that it was
not improbable for the appellant to be at the scene of the crimes at the time
they were being committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the alibi of the appellant cannot prevail over the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Fernando who positively
identified the appellant as one of the four (4) persons who perpetrated the
robberies on the night of <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="6">7 June 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The moon was shining brightly and <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Fernando had ample time and opportunity to observe
the robbers at close range so that he could not have been mistaken in
identifying them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span>
Fernando may not have known their names when the crimes were committed, but he
saw their faces and identified them in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It would also appear that <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Fernando
had no ill-motive to testify falsely against the appellant so that his
testimony is entitled to full weight and credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and
</span>improbabilities in the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution,
pointed out by the appellant, refer to insignificant details which cannot
destroy the credibility of said witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, they have been fully explained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the issue involves the credibility of witnesses and we find no
reason to set aside the findings of fact of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also contends that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">trial court </span>erred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>appreciating
the aggravating circumstance of nighttime in fixing the penalty imposed upon
him in Criminal Case No. R-2894, for Robbery with Less Serious Physical
Injuries, there being no proof that the appellant and his co-accused had
purposely sought the cover of darkness in committing the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While we agree with this contention of the appellant,
the penalty imposed is still correct since there was abuse of superior
strength, without any mitigating circumstance to offset it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The indemnity to be paid to the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>, should, however,
be increased from P12,000.00 to P30,000.00 in line with prevailing
jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> with the modification that the indemnity to be
paid to the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span> is increased to P30,000.00 (from P12,000.00), the
