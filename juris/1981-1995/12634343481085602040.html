<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The accused-appellant
Cecilio Binondo declared that he killed Pat. Domiciano Dinopol in self-defense
and presented his version of what transpired, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">At about 8:00 o’clock in
the evening of February 23, 1986, he, together with his wife, Valentina
Binondo, his son, Rosendo, and Brgy. Councilman Severino Dinopol went to the
house of the spouses Bilanghilot to drink tuba thereat.  They left said house at about 11:00 o’clock
in the evening.  When they were near the
Barangay Health Center of Basak, the victim, carrying a gun with the left hand
and a bolo in his right hand, suddenly emerged from under the mango tree and
approached him in an angry mood at the same time brandishing his bolo </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">if in an act of charging him, saying:  “Why are </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Valentina interceded and tried to pacify Domiciano.  To avoid getting into trouble with the enraged victim, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">opted </span>to walk away from him and
proceeded home with his son Rosendo.  Severino also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">went</span> home
ahead of Valentina.</p>

<p class="BODY">About five minutes after he and Rosendo arrived at their house,
Valentina came gasping for breath telling him to close all windows and doors
because Domiciano was following<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>her
and he said he would kill Cecilia and Rosendo.  Right away he secured the front door, shut off all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lights</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> and</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>got his air

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">companions </span>should Domiciano
carry <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">out </span>his threat.  He <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">also
a</span>sked Rosendo to go upstairs to take care of his (Rosendo) wife and
children on the second storey.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pat. Domiciano Dinopol finally arrived and he tried to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">force open </span>the main door <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">but </span>failed.  He asked Cecilio to come out, shouting:  “Cilio, come <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">out I will
break your </span>head.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Domiciano went towards the kitchen door.  Cecilio, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">on the </span>other
hand, positioned himself in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">dark,
close to </span>the kitchen door, awaiting the attack by Domiciano.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Domiciano </span>forced
open the kitchen door.  When <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he </span>was about<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>to enter with his head protruding inside the kitchen, Cecilia
aimed his rifle at the h<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ead o</span>f<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>Domiciano.  From a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">distance </span>of
about one and one half (1-1/2) feet, he fired the rifle.  When this happened, Domiciano was still
holding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">firearm </span>and his bolo.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a single shot from the air gun, Domiciano turned his head
towards him and aimed his gun at him.  Before Do<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">m</span>iciano could
fire his gun, Cecilio<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>attacked
him with his bolo, his purpose being to let the latter loosen his hold on hi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">s </span>weapons.  This was followed by five or six more strokes on the neck and
body to be sure that Domiciano would drop his weapons.  Domiciano finally dropped <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">his </span>weapons and fell <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>the floor.  Except for the skin on the nape, the head <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>almost severed from the
body.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Knowing Domiciano of having </span>an amulet which could revive him if
his body is doused with water, he finally decided to cut <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">off his head completely.  </span>Imm<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">edi</span>ately thereafter, he carried the victim’s body to the
municipal building and surrendered to the police authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court refused to give credit to his plea of
self-defense and convicted him of murder on the basis of his admission of
killing Domiciano Dinopol.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find this appeal to be without merit and find the defendant’s
plea of self-defense as completely incredible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well entrenched in this jurisdiction is the doctrine that when
the accused admits having killed the victim, but invokes self-dense, the burden
of proving the elements of that defense by clear and convincing evidence lies
with the accused.  To do that, he must
rely on the strength of his evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution.  For<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">even </span>if the
evidence of the prosecution were weak, it may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

killing.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Whether or not appellant acted in self-defense is essentially a
question of fact.  Being so and in the
absence of any showing that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>failed to appreciate facts and
circumstances of weight and substance that would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">have altered its conclusion, the court below, having seen and heard the
witness during the trial, was in a better position to evaluate their
testimonies.  No compelling reason,
therefore, existed for this Court to disturb the trial court’s findings that
appellant did not act in self-­defense.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant did not present clear and convincing
evidence for the court to sustain the claim of self-defense.  The trial court refused to give credence to
accused-appellant’s story that the deceased went to his house purposely to kill
him.  There were no findings that the
victim was guilty of unlawful aggression or unjust provocation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that his story were true, the oral threat made by
Domiciano to kill him unaccompanied by any other unequivocal act clearly
showing his intent to carry out his threat does not constitute unlawful
aggression.  Mere shouting threats and
poundings on the door of the accused?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">appellant’s house were not held by this Court to constitute unlawful
aggression.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> Furthermore, as the accused-appellant
himself testified that he extinguished all sources of light inside the house,
there could not </span>have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">possibly
been any form of attack which may be said to be immediate and imminent from the
victim upon the person of the accused-appellant.  Putting out the lights inside the house threw the house in total
darkness that the victim could not be in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">position to locate him
physically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Not only was there an
absence of unlawful </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">aggression
in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the case at bar, but the
claim of self-defense is likewise negated by the physical evidence.  The accused-appellant suffered no harm or
injury physically.  The number and nature
of the wounds inflicted on the victim proved that if at all, the attack came
from the accused-appellant.  The victim
had no chance to defend himself even if armed.  The medico-legal certificate issued by the municipal health officer
attests to a total of seven wounds all of which were located on the vital parts
of the body.  The means employed becomes
unreasonable and unnecessary when after the aggression had ceased and the
victim no longer posed any threat of further attack, the accused-appellant
continued inflicting injuries on the victim who fell to the ground
helpless.  From his testimony it was
evident that when he delivered the blows with his bolo, he was aiming at his
victim’s body and not simply on the victim’s hand which he claimed was aiming
the gun at him.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> It was also clear that he was aware that his

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The presence of the
qualifying circumstance of treachery was evident from the testimony of the

had enough time to prepare himself, his weapons and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">surroundings </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in a way that he would have the advantage of
position and could deliver the first blow without risk to himself from his
unwary victim.  This he accomplished by
putting off all the lights inside the house and by positioning himself near the
kitchen door where he could not be seen at once.  The accused-appellant employed means, methods or forms in the
execution of the offense which tend directly and specially to insure its
execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended
party might make.  These facts established
by evidence on record clearly constitute treachery, which raised the crime to
murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
