				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In December, 1981, Learjet Phil. Inc. commenced suit in the
Regional Trial Court at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>
against Gates Learjet Corporation and Gates Learjet Export Corporation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On said plaintiff’s application, and upon the posting of an attachment bond in
its behalf by Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation (then known as Phil-Am
Assurance Co., Inc.), the Court issued a writ of preliminary attachment
directed against the defendants' properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the strength of the writ, the sheriff seized a twin engine airplane,
a Learjet 35-A-3799, belonging to the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due proceedings, judgment was rendered by the Trial Court
in plaintiffs' favor, sentencing the defendants to pay US$2,250,000.00 as
actual damages, P200,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary damages,
as well as attorney's fees and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
appeal to the Court of Appeals by the defendants,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
however, this judgment was reversed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
decision of the Appellate Tribunal, promulgated on <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1986</st1:date>, disposed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and
SET <span class="GramE">ASIDE,</span> and Civil Case No. 43874 of the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> is DISMISSED for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the wrongful attachment of
Learjet aircraft 35A?44 owned by defendant-appellant Gates Learjet
Corporation, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Learjet Philippines,
Inc. is hereby ordered to pay to the <span class="GramE">former</span> by way of
actual damages the amount of $73,179.36, P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, and
the costs of the suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 16, 1986, four days after notice of the judgment was
served on the defendants, they filed with the Court of Appeals an "<i>Urgent
Petition to have Damages Awarded on Account of Illegal Attachment Executed
Against Attachment Bond Issued by the Surety Philippine American Assurance Co.,
Inc., Now Pan-Philippines General Insurance Corporation</i>." The petition
adverted to the attachment bond posted by the surety firm in the amount of
P2,000,000.00, and asked that the "damages awarded defendants-appellants
by reason of the wrongful attachment be enforced, after proper notice to
plaintiff and its bondsman and hearing of ** (the) application, jointly and
severally against both the plaintiff and the bondsman-surety **." A copy
of the petition was furnished the surety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff, in its turn, filed a motion for reconsideration of the
decision of <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">By Resolution dated March 10, 1987, the Court of Appeals:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
(1) denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit; and
(2) NOTED "defendants-appellants' application or claim for damages against
the surety” and RESOLVED "<i>to refer the said claim or application to the
trial court and allow the latter to hear and decide the same pursuant to
Section 20, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court</i>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff tried to have the Appellate Court's decision
reviewed and reversed by us, but failed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
We denied its petition for review by resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1987</st1:date>; and entry of the resolution was
made on <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On remand of the case to the Trial Court, the defendants filed an
"<i>Urgent Petition to Have Damages Awarded on Account of Illegal
Attachment Executed Against Attachment Bond Issued by the Surety Philippine
American Assurance Co., Inc., now Pan-Philippines General Insurance Corporation</i>"
dated December 16, 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
ordered execution of the judgment "against the plaintiff at Suite 10 <span class="SpellE">Prescon</span> Strata 100 Emerald Avenue, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Metro Manila" in
accordance with the Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writ
issued on <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the sheriff sought to enforce the writ also against
the surety, "Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation ** (formerly
Pan-Philippines General Insurance Corporation)." Said surety thereupon
filed with the Trial Court an "<i>Urgent Motion to Recall and Nullify
Sheriff's Notice of Enforcement of Writ of Execution, and for Issuance of
Restraining Order/Writ of Preliminary Injunction</i>." It contended that
there was in truth no judgment against it "due to the wrongful attachment
of ** (the defendants') Learjet Aircraft 35A-44," that since neither
Section 20, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court nor the Resolution of the Court of
Appeals of March 10, 1987 had been complied with, there existed no award of
damages against it under its attachment bond, and enforcement of execution
against said bond would be contrary to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court forthwith restrained enforcement of the writ of
execution against the surety and set the surety's motion for hearing in the
morning of <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After receiving the parties’ arguments, the
Court promulgated an Order on <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="6">June 14,
 1988</st1:date> overruling the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> surety's
argument that it (the Court) had lost competence to hear and determine the
application for damages against the attachment bond because the judgment of the
Court of Appeals had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court observed that:</p>

<blockquote>"What is contemplated under Section 20, Rule 57, is that if no
application for damages is made before the entry of the final judgment the
surety on the bond is relieved from liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
Surety and Insurance Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> [85 Phil.
779], citing <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> vs. Tan and <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span>
vs. Lim).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, an
application was made before the entry of final judgment * <span class="GramE">* .</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What was merely deferred was the hearing of
said application before the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, said application was duly noted by the Honorable Court of
Appeals in its resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, an
application for damages was filed in time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the foregoing, and in order to determine the
extent of the liability of both principal and surety on the attachment bond, a
hearing is necessary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The Court also resolved to issue, upon a
bond of P1,000,000.00, a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the
sheriffs from enforcing the writ of execution or otherwise executing the
judgment against the surety "until the application for damages on the
attachment bond is heard and decided;" and set the hearing on the matter
on August 9, 1988.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The surety moved for
reconsideration, but its motion was denied by Order handed down on <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The surety then went to the Court of Appeals again, where it
sought annulment of the Trial Court's Orders of <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1988</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="10">October
 13, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and preliminary injunction, filed on <st1:date year="1988" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1988</st1:date>, was docketed as CA-G.R. No. SP No.
15987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In it the surety argued that it
had been denied its day in court when, without its being present at the trial,
the defendants had "adduced evidence in support of ** (the) damages"
eventually awarded by the Court of Appeals; that said defendants had
"fatally failed to file an application for damages on account of the
wrongful attachment," and consequently, the Court had "no more
jurisdiction to set for hearing ** (the) urgent petition" (to have damages
awarded on account of illegal attachment executed against attachment bond, etc.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court's verdict however again went against the
surety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By Decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1989</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the petition was "DENIED DUE COURSE." According to the Court, (1) the
"general prayer" in the petition (to hold surety liable on its bond)
dated December 16, 1986 "for such further <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
justified in the premises” was "broad enough to include and embrace an
application or claim for whatever damages <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
sustained during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal, by
reason of ** ‘the wrongful attachment **," (2) such a finding was
consistent with "Supreme Court rulings’ and the earlier "Resolution
of March 10, 1987" noting "defendants-appellants' application or
claim for damages against the surety" and referring it "to the trial
court ** pursuant to Section 20, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court;" and (3)
"what must have been contemplated ** (in said application or claim for
damages) were not the damages awarded in CA-G.R. CV No. 08585,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
but the damages which applicants or claimants could have suffered during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of said appeal, as a consequence of the wrongful
attachment found by final judgment," for otherwise "there would have
been no need for this Court to allow and, in effect, direct the trial court <i>a</i>
<i>quo</i> 'to hear and decide' subject post-judgment petition in CA-G.R. CV
No. 08585.” The surety's motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1989</st1:date> was denied by Resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The surety is once again before us,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
this time praying for reversal of the Appellate Tribunal's aforesaid judgment
of <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once again it will fail, no merit being
discerned in its petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">By settled rule a writ of preliminary attachment may issue once
the Court is satisfied, on consideration <i>ex</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>parte</i></span>
of the application and its supporting affidavits and documents,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or after hearing, as the court may in its discretion consider proper, that any
of the grounds specified by law exists, and an acceptable bond is given by the
applicant - <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>" . . . executed to the adverse party in an amount ** fixed by
the judge, not exceeding the applicant's claim, conditioned that the latter
will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the adverse party and all
damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall
finally adjudge that the applicant was not entitled thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The filing of the attachment bond by a
surety undoubtedly connotes and operates as a voluntary submission by it to the
Court's jurisdiction, and of course binds it to faithfully comply with its
specific obligations under its bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The surety does not, to be sure, become liable on its bond simply
because judgment is subsequently rendered against the party who obtained the
preliminary attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The surety
becomes liable only when and if "<i>the court shall finally adjudge that
the applicant was not entitled to the attachment</i>." This is so
regardless of the nature and character of the judgment on the merits of the
principal claims, counterclaims or cross-claims, etc. asserted by the parties
against each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, since an
applicant's cause of action may be entirely different from the ground relied
upon by him for a preliminary attachment,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
it may well be that although the evidence warrants judgment in favor of said
applicant, the proofs may nevertheless also establish that said applicant's <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> ground for attachment was inexistent or specious
and hence, the writ should not have issued at all; i.e., he was not entitled
thereto in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that
event, the final verdict should logically award to the applicant the relief
sought in his basic pleading, but at the same time sentence him -- usually on
the basis of a counterclaim -- to pay damages caused to his adversary by the
wrongful attachment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When the final judgment declares that the party at whose instance
an attachment had issued was not entitled thereto, there is no question about
the eminent propriety of condemning <i>that</i> <i>party</i> to the payment of
all the damages that the wrongful attachment had caused to the party whose
property had been seized under the attachment writ.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">But what of the surety's liability?</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The surety on an attachment bond, as already
pointed out, assures that the applicant "will pay all the costs which may
be adjudged to the adverse party and all damages which he may sustain by reason
of the attachment, <i>if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was
not entitled thereto</i>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words the surety, by submitting its attachment bond, binds itself
solidarity to make the same payments which its principal -- the party at whose
instance the attachment issues -- may be condemned to make, to compensate for
the damages resulting from the wrongful attachment, although unlike its
principal, its liability is limited to the amount stated in its bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The final adjudication "that the applicant was not
entitled" to the attachment, standing alone, does not suffice to make the
surety liable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is necessary, in
addition, that the surety be accorded due process, i.e., that it be given an
opportunity to be heard on the question of its <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
liability for damages arising from wrongful attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, by established rule and practice, is
accorded to the surety at a summary hearing, scheduled after judgment on
presentation of an application to hold it answerable on its bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, such a summary hearing is not
rendered unnecessary or superfluous by the fact that the matter of damages was
among the issues tried during the hearings on the merits, unless of course, the
surety had previously been duly <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as a party,
or otherwise earlier notified and given opportunity to be present and ventilate
its side on the matter during the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The procedure for the rendition of a binding directive on the surety
upon its <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liability for damages for
wrongful attachment is indicated in Section 20, Rule 57 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The section reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 20.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Claim for damages on account of illegal attachment</i>. - If the
judgment on the action be in favor of the party against whom attachment was
issued, he may recover upon the bond given or deposit made by the attaching
creditor, any damages resulting from the attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such damages may be awarded only upon
application and after proper hearing, and shall be included in the final judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The application must be filed before the
trial or before appeal is perfected or before the judgment becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, with due notice to the attaching creditor and
his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to damages
and the amount thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the judgment of the appellate court be favorable to the party
against whom the attachment was issued, he must claim damages sustained during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal by filing an application
with notice to the party in whose favor the attachment was issued or his surety
or sureties, before the judgment of the appellate court becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellate court may allow the application to be heard and decided by the trial
court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Certain principles are derived from this provision of the
Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A party against whom a writ of
preliminary attachment issues may impugn the writ by alleging and proving <i>inter</i>
<span class="SpellE"><i>alia</i></span> that the applicant was not entitled
thereto, i.e., that the asserted ground for attachment was inexistent, or the
amount for which the writ was sought was excessive, etc., this, by appropriate
motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may also claim damages on
account of the wrongful attachment through an appropriate pleading, such as a
counterclaim, or other form of application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What is important is that the "<i>application must be filed before
the trial or before appeal is perfected or before the judgment becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, with due notice to the attaching creditor and
his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to damages
and the amount thereof<span class="GramE">. <span style="font-style:normal">"</span></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, since the Trial Court's decision had gone
against the defendants, and no irregularity had been adjudged as regards the
preliminary attachment, the latter obviously had no occasion to apply for
damages from wrongful attachment -- although they could have so applied <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> because, as already pointed out, it is entirely
possible under the law that an applicant for preliminary attachment be adjudged
<i>entitled to relief on his basic claim </i>and at the same time <i>pronounced
as <u>not</u> entitled to the attachment</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As things turned out, the Trial Court's judgment was reversed by
the Court of Appeals; the latter dismissed the complaint, declared the
plaintiff not entitled to the attachment and sentenced it to pay to the
defendants damages on account thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
it was only at this time that the defendants could have presented and did
actually present their petition to enforce the surety's liability on its
bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This petition, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the Court of Appeals (a) noted and (b)
referred to the Trial Court with instructions "to hear and decide **
pursuant to Section 20, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court." Under the
circumstances, and in the light of the explicit provisions of said Section 20,
Rule 57, there can be no debate about the seasonableness of the defendants'
application for damages and the correctness of the referral by the Court of
Appeals of the application for damages to the Trial Court for hearing and
determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, too, there can be no gainsaying the
surety's full awareness of its undertakings under its bond:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that, as the law puts it:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"the plaintiff will pay all costs which
may be adjudged to the defendant(s), and <i><u>all damages which may be
sustained by reason of the attachment</u></i>, if the same shall finally be
adjudged to have been wrongful and without cause," and that those damages
plainly comprehended not only those sustained during the trial of the action
but also those during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the law,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and this is how the surety's liability should be understood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The surety's liability may be enforced
whether the application for damages for wrongful attachment <span class="GramE">be</span>
submitted in the original proceedings before the Trial Court, or on appeal, so
long as the judgment has not become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The surety's liability is not and cannot be
limited to the damages caused by the improper attachment only during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That would be absurd.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plain
and patent intendment of the law is that the surety shall answer for all
damages that the party may suffer as a result of the illicit attachment, for
all the time that the attachment was in force:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>from levy to dissolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that the attachment was initially (and erroneously) deemed correct by the
Trial Court, and it was only on appeal that it was pronounced improper, cannot
restrict recovery on the bond only to such damages as might have been sustained
during the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The declaration by
the appellate court that the applicant for attachment "was not entitled
thereto," signifies that the attachment should not have issued in the
first place, that somehow the Trial Court had been misled into issuing the writ
although no proper ground existed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The logical and inevitable conclusion is that
the applicant for attachment and the surety on the attachment bond are <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable for <i><u>all</u></i> the damages
suffered by the party against whom the writ is enforced, except only that the
surety's liability is limited to the amount set forth in its bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the second paragraph of the rule speaks only of
"damages sustained during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
appeal" is of no moment; it obviously proceeds from the assumption in the
first paragraph that the award for the damages suffered during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case in the trial court was in fact
"included in the final judgment" (or applied for therein before the
appeal was perfected or the judgment became <span class="SpellE">executory</span>);
hence, it states that the damages <i>additionally</i> suffered thereafter,
i.e., during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal, should be
claimed before the judgment of the appellate tribunal becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
however bears repeating that where, as in the case at bar, the judgment of the
Trial Court has expressly or impliedly sustained the attachment and thus has
given rise to no occasion to speak of, much less, file an application for
damages for wrongful attachment, and it is only in the decision of the Court of
Appeals that the attachment is declared wrongful and that the applicant "<i>was
not entitled thereto,</i>" the rule is, as it should be, that it is entirely
proper at this time for the application for damages for such wrongful
attachment to be filed -- i.e., for <i><u>all</u></i> the damages sustained
thereby, during all the time that it was in force, not only during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the application must be filed "with notice to the party in
whose favor the attachment was issued or his surety or sureties, before the
judgment of the appellate court becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."
In such a situation, the appellate court may resolve the application itself or
allow it "to be heard and decided by the trial court."</p>
