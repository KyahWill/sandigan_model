				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 4, 1970, at about 12:00 noon, on the occasion of a student demonstration being held in the vicinity of Feati University in Sta. Cruz district, Manila, tragedy struck unexpectedly. Francis Sontillano, a 16-year old student of the Philippine Science High School, along with Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad, and Eleuterio Gutierrez, also students of the same school, were hit by a pillbox bomb causing the instantaneous death of Sontillano and physical injuries to the others. <p>On December 14, 1970, an indictment for "Murder with Multiple Attempted Murder" was filed with the Circuit Criminal Court of Manila against Arcadio de la Rosa y Landicho, a security guard of Feati University, charging:</p> <blockquote> <p>"That on or about December 4, 1970, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously treacherously threw a pillbox bomb at the student demonstrators who were then marching along Helios Street, in the Southside of Paterno Bldg., Feati University, in said City, resulting in an explosion, which act was so sudden and unexpected and without giving a chance to the people gathered therein to defend themselves, and as a consequence thereof, it hit one Francis Santillano who sustained mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death thereafter; that as a further consequence of said explosion, the following persons were hit, to wit: Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad and Eleuterio Gutierrez, who likewise sustained physical injuries, but the said accused did not perform all the acts of execution which should have produced the crime of multiple murder as a consequence, by reason of causes other than his own spontaneous desistance, that is the injuries sustained by said Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad and Eleuterio Gutierrez were not necessarily mortal."</p></blockquote> <p>An extensive and speedy trial was conducted. As the People's Brief has adopted as its "own appellant's statement of the case and of the facts that are pertinent to the prosecution, the same being substantially correct," We quote hereunder the evidence of the prosecution and the defense as recited in the latter's Brief, thus:</p> <p>"The prosecution presented both testimonial, documentary and real evidence. For discussion purposes, the prosecution witnesses are grouped into medico-legal officers, police investigators and alleged eyewitnesses. Substantially, their testimonies are as discussed hereunder.</p> <ol><li>Medico-Legal Officers <p>Dr. Luis Larion re-stated and affirmed his findings in his Postmortem Report that Francisco Sontillano suffered, among others, lacerated wound, extensive and avulsing with powder burns and singeing of the hairs located on the vortex of the head with multiple fractures of the skull and maceration of the brain; that the top of the head was blasted down; and that the cause of death was shock and hemorrhage due to explosive blast injuries of the head, fracturing the skull and macerating the brain (pp. 46-55, t.s.n., Larion, January 7, 1971, A.M.; Exh. "M").</p> <p>The formal examinations of Dr. Rodolfo Pineda and Dr. Rodolfo Valera were dispensed with in view of the admission of the defense that Dr. Pineda examined and treated Marlon Fuentes and Ciriaco Lagunsad as indicated in the medical certificates marked as Exhs. "F" and "G", and that Dr. Valera examined and treated Eleuterio Gutierrez as described in the medical certificate marked as Exh. "H" (pp. 109-113, t.s.n., Pineda &amp; Valera, January 5, 1971, P.M.).</p> <p></p> </li><li>Police Investigators <p></p> <ol type="a"><p> </p><li>Jesus Patajo -- <p></p> <p>This witness stated that on December 5, 1970, he received for chemistry examination 11 pieces of CW nails; that he found the nails positive for Nitrates and Nitrites which are probably caused by residues as a result of an explosion; that the nails were negative for Chloride Ions which indicated probable absence of Potassium Chloride which is one of the explosive substances; and that there can be explosion without potassium chloride (pp. 9-18, t.s.n., Patajo, Jan. 5, 1971, A.M.; Exhs. "A", "A-1").</p> <p></p> </li><li>Capt. Raymundo Paredes -- <p></p> <p>The formal presentation of this witness, who would have testified that a pillbox is an explosive and that its explosion could cause injuries like those sustained by Francis Sontillano, was dispensed with in view of the admission of the defense that a pillbox could have caused injuries like those suffered by Sontillano (pp. 56, 57, t.s.n., Manifestation, Jan. 7, 1971, A.M.).</p> <p></p> </li><li>Pat. Alex Querimit -- <p></p> <p>On direct examination, Pat. Querimit of Pct. 2, MPD, claimed that at about 3:00 p.m., December 4, 1970, he, Cpl. Raveno and Pat. Luis Santos, went to the FEATI University compound to investigate a case of homicide with multiple physical injuries due to explosion (pp. 19-21, t.s.n., Querimit, Jan. 5, 1971, A.M.); that at the spot where the violent incident happened, they found and picked up on the asphalted road several pieces of small CW nails (pp. 21, 22, <em>supra</em>, Exh. "A") and that he submitted said nails to the CILAB, MPD for examination (pp. 22-24, <em>supra</em>; Exh. "A-2").</p> <p>On cross-examination, he stated that he saw the nails six (6) feet from the Paterno Building and about a meter from a pool of blood (pp. 27,28, <em>supra</em>; Exh. "1-A"); that at Precinct 2, he interviewed Arthur Romero and submitted the police report marked as Exh. "2" (pp. 28, 30, <em>supra</em>); and that the portion of said report which reads:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"A student witness Arthur Romero y Gondino stated that while he was marching with his fellow students along Helios St., turning at the right south wall of the Paterno Building, he saw a falling object from atop the Paterno Building of Feati University and fell directly on the head of Francis Sontillano which subsequently exploded."</em></p></blockquote> <p>was stated to him by Romero (pp. 30-32, <em>supra</em>; Exh. "2-A").</p> <p></p> </li><li>Pat.

Paterno St., and Rizal Avenue as a suspect in the FEATI case (pp. 35.37, t.s.n., Martinez, Jan, 5, 1971, A.M.); that they asked the accused about the case but he was reluctant to answer and kept shaking his head (pp. 37, 38, <em>supra</em>); that they brought him to Pct. 2 where the accused, after being asked some questions, finally admitted before him (witness), Sgt.

"B"); that the signature above the typewritten name 'ARCADIO L. DE LA ROSA' on page 2 of Exh. "B" was affixed by the accused at Pct. 2 and the other signature above was affixed before Fiscal Guevarra (p. 43, <em>supra</em>); that the accused superimposed the word 'binata' over the word 'may-asawa' on Q. 3 of Exh. "B" (p. 44, <em>supra</em>); that from Fiscal Guevarra they brought the accused to Maj. Castillo, Pct. 2 Commander and then to Mayor Villegas (pp. 44, 45, <em>supra</em>); and in the afternoon of December 5, the accused was brought to the Jose Reyes Memorial Hospital for physical examination (pp. 45, 46, <em>supra</em>). Pat. Martinez claimed that the accused verbally admitted that the pillbox was as big as a balut egg and somebody gave it to him (accused) in the morning of December 4, 1970 (pp. 47, 48, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On cross-examination, this witness stated that they picked up the accused and arrived at Pct. 2 at about 1:30 a.m., (pp. 49, 50, <em>supra</em>); that the accused was not willing to give any answer and continued shaking his head (p. 50, supra); that together with Sgt. Lagasca, Pats. Querol and Basco, they brought the accused to the room of Capt. Crame with no other persons present (pp. 53, 54, <em>supra</em>); that before the accused gave his written statement at 3:00 a.m., he was orally investigated by him and his three companions (pp. 53-54, <em>supra</em>); that he asked all the questions appearing in Exh. "B" and typed the questions and answers thereto (p. 56, <em>supra</em>); that he was aware that the taking of the written statement was during an unholy hour but he could not wait for 6:00 or 7:00 a.m., because he wanted to be through with the investigation (pp. 55, 59, <em>supra</em>); that he conducted an ocular inspection of the FEATI compound and is familiar with the Helios side near the Pasig river and the Paterno building adjacent to the Northern approach of McArthur bridge (pp. 70-73, <em>supra</em>; Exh.

On further cross-examination, Pat. Martinez claimed that it took him about 1 hour to ask preliminary questions (p. 83, <em>supra</em>); that they arrived in Pct. 2 about 1:30 a.m., and the written statement was made at 3:00 a.m., or after 1-1/2 hours (p. 85, <em>supra</em>); that they submitted a report of the investigation but could not locate a copy thereof (p. 96, <em>supra</em>); that he did not include in the report that the accused is left handed (p. 96, <em>supra</em>); that he overlooked to include the questions and answers in the written statement of the accused about the latter's claim as to the size of the pillbox and that the same was given to him (accused) by somebody (p. 99, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On re-direct, examination, the witness claimed that the accused demonstrated in the office how he threw the pillbox by extending the upper torso forward and the left hand throwing a supposed pillbox from left to right making an arc almost overhead (p. 102, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On re-cross examination, Pat. Martinez said that he asked the accused how he threw the pillbox when they were in the investigation room because he considered such question very important but he failed to include that question in accused's written statement (pp. 103, 104, <em>supra</em>); and that the window marked as Exh. "3-C" is the most probable window where the accused threw the pillbox (p. 105, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p></p> </li><li>Pat. Ernesto Querol -- <p></p> <p>On direct examination, this witness claimed that as a member of the Follow-up squad of Pct. 2, MPD, he was informed at about 3:00 p.m. December 4, 1971, by Capt.

Paterno St. and Rizal Avenue and they identified themselves as policemen (pp. 113-116, <em>supra</em>); that they told the suspect about his responsibility for the death of a student but he refused to answer so they took him to the office of Capt.

Castillo in the presence of members of the media and other officers, the accused claimed they usually threw pillboxes during demonstrations to scare demonstrators (pp. 125, 126, supra); that when asked to demonstrate how he threw the pillbox, the accused said that they can ask the police because he had already demonstrated it to them (p. 128; supra). The witness further claimed that from the office of Maj. Castillo they brought the accused to the office of Capt. Crame where they asked the accused to prepare a sketch of the crime scene but accused said he had rather point to the place so at about 11:00 a.m., December 5, 1970, they (accused, Capt. Crame, Sgt. Lagasca, witness, members of uniform patrolmen and other operatives and a photographer) proceeded to the FEATI compound (pp. 2-4, t.s.n., Querol, Jan. 5, 1971, P.M. with Mr. Delim as relief stenographer); that the accused pointed to the place where the victim fell and the window of the second floor of the main building where he threw the pillbox and photographs were taken (pp. 4-6, <em>supra</em>); that at past 12:00 noon, they (accused, Capt.

Querol claimed that he did not know the informant of Sgt. Lagasca and did not bother to inquire about the informant although later he said that he asked for the name of the informer but Sgt. Lagasca did not tell the name (pp. 19-22, <em>supra</em>); that he was told by Sgt. Lagasca that the accused narrated to the informant how he (accused) hurled the pillbox (pp. 25; 26, <em>supra</em>); that they never informed the Fiscal who was the informant to whom the accused confessed (p. 27, <em>supra</em>); that when they apprehended the accused at about 1:00 a.m., the accused remained silent, shook his head, expressly denied having killed the student (pp. 31-33, <em>supra</em>); that they arrived at Pct. 2 about 1:05 or 1:10 and the oral interrogation of the accused lasted for about 2 hours (pp. 34-39, <em>supra</em>); that the accused began to admit when they arrived at Pct. 2 (p. 47, <em>supra</em>); that the accused admitted 30 minutes after arriving at Pct. 2 (p. 47, <em>supra</em>); that minutes after the accused admitted having thrown the pillbox the written statement was taken at about 3:00 a.m. (pp. 53, 54, <em>supra</em>); that Sgt.

Crame claiming that he was an eyewitness to the FEATI incident (pp. 84, 85, <em>supra</em>); that he read on a date he could not remember the portion of the report of Pat. Querimit regarding the claim of Arthur Romero that the pillbox came from atop the Paterno building (Exh. "2-A") but he was not accountable for the version of Romero and it did not occur to him to call up Arthur (pp. 88-92, supra); and it was only on January 3, 1971 that accused was included in a line-up at the City Jail and pointed to by Jose Yambao (p. 93, <em>supra</em>). In answer to the question of the Court, he stated that it was only on January 3, 1971 that Yambao contacted the police precinct (pp. 93, 94, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On re-direct examination, Pat.

"3" (pp. 96-97, <em>supra</em>); and that he was alone when the accused told him that he (accused) smuggled the pillbox inside the FEATI compound (p, 98, <em>supra</em>).

Querol said that he does not know what a watercure is about (p. 102, supra); that it did not occur to him to tell Pat. Martinez about the claim of the accused that he smuggled the pillbox (p. 106, supra); and that they cannot locate Yambao to confront the accused on December 17, 1970 (p. 108, supra).</p></li></ol> <p></p> </li><li>Alleged Eye-Witnesses <p></p> <ol type="a"><p> </p><li>Arthur Romero -- <p></p> <p>On direct examination this witness stated that on December 4, 1970, he and about 50 students of the Philippine Science High School (PSHS) joined a rally of students (pp. 117-119, t.s.n., Romero, Jan. 5, 1971, P.M.); that at about 12:45 p.m., the rallyists numbering about 5,000 passed through the FEATI University along Helios St. (PP. 121-122, <em>supra</em>); that they, were at the tail of the demonstrators with Francisco Sontillano ahead of him by about 1 to 2 meters (pp. 123, 124, <em>supra</em>); that he also noticed Marlon Fuentes, Eleuterio Gutierrez and Ciriaco Lagunsad in their march which was generally peaceful (pp. 125, 126, <em>supra</em>); that as they entered the FEATI compound and were about to pass under the McArthur bridge he saw a bomb, travelling at a fast speed which he could not describe nor ascertain from what direction it came from although he noticed it when it was exactly over the head of Sontillano (pp. 127, 128, <em>supra</em>); that the bomb exploded over the head of Sontillano who fell to the ground with the brain scattered out (pp., 128-131, <em>supra</em>); that with four other companions including Julius Ferrare who was wounded, they went to a nearby store (pp. 129, 130, <em>supra</em>); that some students brought Sontillano in a taxi to Pct. 2 (p. 131, <em>supra</em>); that after about 30 minutes they were invited to go to Pct. 2 where he was investigated and gave a written statement to the police (pp. 130-132, <em>supra</em>). On additional direct examination, Romero claimed that he does not know the color of the object that fell on Sontillano's head because it travelled so fast and he saw it about 1 foot from Sontillano's head (pp. 7, 8, t.s.n., Sontillano, Jan. 7, 1971, <em>supra</em>); and that the sound of the explosion resembled the blast of pillboxes which he heard on previous occasions (p. 9, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On cross-examination, Romero admitted that the sworn statement marked as Exh. "4" was executed by him at 2:45 p.m., December 4, 1970 and that he was re-affirming under oath the truth of the answer thereon (pp. 10-13, t.s.n., Romero, Jan. 7, 1971, A.M.). Confronted with the portion of his statement which was marked as Exh. "4-A", to wit:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"T.</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Nakita mo ba naman kung saan nagbuhat iyong bagay na pumutok?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"S.</td> <td> <div align="justify">Nagbuhat ho sa itaas ng building ng Feati University at isa hong pillbox."</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote> <p>Romero claimed that his answer was merely a presumption that the object came from the top of any of the buildings of FEATI University (pp. 13-16, <em>supra</em>); that he is a Tagalog but did not state 'Nagbuhat ho sa itaas ng alinmang sa mga building ng Feati University' because he was then confused and he even informed the police investigator about his confusion and asked for the postponement of his statement but the police officers said that it will not harm him anyway (pp. 15-17, <em>supra</em>); that he was not sure whether he told the policeman, 'Nagbuhat ho sa itaas ng building,' although he subsequently admitted that he told the investigator 'Nagbuhat ho sa itaas ng Feati Building' (p. 22, <em>supra</em>); that the following question and answer were made during the investigation -- "T- Nakikilala mo ba naman kung sino iyong nagtapon ng pillbox buhat sa itaas ng Feati Building? S- Hindi ho, sa mga taong nagbato sa galit ay maaaring makilala iyon." (p.20, <em>supra</em>; Exh. "4-B"); that before signing his statement he read it and even told the police investigator that he was still confused and had rather not sign it but the investigator said it will not harm him anyway (p. 23, <em>supra</em>); that he read again Exh. "4" only when he was under cross-examination (January 7, 1971) and that he never talked to any policemen about the incident except when he gave his statement on December 4, 1970 (pp. 26, 27, <em>supra</em>); that Sontillano fell down right at the place where he was hit (p. 30, <em>supra</em>); that he could not remember whether the object was 1 foot directly on top, back, front or side of the head of Sontillano (p. 31, <em>supra</em>); and that there were about 30 to 50 students behind him (p. 37, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On re-direct examination, Romero said that the explosion caused momentary blindness (p. 38, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On re-cross examination, Romero said that he can now remember that the explosion was on top of the head of Sontillano (p. 39, <em>supra</em>); that the explosion was 1 foot from the head and not on top of the head of Sontillano (p. 40, <em>supra</em>); and later on claimed that the explosion was on top of the head but not one foot from the head of Sontillano (p. 41).</p> <p></p> </li><li>Eleuterio Gutierrez -- <p></p> <p>On direct examination, this witness claimed that he knows Francis Sontillano, Ciriaco Lagunsad, Marlon Fuentes and Arthur Romero who are also students of the PSHS (p. 4, t.s.n., Gutierrez, Jan. 8, 1971); that at about 12:45 p.m., December 4, 1970, he was with some of his schoolmates, particularly Sontillano, Fuentes and Lagunsad in a demonstration sympathizing with students who were not admitted in their schools (pp. 3-7, supra); that while walking towards.

"3-B"); that at the FEATI building, he saw a man, the only person in that place, throwing with his left hand an object towards the McArthur bridge which hit a group of students and exploded (pp. 66-72, 77, 78, <em>supra</em>; Exhs. "3-D", "E"); that said person threw the object by swinging his left hand from left to right making an arc over his head and his torso extended outwards (pp. 72-75, <em>supra</em>); that said person, who was wearing a white T-shirt with a black neckline and about 50 paces away, left the place after throwing the object (pp. 75, 76, <em>supra</em>); that the students scampered away and a man lying flat on his stomach on the road side with a pool of blood near his head was left behind (pp. 78, 79, <em>supra</em>); that after a while people converged on the person lying on the ground (p. 79, <em>supra</em>); that after the incident, he did not have a chance to go to the police (p. 80, <em>supra</em>); that he thought somebody, among the many witnesses, would have reported the matter to the police and he read in the Saturday newspapers that the culprit admitted his guilt (p. 81, <em>supra</em>); that on December 6, 1970, his conscience prompted him to go to the police to tell them what he saw (p. 85, <em>supra</em>); and that the person who threw the object, which was as big as a duck egg, was the accused Arcadio dela Rosa (pp. 84, 85, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On cross-examination, Yambao stated that he is a high school graduate residing in Makati, Rizal (p. 89, <em>supra</em>); that on December 4, 1970, he walked from the Congress of the Philippines towards Echague where he was to board the buses going to Makati (pp. 90, 91, <em>supra</em>); that he used to ride in Echague because it is cheaper there (p. 92, <em>supra</em>); that he had no money and it would cost him more had he taken the bus at Plaza Lawton instead of Echague which is only P0.20 (p. 94, <em>supra</em>); that he knew he could take a bus or a jeep near the back of YMCA but he did not do so because sometimes he could take a free ride on the B-Twelve buses although he was not able to get a free ride on that day (p. 96, <em>supra</em>). On the resumption of the cross-examination, he admitted that buses going to Makati coming from Echague pass the corner of San Marcelino and Ayala and that the distance from Congress to the corner of San Marcelino and Ayala is very much shorter than from Congress to Echague (pp. 3-4, t.s.n., Yambao, Jan. 7, 1971, P.M.); that he went to Congress on that day to look for his sister and stayed there up to 12:00 noon without taking his lunch (p. 5, <em>supra</em>); that he arrived at McArthur bridge past 12:30 p.m., December 4, 1970, and stayed on the bridge for about 15 minutes (p. 5, <em>supra</em>); that he is not living with his wife and children in Makati but is living with the family of his nephew (pp. 9, 10, <em>supra</em>); that he stayed at home the rest of day and talked to his niece (nephew's wife) about family matters and did not tell her about what he saw an hour ago (pp. 11, 12, <em>supra</em>); that he did not see whether the skull of the person hit was blown off nor whether he had a wound on the head (p. 13, <em>supra</em>); that from where he stood, he saw only about 100 students although in his sworn statement marked as Exh. "5" in answer to Q-10, he claimed having seen 500 students (pp. 15, 16, <em>supra</em>; Exh. "5-A"); that he was sure that the object which he saw was black and the size of a duck egg although in answer to Q-22 of Exh. "5", he said that the object was 'makintab po na maputi-puti' (p. 19, <em>supra</em>); that he was sure there were no other persons at the FEATI building aside from the accused although in answer to Q-13 of Exh. "5", he said that 'Doon po sa building na katabi ng tulay ay wala pong lumabas na tao, pero mayroon pong mga bato at tote na lumalabas sa bintana na tumama sa ibaba. Doon po katapat na building na bukas ang mga bintana ay mayroon ding mga taong mambabato doon sa mga estudiante sa ibaba' (pp. 21, 22, <em>supra</em>; Exh. "5-C"); that he cannot remember how many were the persons at the FEATI building (p. 26, <em>supra</em>); that students were throwing stones towards the upper portion of Paterno building and bottles and stones were coming from said building (pp. 27, 28, <em>supra</em>); that he was standing about 5 meters (per demonstration of witness) from a lamp post towards Plaza Goiti (p. 29, <em>supra</em>); that before leaving the place people converged around the area with some of them in khaki, but he was not sure whether there were policemen (pp. 30, 31, <em>supra</em>); that when confronted with his statement in Exh. "5", re Q-29 that 'Matagal-tagal pa po bago nilapitan ng mga tao. Nang mayroon ng dumating na Pulisya at iba pang mga tao at doon din mismo sa tulay ay marami ng nanonood, ako po ay umalis na,' he was constrained to admit there were policemen who arrived at the scene of the incident where a person laid sprawl on the ground (p. 32, supra); that it did not occur to him to tell the policemen what he saw because there were many other eye-witnesses although he did not see anybody volunteering the information to the police (pp. 32, 33, <em>supra</em>); that he read the Taliba issue of December 5, 1970 which reads: 'Iniutos ni Major Castillo kay Capt. Francisco Adolfo ang paggawa ng masugid na pagsisiyasat upang malaman kung sino ang naghagis ng 'pillbox' mula sa gusali ng Feati' (Exh. "6-A") which clearly showed that nobody has been suspected yet, still he (witness) did not report to the police (pp. 35-37, <em>supra</em>); that it was only when he found out that the suspect did not admit his guilt that he decided to go to the police (p. 36, <em>supra</em>); that he used to be a prison guard of the Bureau of Prisons and was exonerated of the administrative charge of maltreatment of prisoners (p. 39, <em>supra</em>); that as a fireman of the Manila Fire Department he was separated from the service because he was sickly for having exceeded his absence (p. 39, <em>supra</em>); that when he reported to the police, he was asked to demonstrate how the person threw the object he previously described as 'maputi-puti' which he later described as 'maitim' (pp. 40, 41, <em>supra</em>); and that when he was being investigated on December 6, 1970, he was not asked to, demonstrate how the person threw the object (p. 41, <em>supra</em>)</p> <p>At this juncture, the defense petitioned for an ocular inspection of the place of the incident and the same was granted. At the McArthur bridge, on the right side going to Sta. Cruz, witness pointed to the lamp post of McArthur bridge where he testified to in court as the place where he was allegedly standing on December 4, 1970 (p. 45, supra). Five (5) meters from said lamp post towards Plaza Goiti where Yambao said he was at the time of incident was measured and from that place the window of the FEATI building from where the accused allegedly threw a pillbox could not be seen as the view is obstructed by the Paterno building (p. 50, supra). Noticing the physical impossibility of seeing the window of FEATI building, witness moved in the opposite direction to about 5 meters away from the lamp post towards Plaza Lawton and pointed to it as the place where he was standing (p. 47, <em>supra</em>). From this newly pointed position, the distance to the place pointed to where Sontillano fell is about 15 meters directly oblique if facing directly the side of the bridge and about 50 meters to the first window of the second floor of the FEATI building where the accused was allegedly seen (pp. 47, 48, <em>supra</em>). On the electric post near the FEATI building are 2 big cable wires and 6 transformers of about 4" by 6" (p. 48, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>From McArthur bridge the parties went to Helios St. at the side of McArthur bridge. Yambao pointed to the place where he claimed Sontillano fell which was 41 feet from the side of McArthur bridge and 13 feet from the wall of Paterno building (pp. 51, 52, <em>supra</em>). The actual measurement by the police investigators at the scene of crime immediately after the incident -- 16 feet from the side of McArthur bridge and 6 feet from the wall of the Paterno building -- was also plotted on the ground (pp. 52, 53, <em>supra</em>). The place indicated by Yambao grossly differed from that officially reported by the police by as much as 25 feet from the side of McArthur bridge and 7 feet from the wall of the Paterno building (p. 53, <em>supra</em>). From the spot where the victim fell per the police report, the window at the FEATI building pointed to by the witness as the place where the accused was could not be seen (p. 53, <em>supra</em>). Yambao said that he cannot tell the position of the body (p. 54, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>The parties then proceeded to the first window of the second floor of the FEATI building where the Honorable Presiding Judge threw (3) stones towards McArthur bridge with the first stone hitting the window of Paterno building, the second stone about 8 meters short of the spot where victim allegedly fell according to Yambao and the third Stone hitting a car parked in front of the Paterno building and short by 5 meters from the spot pointed to by Yambao (pp. 55, 56, <em>supra</em>). From the first open window of the second floor of the FEATI building, the place on the bridge where Yambao previously, testified to in court as the spot he was standing (5 meters from lamp post towards Plaza Goiti) could not be seen although the place Yambao subsequently pointed to when he was already on the scene of the incident could be seen (p. 60, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On re-direct examination, Yambao said that when he saw the accused throwing the object there were no other persons (p. 61, <em>supra</em>).</p></li></ol></li></ol> <ol start="2" type="A"><li>Evidence-in-Chief of the Defense <p>The accused testified in his own behalf.

Martinez sat on his stomach facing him and as Pat. Martinez held his two hands, his face was covered by a dirty shirt with an odor that caused his tears to fall (pp. 68, 69, supra); that as they poured water on his face which entered his nose and as he could not breathe, Sgt.

"0" shows the accused pointing with his right forefinger the spot below where Sontillano was standing at the time he was hit by the pillbox (pp. 28, 29, <em>supra</em>); and that Exh. "0-1" also showed the accused pointing with his left hand to the place where victim was standing when hit (p. 29, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On re-cross examination, he said that the pictures marked as Exh. "3" was shown to him only but was taken by MPD photographer (pp. 30-32, <em>supra</em>); that they instructed the photographer to take the picture of the spot where the victim fell but according to the photographer the negative was exposed (p. 33, <em>supra</em>); that he did not take steps to retake the demonstration of the accused as he threw the pillbox and the place where victim fell after being notified of the exposure (p. 33, <em>supra</em>); that he refers only to Exh. "0-1" as the picture where the accused pointed to the place where the victim fell (p. 34, <em>supra</em>); that the accused was at the main annex at the time he was pointing to the place where victim fell (p. 35, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p></p> </li><li>Bobby Castro— <p></p> <p>This witness claimed that he was one of those who demonstrated along FEATI University when Sontillano died (p. 37, t.s.n., Castro, Jan. 13, 1971); that it is not true that a pillbox was recovered within his vicinity (p. 38, <em>supra</em>); that he never gave his name as Robert Castro because his real name is Bobby Castro (p. 39, <em>supra</em>); that there were many policemen and news reporters then and he was asked about his name (p. 40, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p>On cross-examination, he said that he does not know where the pillbox was recovered (p. 42, <em>supra</em>); and that he never saw the policemen recovering a pillbox after the commotion (p. 42, <em>supra</em>).</p></li></ol> <p></p> </li><li>Rebuttal Evidence of the Defense— <p></p> <p> </p><ol><li>Nilda Caracas— <p></p> <p>On direct examination, Miss Caracas testified that she knew Pat.

Pelayo was not at the base of the stairways near the iron gate between 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on December 4, 1970, because she never saw him there when she went out to buy soap at past 9:00 a.m., and then returned to the house (p. 45, <em>supra</em>); that Pat. Pelayo was likewise not at the gate when she again went out about 10:00 a.m. to buy viands and returned to the house (p. 47, <em>supra</em>); that from the door of her place she could see the iron gate where Pelayo claimed he was but she never saw him there between 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. of said date (p. 47, <em>supra</em>); that on December 6, 1970, Mrs. Pelayo informed r that Pat. Pelayo and the family went to Candaba on December 4, 1970 (p. 47, <em>supra</em>); that after December 6, 1970, Pat. PeIayo told her to help the accused if she knew he is innocent but not to help him if she knew he is guilty (p. 48, <em>supra</em>); and that Pat. Pelayo never mentioned anything about the accused having been in her house (pp. 49, 50, <em>supra</em>). On cross-examination, she said that her house companion on December 4, 1970 was Delarose Acosta (p. 51, <em>supra</em>).</p></li></ol></li></ol> <p>On February 13, 1971, the trial court found the accused guilty of the complex crime of murder with multiple attempted murder and sentenced him to death, the dispositive portion of the decision reading as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"WHEREFORE, accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the complex crime of murder with multiple attempted murder qualified by the use of explosive and there being proved the aggravating circumstance of treachery without any mitigating circumstance to effect the same, the court sentences him to DEATH, to indemnify the heirs of the victim Francis Sontillano the sum of P12,000.00 for the death of the latter and the sum of P10,000.00 by way of moral damages, also the sum of P5,000.00 each to victims Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad and Eleuterio Gutierrez by way of moral damages and to pay the costs.</p> <p>SO ORDERED.</p> <p>Manila, Philippines, February 13, 1971.</p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="65%">&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">(SGD.)

"M"); (2) The results of the examinations and treatment by Dr. Rodolfo Pineda and Dr. Rodolfo Valera of victims Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad and Eleuterio Gutierrez as indicated in the medical certificates marked as Exhibits "F", "G" and "H", respectively (t.s.n., pp. 109-113, Pineda and Valera, January 5, 1971, P.M.); (3) The testimony of police investigator Jesus Patajo that he found the "pieces of CW nails, which he received for chemistry examination, positive for Nitrates and Nitrites which are probably caused by residues as a result of an explosion (t.s.n., pp. 9-18, Patajo, January 5, 1971, A.M., Exhs. "A" &amp; "A-1"); and (4) The supposed testimony of Captain Raymundo Paredes which was dispensed with in view of the admission that a pillbox could have caused injuries like those suffered by Sontillano.</p> <p>The crucial question to be resolved herein is whether or not the evidence against accused Arcadio dela Rosa as the pillbox bomb thrower is so positive and certain as to meet the inflexible requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p>The theory of the prosecution is that the accused-appellant, standing at the first open window of the second floor of the Feati building, threw a pillbox towards McArthur bridge which hit a group of students marching along Helios Street, between Paterno building and Pasig River. In support of this theory, the prosecution relies on the testimony of the alleged witness, Jose Borbon Yambao, and on the alleged voluntary confession of the accused.</p> <p>On the other hand, the position of the defense is that the above theory of the prosecution is a physical impossibility; that the accused was not at the Feati University at the time of the incident; that the claim of the police investigators that the accused voluntarily executed his confession is a blatant and calous lie and that Yambao is a last-minute fabricated witness who was recruited to repair the damage caused by the accused's repudiation of the alleged confession, and that therefore, the accused is entitled to an acquittal.</p> <p>On the alleged physical impossibility for the victim Francis Sontillano to have been hit by a pillbox allegedly thrown from the first open window of the second floor of the Feati building which accused-appellant contends and submits as the first assigned error on the part of the lower court in not so finding, We find that indeed, the evidence on records shows that the spot where Sontillano fell is disputed. From the report of Pat. Querimit (last paragraph, p. 2, Exh. 2, p. 66, Records) Sontillano fell on that portion of Helios Street between Paterno Building and Pasig River which is approximately six (6) feet from the south wall of the Paterno Building and about sixteen feet from the east wall of the north approach of the McArthur Bridge. But as pointed out by prosecution witness Jose Yambao (pp. 51-52, t.s.n., Jan. 7, 1971, P.M., Perez) it is that place thirteen feet from the south wall of Paterno building and forty one (41) feet from the east wall of McArthur bridge. The trial court adopted the latter place as the spot where the victim, Francis Sontillano, fell.</p> <p>In arriving at this conclusion, the court cited the ocular inspection of the premises, the observation of the Presiding Judge and his participation therein, among others, as the basis of said conclusion, in the following excerpts:</p> <blockquote> <p>". . . accused claimed that it was physically impossible for the object to be hurled at the first window of the second floor of the Feati Building to the spot where Sontillano fell, because of the obstruction of the object hurled by a portion of the Paterno Building which is separated from the Feati Building by Helios Street. That defense, however, of the accused has no merit. From the common exhibit of the prosecution and the defense (Exhibit "3"), it is clear that if a straight line is drawn from the place where the accused threw the pillbox (Exhibit "C") to the place where Sontillano fell (Exhibit "2-C"), that portion of the Paterno Building will not obstruct the pillbox thrown. In the ocular inspection, the court has likewise observed that an object thrown, from the place where the accused was (Exhibit "C") to the place where the victim fell (Exhibit "3-C"), will not be obstructed by that portion of the Parterno Building, the post, the wires and the transformers especially the light of the testimony of Yambao that when accused threw the pillbox, accused made an upward swing of his hand from the left to the right. The Presiding Judge even got stones and threw them upward passing over the wires and transformers and though the third throw fell short of about five meters from the place where the victim fell, yet, it is clear that with the necessary strength of the thrower, it will reach the place where the victim fell without any obstruction." (Decision, pp. 255-256, original records).</p></blockquote> <p>We agree with the trial court that the testimony of Jose Yambao who witnessed the incident when it happened is more reliable than the report of Pat. Querimit (Exh. "2") who went to the scene to investigate when it was already 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon some three hours after the incident which occurred at about 12:00 o'clock noon of December 4, 1970 as well as the testimony of Evening News photographer Luciano Caliwan who arrived at the scene an hour after the incident. Both Patrolman Querimit and photographer Caliwan were not present when the explosion occurred and neither did they see Francis Sontillano as he lay sprawled on the road after the explosion. At most, the report of the patrolman and the testimony of the photographer indicated an estimated measurement of what they thought to be the spot where the victim fell.</p> <p>The insistence of the defense that the physical impossibility for a pillbox thrown from the first open window of the second floor of Feati Building to have hit Sontillano at the place claimed by the defense and the strong probability that the pillbox came from the top of the Paterno Building is shown by the claim of witness Arthur Romero, immediately after the fatal incident, that he saw a falling object coming from atop the Paterno Building which fell directly on the head of Sontillano, cannot be accepted in the light of the clarification made by the same witness, Arthur Romero, when confronted in court that he did not immediately see where the pillbox came from because when he saw it, the object was already on top of the head of the victim, Francis Sontilano, and the falling object was then exploding. When this witness reported to Pat. Querimit that the object came from atop the Paterno Building, he clarified that his reference to the Paterno Building as to where the object came from was merely presumed by him. Such explanation or clarification is natural and logical, consistent with human conduct and reaction to unusual occurrences such as the explosion of the pillbox that hit the head of the victim in the case at bar. The first circumstance that must have attracted the attention of the witness, Arthur Romero, was the nearness of the falling object to the head of the victim, followed by the explosion. At any rate, the point at issue is one of credibility where the conclusion of the trial court that heard the evidence is conclusive and binding upon this Court.</p> <p>The second assigned error faults the lower court in not disregarding the testimony of the principal prosecution witness, Jose B. Yambao, which the defense brands as clearly and obviously fabricated on the grounds that he has an "untrustworthy background"; that Yambao was not at the scene of the crime; that his claim that he passed by McArthur Bridge on his way home is incredible; that Yambao's claim that he recognized the accused dela Rosa shows propensity for falsehood; that his failure to immediately report to the police raises grave doubts on his claim; and that said witness Jose Yambao made self-contradictions and inconsistencies in his affidavit and his testimony in court. This assignment of error is not impressed with merit.</p> <p>Reviewing the grounds set forth above submitted by the accused-appellant in support of the second assignment of error, it is at once apparent that they all raised the question of credibility of the evidence presented in the trial of the case which, as We have pointed out earlier, the lower court being in a better position to appreciate the same, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their behavior and manner of testifying, is entitled to respect. Nonetheless, this being an automatic review of the decision imposing the death penalty, We hold that Yambao's credibility as a witness is not impaired by his inability to reply to certain administrative charges filed against him for prolonged absence without leave and deliberate failure to submit his reply, nor by a recommendation of the board of officers of the New Bilibid Prison that Yambao as prison guard be reprimanded for having maltreated prisoners on several occasions.</p> <p>Appellant's contention that Yambao was not at the scene of the crime because of alleged contradiction in the latter's testimony on cross-examination that he was standing about five (5) meters from a lamp post on McArthur Bridge towards Plaza Goiti while during the ocular' inspection, Yambao pointed to the lamp post of said bridge and that five (5) meters from said lamp post towards. Plaza Goiti was actually measured and from that position, the Feati building where Yambao allegedly saw the accused throw a pillbox could not be seen inasmuch as the view is completely obstructed by the Paterno Building, is weak and flimsy. The observation of the lower court that Yambao, did not say that he was five, meters away from the post after passing it, is to Us, logical. We find no conflict in the statement of Yambao during the ocular inspection that he was standing five meters away before the post on the McArthur bridge coming from Plaza Lawton and his testimony in court prior to the ocular inspection that he was five meters away from the post towards Plaza Goiti for in the first instance, he was coming from Plaza Lawton and in the second, he was at the same time going towards Plaza Goiti. In any event, as the trial court correctly held, which We affirm, persons are easily liable to commit errors in the observation recollection of minute details of an important occurrence (People <em>vs</em>. Tuazon, 1717334 April 29, 1950, 86 Phil. 278).</p> <p>We also reject appellant's submission that Yambao's account is too fantastic to believe not only because it is a gratuitous assertion but also because it has no sound factual basis is against the positive and credible testimony of this witness. More than that, it is of common observation that ordinary, citizens like the witness; Jose Yambao, are reluctant to come 'forward and report to the police authorities to volunteer information that will involve them in court cases. And moreover, whatever inconsistencies or contradictions which the appellant have pointed in his Brief to impugn the credibility of witness Yambao ware sufficiently explained and clarified by said witness. Anyway, the inconsistencies are trivial and as We said in <em>People vs. Alcantara</em>, L-26867, June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA 812, "The contradictions in the declarations of a witness when trivial cannot be ascribed to insidious attempt to distort the truth. It is a truism that the must candid witness oftentimes commits mistakes and incure in inconsistencies in his declarations, but such honest lapses do not necessarily impair his intrinsic credibility. Far from being evidence of falsehood they could justifiably be regarded as a demonstration of good faith and a confirmation of the fact that the witness was not a rehearsed witness."</p> <p>Accused-appellant attacks the admissibility of the extrajudicial confession, Exhibit "B" given by him on December 5, 1970 to Pat. R. Martinez in the Office of the Follow-up Unit, Pct. 2, MPD on the ground that it was involuntary, having been secured by means of force, threats and intimidations.

We need not repeat them here. The accused, however, stresses in his Brief that the categorical testimony of maltreatment is borne out by the evidence on record; that the spontaneous complaint of the accused upon seeing his counsel clearly shows involuntariness of confession; that the unholy hour of investigation is consistent with the testimony of the accused as to his maltreatment; that the alleged demonstration by the accused is a deliberate falsehood; that the claim that said accused is left-handed is a blatant lie intended to jibe with the fabricated theory of the police and that the gross inconsistencies of the police investigators surrounding the alleged confession show use of force, threats and intimidation. Accused-appellant further scores the failure of the police to present the alleged informant and that the police investigators had strong motive to pervert the truth.</p> <p>Rejecting the defense's claim of involuntariness, the trial court said no evidence was presented by the accused to corroborate the fact of maltreatment; that the statement of the accused is replete with details which could be known to the accused alone and for which the police officers could not be much interested or could not have actually known them, like for example, that the students were shouting and stoning the rooms of the students in the Paterno building and the new main building, slandering the security guards, and shouting that the students boycott their classes; that he saw his companions Ambrosio Pechardo and one Cruz of the Tamaraw guard were injured; that the windows of the Feati University were destroyed; that they threw the pillbox to scare off the student demonstrators; and that he was in the second floor of the new main building at the end portion fronting Helios Street. The answers in his statement were even responsive and informative. The statement itself does not show on its face any suspicious circumstance indicating irregularity.</p> <p>This conclusion of the trial court is correct and We affirm the same. For the rule is well-settled that where on its face a confession exhibits no sign of suspicious circumstances tending to cast doubt on its integrity or is replete with details which could possibly be supplied only by the defendant and the response to every question is so fully informative even beyond the requirements of the question as to indicate the mind to be free from extraneous restraints, the confession is considered to have been voluntarily given. This is the doctrine in <em>People vs. Tia Fong</em>, 98 Phil. 609; <em>People vs. Dorado</em>, 30 SCRA 53; <em>People vs. Casillar</em>, 30 SCRA 352; <em>People vs. Pingol</em>, 33 SCRA 73, followed by a long line of cases, the most recent of which are the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Where the statement of the accused mentions details which only the declarant could have furnished and could not have been concocted by the investigator, the confessions considered to have been voluntarily given. (People <em>vs</em>. Barrios, L-34785, July 30, 1979, 92 SCRA 189).</p> <p>"Details disclosed in the confession which could have been known only by the declarant indicate the voluntariness in executing the same, (People <em>vs</em>. Bautista, L-31900, Aug. 6, 1979, 92 SCRA 465).</p> <p>"Plea that extrajudicial confession was involuntary was not given credence as same is full of details that only accused could have known. (People <em>vs</em>. Beralde, L-32832, June 20, 1979; People <em>vs</em>. Ty Sui Wong, L-32529, May 12, 1978).</p> <p>"Extrajudicial confession by the accused were voluntarily executed where confessions themselves are indicative of spontaneity and truth. (People <em>vs</em>. Toling, No. 28548, July 13, 1979, 91 SCRA 382)."</p></blockquote> <p>It was also emphasized by the trial court that the extrajudicial confession of the accused was not only subscribed but signed again before Inquest Fiscal Donato Guevarra, who, while testifying as witness of the accused, declared that it is his practice to require a person brought before him to sign again in his presence, so that accused signed again above his first signature; that as witness for the accused, Fiscal Guevarra did not testify to any irregularity in the taking of the statement of the accused. Moreover, the accused was even brought before Mayor Villegas and in the presence of several members of the press, he was asked by the Mayor whether he was the one who threw the pillbox and he answered "Yes." The Mayor even asked him whether he knows that the penalty for what he did is death and the accused said that he is ready for that. The accused never denied this.</p> <p>We agree with the trial court in considering the above circumstances, among others, as indicative of the voluntariness of the confession, much more so when the verbal admission of the accused before the Chief Executive of the City with members of the press in attendance, reiterated his commission of the crime as written in the extrajudicial confession, Exhibit "B". For there is overwhelming jurisprudence that "the failure of the accused to complain to the Municipal Judge that he was forced to sign his confession which only the accused could have supplied negates the claim that the said confession was extracted from him through force and intimidation" (People <em>vs</em>. Abalos, 57 SCRA 330); that the presumption of voluntariness in the execution of the confession was not overcome when it was replete with facts which could possibly be supplied only by the accused and that they substantially interlock, confirming each other as the detail and that the alleged maltreatment was not denounced when the confession was sworn to before the Fiscal (People <em>vs</em>. Casillar, 30 SCRA 352; People <em>vs</em>. Pareja, 30 SCRA 693); that where appellant signed his extrajudicial confession in the presence of police officers and two newspapermen and thereafter brought before the City Fiscal where he affirmed the same, signing it once more and he has not presented any medical certificate to prove any injury received by him during the process of taking the confession, his claim that he was maltreated and forced into executing the confession cannot be given credence (People <em>vs</em>. Reyes, 17 SCRA 279).</p> <p>Indeed, We find that the decision under review rendered by the Presiding Judge had made a most painstaking scrutiny in weighing the evidence relating to the confession (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Raymundo, 14 Phil. 416) the probative value of such evidence having been addressed in the first instance to said Presiding Judge whose discretion must be controlled by all the attendant circumstances (U.S. <em>vs</em>. De Leon, 27 Phil. 506). And since the Presiding Judge is duty-bound to take into consideration circumstances and conditions under which the confession was obtained in passing upon its weight and admissibility (People <em>vs</em>. Francisco, 74 SCRA 158), the fact as noted in the decision that "accused is not a hardened criminal for which the police will be hard against him, but a security guard of the Feati University, a station in life which will deter the police to commit any brutality," and We may add a profession that exemplifies more than average intelligence, strong courage, discipline and rigorous training, belies the claim of the accused that his confession was obtained through force, duress and intimidation.</p> <p>Accused-appellant has not also pointed to any evil or bad motive that prompted the police officers to testify against him and since these prosecution witnesses have no reason to impute falsely on the defendant the commission of so grave an offense, they deserve credence and belief. (People <em>vs</em>. Borbano, 76 Phil. 702; People <em>vs</em>. Albapara, 22 SCRA 1043).</p> <p>Finally but briefly, on the defense of alibi and his claim that he should have been acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt, We hold and affirm the lower court's ruling that the alibi of the accused is a weak defense, not only because of the facility with which it was fabricated but also because it is so easy for witnesses to get confused as to the dates and becomes worthless in the face of positive identification by prosecution witnesses pointing to the accused as particeps criminis. For alibi to prosper, the rule is that it is not enough to prove that the defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed but he must likewise demonstrate that it is physically impossible for him to be in the scene of the crime at, the time. In the case at bar, the accused was positively identified by Jose Yambao, an eyewitness whom the court accorded unimpeachable credibility and the court further took judicial notice that it will not take more than one hour from Josefina Street, Sampaloc, Manila where the accused was supposed to be, to reach the scene of the crime. More than that, the finding of the court that the testimony of the accused alleging that he stayed with Nilda Caracas in Josefina Street for two hours just to get his College Physics from her, is unnatural and improbable since he, being a security guard, will be under strict order to stay in the premises of the university and on alert due to the impending student demonstration going to the premises of the school, is well justified, to which We give Our affirmance.</p> <p>In fine, the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence on record has produced the required moral certainty as to the guilt of the accused, in an unprejudiced mind. (Sec. 2, Rule 133, Revised Rules of Court). The finding of the court that the crime committed is murder with multiple attempted murder qualified by the use of explosive, is correct, as well as the presence of the aggravating circumstance of treachery without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same.</p> <p>The imposition of the death penalty by the trial court is likewise in accordance with law but in the absence of the required votes to affirm the death sentence, the same is hereby reduced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. The payment of damages to the heirs of the victim and to the offended parties shall remain.</p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the decision under review is hereby MODIFIED in that the accused, Arcadio de la Rosa y Landicho, is hereby sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Francis Sontillano the sum of Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00) for the death of the latter, and the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) by way of moral damages, also the sum of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) each to victims Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad, and Eleuterio Gutierrez by way of moral damages and to pay the costs.</p> <p>Judgment modified.</p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p><em>Concepcion Jr., Abad Santos, De Castro, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Escolin, Vasquez, Relova</em> and <em>Gutierrez, Jr., JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Fernando, C.J.,</em> on official leave.<br><em>Teehankee, (Acting C.J.),</em> and <em>Aquino, J.,</em> took no part.<br><em>Makasiar, J.,</em> see dissenting.<br><br><br> <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="center"> <div align="center"><br><br><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></div> <p><strong>MAKASIAR, J.:</strong></p> <p>In his signed confession, the accused-appellant admitted throwing the pillbox only to scare the student demonstrators. Unfortunately, he miscalculated his aim and distance, as it fell on the head of and killed the victim as well as caused physical injuries to; three other student demonstrators. It appears therefore that there was no intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed, which should be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance.</p> <p>Was the crime committed murder or simply homicide?</p> <p>The majority opinion considers the use of explosive as the circumstance to qualify the crime as murder. This is not sustained by paragraph 3 of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. To qualify the crime as murder, the explosion must involve "great waste and ruin." Here, the pillbox was only about the size of a "balut" egg and the explosion did not cause great waste and ruin. It caused the death of only one man, and serious physical injuries to three students who were in the vicinity of the explosion, among several hundred demonstrators. If it were a bomb, a grenade, or dynamite sticks, the victims would be numerous. It did not damage any structure in the vicinity. Consequently, the same should not be appreciated as qualifying circumstance (See People <em>vs</em>. Laigo, 99 Phil. 1061; People <em>vs</em>. Francisco, 94 Phil. 975; People <em>vs</em>. Gallego, et al., 82 Phil. 335; People <em>vs</em>. Agcaoili, 86 Phil. 549; People <em>vs</em>. Guillen, 85 Phil. 307).</p> <p>Considering all circumstances favorable to him, it could even be said that the accused is guilty of homicide thru reckless imprudence for he was not able to throw the pillbox way beyond the demonstrators. But he did not aim the pillbox at any particular student. He merely intended to scare the students who were stoning the classrooms and breaking the window glasses of the Feati building and shouting invectives and also hurling stones at the security guards. And because the students inside the classrooms did not want to leave the classrooms, the demonstrators stoned and fired at them. One of his companions was hit. Thus, he stated in his confession:</p> <blockquote> <p>". . At dahil ayaw lumabas ang mga estudyante sa loob ng mga kuwarto <em>ay pinagbabato nila at pinaputukan ng baril. Nang makita kong may natamaan ng bato sa mga kasama ko at nagkakasirasira ang mga bintana ng Feati University ay naghagis ako ng pill-box para takutin ang mga estudyanteng nambabato para umalis sila sa paligid</em>. Hindi ko alam na mayroon palang natamaan sa aking paghagis.</p> <p>"T — Saan ka ba naroroon ng maghagis ka ng pill-box?</p> <p>"S — Nasa 2nd floor ng New main building sa may dulo nakaharap sa Helios St.."</p></blockquote> <p>The appellant continued to state that when he was informed by his companion security guard that someone was hit by the pillbox, he went to call a policeman at Echague St. After he called the policeman, the other student demonstrators loaded the person hit by the pillbox in a taxi. After he informed the chief security officer, Jorge Mendoza, of Feati University about the incident and that one student was hit by the pillbox, Mendoza instructed them to tighten their guarding because the student demonstrators might invade the Feati compound.</p> <p>By their taunting and insulting remarks at the students and at the security guards and by hurling stones as well as firing their guns at the students inside the classrooms and at the security guards, the student demonstrators provoked the appellant security guard to react in the manner he did but only to frighten them without intending to harm them, much less kill them.</p> <p>Throwing stones and firing their guns at the students who refused to go out of their classrooms and at the security guards by the student demonstrators, endangered the lives of the students inside the classrooms and the security guards. The act of the appellant in lobbing a pillbox to scare the demonstrators is similar to defense of strangers.</p> <p>It is not disputed that the demonstration in December, 1970 and the demonstrations preceding it and subsequent to it were attended by violence or were held in a background of violence typified by the mendiola bloody incident.</p> <p>While demonstration is protected by the constitutional guarantee of free expression and peaceful assembly, the exercise or enjoyment of which is accorded utmost generosity or liberality, such constitutional rights are not without limitation. When the demonstration is set against the background of violence or staged in the context of violence, it divests itself of constitutional protection; because the employment of violence is illegal (see Milk Wagon Drivers Union <em>v</em>. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., 312 US 287, 293). In the words of Chief Justice Fernando: "There is no excuse for violence, injury to property, acts of vandalism. To give vent to one's destructive urge is to call for condemnation. It is to make a mockery of the high estate occupied by intellectual liberty in our constitutional scheme" (E.M. Fernando, The Bill of Rights, 1977 Ed., p. 621). When a demonstration is accompanied or characterized by violence, it ceases to be peaceful and becomes an illegal assembly which forfeits its right to invoke the protection of the Constitution.</p> <p>As Mr. Justice Frankfurter so eloquently stated in the Milk Wagon Drivers Union case, <em>supra</em>: "It must never be forgotten, however, that the Bill of Rights was the child of the Enlightenment. Back of the guaranty of free speech lay faith in the power of an appeal to reason by all the peaceful means for gaining access to the mind. It was in order to avert force and explosion due to restrictions upon rational modes of communications that the guaranty of free speech was given a generous scope. But utterance in a context of violence can lose its significance as an appeal to reason and become part of an instrument of force. Such utterance was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution."</p> <p>The appellant herein had the duty as security guard of the school to protect the lives of the students and properties of the institution which employed him.</p> <p>The violent provocation initiated by the student demonstrators should therefore justify in characterizing the crime committed by appellant as simple homicide and not murder.</p></div>
