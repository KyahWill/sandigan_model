<p class="BODY">This is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> of the

Appeals promulgated on September 29, 1969 in CA-G.R. No. 35036-R (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 11) setting aside the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, Branch 1, dated September 24, 1964 which 
dismissed the complaint <span>for </span>recovery of possession in Civil Case 
No. 181-S and declared the cemetery site on Lot No. 76 in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> as property <span>of </span>the municipality of 
<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> (Record on Appeal, p. 9).</p>
<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the 
questioned decision reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Lot No. 76 containing an area of 208,157 sq. meters forms a part 
of Cadastral Lot No. 140 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 11), a 
27.2460 ha. <span class="GramE">sugar</span> land located in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Madanlog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, in the name of the deceased Gonzalo

Occidental, for the year 1941 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "3", Folder of

Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span>, who was then only six months old 
(TSN, July 1, 1964, p. 34).</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span>, married to 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soliva</span>, inherited the whole of Lot No. 140 
from her grandmother, <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> J. <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de</em> Ditching (<em>not</em> from her 
predeceased mother Isabel Ditching).<span>&nbsp; </span>In 1952, she donated a 
portion of Lot No. 140, about 3 <span class="GramE">ha.,</span> to the 
municipality for the ground of a certain high school, and had 4 ha. <span class="GramE">converted</span> into a subdivision (TSN, July 1, 1964, p. 24).</p>
<p class="BODY">In 1963, she had the remaining 21 ha. <span class="GramE">or</span> 
208, 157 sq. m. relocated by a surveyor upon request of lessee Ramon <span class="SpellE">Jover</span> who complained of being prohibited by municipal 
officials from cultivating the land.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was then that she 
discovered that the parcel of land, more or less 4 ha. <span class="GramE">or</span> 33,747 sq. m. used by Petitioner Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>, as a cemetery from 1934, is within her property 
which is now identified as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 76 and covered by TCT No. 
34546 (TSN, <st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1964">July 1, 1964</st1:date>, pp.

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="20" year="1963">May 20,

rentals and requesting delivery of the area allegedly illegally occupied by 
Petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G", Folder of Exhibits, p. 
15).<span>&nbsp; </span>When the Mayor replied that Petitioner bought the land she 
asked to be shown the papers concerning the sale but was referred by the Mayor 
to the municipal treasurer who refused to show the same (TSN, July 1, 1964, pp. 
32-33).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="11" year="1964">January 11,

<p class="BODY"><span>On motion of counsel for the Respondents (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 104), the Court resolved on June 30, 1972

appeal in behalf of the estate of respondent Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span> who died on January 25, 1972, Respondent 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soliva</span> having been appointed special

Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 110).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In their brief, petitioner raised the following errors of 
respondent Court of Appeals:<span>&nbsp; </span>(Brief for the Petitioner, p. 
</span>1<span>-</span>3);</p>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondents 
Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soliva</span> are the lawful owners of the land in litigation as 
they are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the possession and 
ownership of herein petitioner which dates back to more than 30 
years.</blockquote>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals also erred in ordering the petitioner 
to deliver the possession of the land in question to the respondents Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soliva</span>, 
by holding that non-annotation on the Torrens Certificate of Title could not 
affect the said land when the possession by the petitioner of the said land for 
over 30 years and using it as a public cemetery for that length of time are 
sufficient proof of purchase and transfer of title and non-annotation of the 
Certificate of Title did not render the sale ineffectual.</blockquote>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals further erred in ordering the 
petitioner Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> to pay the 
respondents the sum of P400.00 a year from 1963 until possession is actually 
delivered because under the law, an owner of a piece of land has no obligation 
to pay rentals as it owns and <span class="GramE">possesses</span> the 
same.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>There is merit in the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is undisputed that petitioner failed to present before 
the Court a Deed of Sale to prove its purchase of the land in question which is 
included in the Transfer Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">T-34546 in 
the name of private respondent Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The pivotal issue in this case is whether or not the 
secondary evidence presented by the petitioner municipality is sufficient to 
substantiate its claim that it acquired the disputed land by means of a Deed of 
Sale.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Under the Best Evidence Rule when the original writing is 
lost or otherwise unavailable, the law in point provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 4.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><em>Secondary 
evidence when original is lost or destroyed</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>— When the 
original writing has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, 
upon proof of its execution and loss or destruction or unavailability, its 
contents may be proved by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some 
authentic document, or by the recollection of witnesses." (Rule 130, Rules of 
Court).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals was of the view (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 16) that a mere entry in the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> register of a notary public of an alleged sale 
cannot prove that a particular piece of land was sold by one person to another, 
one of the important requirements being the indication of the area and the 
technical description of the land being sold.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the present case, 
since no deed of sale could be produced, there is no way of telling what 
particular portion of the property was sold to defendant municipality and how 
big was the sale of the land conveyed to the defendant municipality.</p>
<p class="BODY">It will be observed that the entries in the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> register clearly show:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) the nature 
of the instrument. — a deed of sale; (b) the subject of the sale - two parcels 
of land, Lot Nos. 140-A and 140-B; (c) the parties of the contract — the vendor 
<span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> J.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Vda.

and (f) the date of the sale on July 9, 1934.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is beyond question that the foregoing certificate is an 
authentic document clearly corroborated and supported by:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) the 
testimony of the municipal councilor of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>, 
Ricardo Suarez, (Original TSN Hearing of September 14, 1964, pp. 12-22) who 
negotiated the sale; (b) the testimony of Emilio <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, (Original TSN Hearing of September <span>14, 1964, 
</span>pp. 22-38) the municipal treasurer of said municipality, since 1932 up to 
the date of trial on September 14, 1964, who personally paid the amount of 
P750.00 to Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span> as consideration of the 
Contract of Sale; (c) Certificate of Settlement (Original Exhibits, p. 20) "as 
evidence of said payment"; (d) Tax Declaration No. 429 (Ibid., p. 22) which was

follows:</p>

as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"Note:<span>&nbsp; </span>The whole Lot No. <span class="GramE">140,</span>

Municipality and ratified by Notary Public Mr. Vicente Aragon under Doc. No. 
132; Page No. 2; Book No. 10, Series of 1934."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">At the lowest portion under <em>Memoranda</em> it was explained 
that —</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="2Q">"The area under this declaration includes 
3,746 sq. meters donated by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> <span class="SpellE">Jingco</span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de</em> 
Ditching and used as road leading to the cemetery." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4; Original Exhibits, p. 23).</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The above-mentioned testimonies and documentary evidence 
sufficiently identify the land sold by the predecessors-in-interest of private 
respondent.<span>&nbsp; </span>To insist on the technical description of the land in 
dispute would be to sacrifice substance to form which would undoubtedly result 
in manifest injustice to the petitioner.</p>
<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is expressly provided by law that the thing sold 
shall be understood as delivered, when it is placed in the control and 
possession of the vendee.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Civil Code Art. 
1497).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Where there is no express provision that title shall 
not pass until payment of the price, and the thing sold has been delivered, 
title passes from the moment the thing sold is placed in the possession and 
control of the buyer.<span> </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Kuenzle</em></span> <em>&amp; Streiff vs. Watson &amp; 
Co.</em>, 13 Phil. 26 [1909]).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Delivery produces its 
natural effects in law, the principal and most <span>important of which being 
the conveyance of ownership, without prejudice to the right of the vendor to 
claim payment of the price.<span> </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Ocejo</em></span><em>, Perez &amp; Co. v. International Banking 
Corp.</em>, 37 Phil. 631 [1918]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Similarly, when the sale is made through a public instrument, the 
execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the 
object of the contract, if from the <span class="GramE">deed,</span> the contrary 
does not appear or cannot be clearly inferred. <span class="GramE">(Civil Code 
Art. 1498).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The execution of the public instrument operates 
as a formal or symbolic delivery of the property sold and authorizes the buyer 
to use the document as proof of ownership.<span> </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Florendo</em></span><em> v. Foz,</em> 20 Phil. 388 
[1911]).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar it is undisputed that petitioner had been in 
open, public, adverse and continuous possession of the land for a period of 
<span>more </span>than thirty years.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, according to the 
municipal treasurer there are over 1000 graves in the cemetery.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(Decision, Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 11-22).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">As correctly observed by Justice <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> 
S. <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> in his dissenting opinion (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 23-28) in the decision of this case by 
the Court of Appeals, the evidence establishes without debate that the property 
was originally registered in 1916.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff was born only in 1928 
and cannot possibly be the registered owner of the original lot 140 at the 
time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, according to her own evidence, (Exhibit A; 
<span>Original Record pp. 1-3) she became the registered owner only in 
1963.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>Likewise, it is undisputed that in the intestate 
estate of Gonzalo Ditching, the grandfather of private respondent Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span>, it was her grandmother, <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span>, the surviving spouse of Gonzalo who was named 
judicial <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to 
Norma's own testimony, Isabel, her mother, died in 1928 (TSN Aug. 12, 1964, p. 
<span>34) </span>while <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> the grandmother died in 
1942. <span class="GramE">(Ibid.)</span> Therefore, as of 1934 when a document of 
sale was executed by <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> in favor of the 
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> as indubitably shown in the 
<span class="SpellE">notarial</span> register (Exhibit 5-A) in question, <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> was still the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the properties left by her husband, 
Gonzalo and of their conjugal partnership.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, she is 
the only person who could legally dispose of by sale this particular 
four-hectare portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 140.<span>&nbsp; </span>And so it 
is, that in <span>1934, </span><span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> Ditching in her 
capacity as judicial <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> made and executed 
the document described <span>in </span>the <span class="SpellE">Notarial</span> 
Report as Lots 140-A and 140-B, showing clearly that they are portions of the 
original big Lot 140.<span>&nbsp; </span>As this conveyance was executed by the 
judicial <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, unquestionably the party 
authorized to dispose of the same, the presumption must be that she did so upon 
proper authority of the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p class="BODY">As to the description of the property sold, the fact that a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> report shows that they are portions of Lot 140 and 
the property in question occupied by the public cemetery is admittedly a portion 
of said lot in the absence of evidence that there were other portions of Lot 140 
ceded unto the petitioner municipality, the inevitable conclusion is that the 
sale executed in the <span class="SpellE">Notarial</span> Register refers to the 
disputed lot.</p>
<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, the purchaser 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Victorias</span></st1:placename></st1:place> failed to register 
said Deed of Sale; hence, when <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> <span class="SpellE">Jingco</span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de</em> 
Ditching died, her granddaughter, respondent Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span> claimed to have inherited the land in dispute 
and succeeded in registering said land under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> 
system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said land is now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title 
No. T-34036 (Exhibit A, <em>supra</em>) issued by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental on March 11, 1963 in the name of Norma 
<span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span>, married to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soliva</span>, containing an area of 208,157 square meters.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>As registered owner, she is unquestionably entitled to the protection 
afforded to a holder of a Torrens Title.</p>
<p class="BODY">Admittedly, it is well-settled that under the Torrens System, 
"Every person receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a decree of <span class="GramE">registration, ...</span> shall hold the same free of all encumbrance 
except those noted on said certificate x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Sec. 39, Act 496, now Sec. 43, PD 1529).</p>
<p class="BODY">In the instant case, however, respondent Norma <span class="SpellE">Leuenberger</span> admitted that she inherited the land covered by 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-34036 from her grandmother, who had already 
sold the land to the petitioner in 1934; hence, she merely stepped into the 
shoes of <span>her </span>grandmother and she cannot claim a better right than 
her predecessor-in-interest.<span>&nbsp; </span>When she applied for registration of 
the disputed land, she had no legal right to do so as she had no ownership of 
the land since land registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership but only 
of confirming ownership of the land.<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">(<em>Grande, 
et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.</em>, 115 Phil. 521.)</span> "The Torrens 
System was not established as a means for the acquisition of title to private 
land, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" It is intended 
merely to confirm and register the title which one may already <span>have 
</span>on the land.<span>&nbsp; </span>Where the applicant possesses no title or 
ownership over the parcel of land, he cannot acquire one under the 
<st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system of Registration.<span> </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Torela</em></span><em>, et al., vs. Torela, 
et al.</em>, L-27843, October 11, 1979).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">While an inherently defective Torrens title may not ordinarily be 
cancelled even after proof of its defect, the law <em>nevertheless 
safeguards</em> the rightful party's interest in the titled land from fraud and 
improper use of technicalities by allowing such party, in appropriate cases, to 
judicially seek <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to him of whatever he has 
been deprived of as long as the land has not been transferred or conveyed to a 
purchaser in good faith. <span class="GramE">(<em>Pedro Pascua, et al., vs. 
Mariano Gopuyoc, et al.</em>, L-23197, May 31, 1977.)</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The Civil Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>"Art. 1456<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>If</span> the property 
is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is, by force of 
law, considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from 
whom the property comes."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Thus, it has been held that where the land is decreed in the name 
of a person through fraud or mistake, such person is by operation of law 
considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the persons from 
whom the property comes.<span>&nbsp; </span>The beneficiary shall have the right to 
enforce the trust, notwithstanding the irrevocability of the 
<st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title and the trustee and his 
successors-in-interest are bound to execute the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">(<em>Pacheco 
vs. Arro</em>, 85 Phil. 505; <em>Escobar vs. Locsin</em>, 74 Phil. 
86).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">As the land in dispute is held by private respondents in trust for 
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Victorias</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, 
it is logical to conclude that the latter can neither be deprived of its 
possession nor be made to pay rentals thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>Private respondent 
is in equity bound to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the subject land to the 
<span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">que</span> 
trust</u>, the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Victorias</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
<st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system was never calculated to foment betrayal in 
the performance of a trust.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Escobar vs. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, 74 Phil. 86).</p>
<p class="BODY">For a more expeditious disposition of the case at bar, Rule 39 of 
the Rules of Court provides:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 10.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Judgment for Specific acts; vesting title.</span> — x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If real or personal property 
is within the Philippines, the court in lieu of directing a conveyance thereof 
may enter judgment divesting the title of any party and vesting it in others and 
such judgment shall have the force and effect of a conveyance executed in due 
form of law."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Finally, the conclusions and findings of fact by the trial court 
are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless for 
strong and cogent reasons because the trial court is in a better position to 
examine real evidence, as well as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while 
testifying in the case.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Chase v. Buencamino
