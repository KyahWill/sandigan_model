Santos appeals the decision of the Regional Trial Court of the National Capital
Region, Branch 152 of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila in Criminal
Case No. 714-D, convicting him of violation of Section 4, Art. II, of Republic
Act No. 6425, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1675, known as the
Dangerous Drugs Act, and sentencing him to life imprisonment, plus a fine of
Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, and to pay the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution shows that having been informed
of rampant drug trafficking activities among the youth at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Malvar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Streets in <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>, Metro Manila, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span>, PFC Harrison <span class="SpellE">Amanon</span>,
and Sgt. Jimmy Navarro, all of the Anti-Narcotics Unit of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>,
organized a buy-bust operation which was implemented on <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1988</st1:date> at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30</st1:time> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span> acted as a poseur-buyer
with a marked twenty-peso bill with Serial No. DR-185346 and with his initials
on it.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The team proceeded to the named streets and there Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span> saw the suspect, the accused-appellant, wearing a
"HANG TEN" flesh-colored T-shirt, as earlier described by their
"asset" (informer).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
approached <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span>, told him, "<span class="SpellE">iiskor</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>," meaning,
"I'd like to buy marijuana,"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and gave him the marked twenty peso bill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After two minutes, <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> returned and
handed Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span> six (6) sticks of
cigarettes wrapped in a transparent plastic bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span>
arrested <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span>, who instantly dropped the paper
bill and stepped on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The officer held
<span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> by the arm; at the same time, identifying
himself as an agent of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Josefino</span>, trying to repulse the arrest,
broke loose from Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso's</span> grip, and ran
into the crowded alley or "<span class="SpellE">iskinita</span>." But
he was collared by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso's</span> companion.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
He was then taken to the Eastern Police District Headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The six confiscated cigarette sticks were
turned over to Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span> Crime Laboratory Service
for examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tests positively
identified the subjects under examination as marijuana as shown by Chemistry
Report No. D-680-88, Exhibit "A".<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> vehemently denied Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso's</span> accusation that he was selling a prohibited
drug, and claimed he was a victim of "mistaken identity."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was <span class="SpellE">Josefino's</span> first arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time he was on his third year of
employment as a shoemaker in a factory at the back of his house at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Malvar</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:city></st1:address>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
His job was to apply paste on the heels of shoes and he was paid on a per-piece
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1988</st1:date>, he reported to work at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00</st1:time> in the morning and left the factory four and a half
hours later, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time>, to have lunch
at home.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While he was cooking lunch, he was startled by a commotion
outside his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he went out to
check what was going on, a stranger suddenly seized him by the arm and arrested
him without a warrant of arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
He did not have the slightest idea about what was going on had not his
employer, Dante Aguirre, intervened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the arresting officer, Dante learned that <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span>
was being arrested for selling marijuana cigarettes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant challenges the inconsistencies of the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses which render them unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also faults the trial court for its
failure to appreciate certain material facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in his Brief he assigned only one error committed by the trial
court, i.e.,</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT
HOLDING THAT THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION HAS FAILED TO MEET THE TEST OF
MORAL CERTAINTY OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT'S GUILT AND TO OVERCOME THE CONSTITUTIONAL
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IN HIS FAVOR.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised in the appellant's Brief hinges on the
credibility of witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point,
we have consistently deferred to the findings of the trial judge, who observes
first hand the demeanor and deportment of the witnesses so as to determine the
believability of their testimonies.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
As an appellate court, this Court has none of the judge's advantageous
position, relying as it does only on the cold records of the case, and on the
judge's discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court established the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1988</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30
 a.m.</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> was caught red-handed
peddling or "pushing" six sticks of marijuana cigarettes to an
undercover NARCOM agent, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span>, in a
buy-bust operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The discrepancies in the testimonies of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span> are minor inconsistencies that do not invalidate <span class="SpellE">Josefino's</span> conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As long as the testimonies <span style="">jibe </span>on
material points, the slight clashing statements neither dilute the witnesses'
credibility nor the veracity of their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span>,
like any other witness on the stand, was confused by the questions raised by
the fiscal and the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one
instance, he declared that he did not actually see the person he arrested selling
marijuana.</p>
