February 12, 1987, reinstating its decision promulgated on May 9, 1986 in
AC-G.R. CV No. 04242 wherein it affirmed the decision of the trial court
holding that the services rendered by private respondent was on a professional,
and not on a <u>gratis</u> <u>et</u> <u>amore</u>, basis and ordering
petitioner to pay private respondent the sum of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as the balance of the latter's legal fee <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>sometime
in January, 1981, petitioner and his father went to the residence of private
respondent, accompanied by the latter's cousin, to seek <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">his </span>advice regarding the problem of the alleged indebtedness of
petitioner's brother, Dewey Dee, to Caesar's Palace, a well?known
gambling casino at Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A. Petitioner's father was
apprehensive over the safety of his son, Dewey, having heard of a link between
the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">mafia</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> and </span>Caesar's Palace and the
possibility that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his </span>son may be
harmed at the instance of the latter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent assured petitioner and his father that he
would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">inquire </span>into the matter,
after which his services were reportedly contracted for P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From his residence, private respondent called
up Caesar's Palace and, thereafter, several long distance telephone calls and
two trips to <st1:city><st1:place>Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:city> by him
elicited the information that Dewey Dee's outstanding account was around
$1,000,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further investigations,
however, revealed that said account had actually been incurred by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, with Dewey Dee merely signing for the chits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent communicated said
information to petitioner's father and also assured him that Caesar's Palace
was not in any way linked to the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">mafia</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In June, 1981, private respondent personally talked with the
president of Caesar's Palace at <st1:place><st1:city>Las Vegas</st1:city>, <st1:state>Nevada</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He advised the president that for the sake and
in the interest of the casino it would be better to make Ramon <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> answer for the indebtedness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The president told him that if he could
convince Ramon <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> to acknowledge the obligation,
Dewey Dee would be exculpated from liability for the account.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon private respondent's return to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
he conferred with Ramon <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and the latter was
convinced to acknowledge the indebtedness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In August, 1981, private respondent brought to Caesar's Palace the
letter of Ramon <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">S</span>y</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>owning the debt and asking for a
discount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the account of
Dewey Dee was cleared and the casino never bothered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Having thus settled the account of petitioner's brother, private
respondent sent several demand letters to petitioner demanding the balance of
P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, however, ignored said
letters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1982</st1:date>, private respondent filed a complaint
against petitioner in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
Branch CXXXVI, for the collection of attorney's fees and refund of transport
fare and other expenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent claimed that petitioner formally engaged his
services for a fee of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and that the
services he rendered were professional services which a lawyer renders to a
client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, however, denied the
existence of any professional relationship of attorney and client between him
and private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admits that
he and his father visited private respondent for advice on the matter of Dewey
Dee's gambling account.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he
insists that such visit was merely an informal one and that private respondent
had not been specifically contracted to handle the problem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, respondent <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> had allegedly volunteered his services "as a
friend of defendant's family" to see what he could do about the situation.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>As for the P50,000.00 inceptively given
to private respondent, petitioner claims that it was not in the nature of
attorney's fees but merely "pocket money" solicited by the former for
his trips to Las Vegas and the said amount of P50,000.00 was already sufficient
remuneration for his strictly voluntary services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in due time, filed a motion for reconsideration
contending that the Appellate Court overlooked two important and decisive
factors, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) At the time private
respondent was ostensibly rendering services to petitioner and his father, he
was actually working "in the interest" and "to the
advantage" of Caesar's Palace of which he was an agent and a consultant,
hence the interests of the casino and private respondent were united in their
objective to collect from the debtor; and (2) Private respondent is not justified
in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">claiming that </span>he rendered
legal services to petitioner and his father in view of the conflicting
interests involved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In its resolution of July
31, 1986, respondent court reconsidered its decision and held that the sum of </span>P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">already paid
by petitioner to private respondent was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

but were nevertheless auspiciously discussed therein, at the risk of seeming
prolixity we quote hereunder the salient portions of the assailed resolution
which demonstrate that it was not conceived in error.</p>

<blockquote>"The reason for then <span class="SpellE">IAC's</span> action is
that it deemed the P50,000.00 plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had
previously received from defendant-appellant as adequate compensation for the
services rendered by him for defendant-appellant, considering that at the time
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was acting as counsel for
defendant-appellant, he was also acting as the collecting agent and consultant
of, and receiving compensation from Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada, the
entity with whom defendant-appellant was having a problem and for which he had
engaged the services of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crux of the matter, therefore, is whether
or not the evidence on record justifies this finding of the IAC.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> maintains that
his professional services to defendant-appellant were rendered between the months
of July and September of 1981, while his employment as collection agent and
consultant of Caesar's Palace covered the period from December 1981 to October
1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This positive testimony of
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, however, was disregarded by the
IAC for the following reasons:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In</span>
August 1983, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> testified that he was
a representative of Caesar's Palace in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
‘about two or three years ago.’ From this the IAC concluded that the period
covers the time plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> rendered
professional services to defendant-appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We do not think that <span class="SpellE">IAC's</span>
conclusion is necessarily correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> gave the period ‘about two or
three years ago,’ he was merely stating an approximation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was testifying in August 1983, and his employment
with Caesar's Palace began in December 1981, the stated difference of two years
is relatively <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span>
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had testified that he was working
‘for the sake,’ ‘in the interest,’ and ‘to the advantage’ of Caesar's Palace. x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We detect nothing from the above which would support <span class="SpellE">IAC's</span> conclusion that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was then in the employ of Caesar's Palace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What is gathered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>that
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was simply fulfilling a condition
which plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had proposed to, and was
accepted by, Caesar's Palace, for the release of Dewey Dee from his obligation
to Caesar's Palace.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Caesar's</span>
Palace would not have listened to, and acted upon, the advice of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> if he were no longer its consultant and alter ego.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Why not?</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are witnesses to many successful
negotiations between contending parties whose representing lawyers were not and
were never in the employ of the opposite party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The art of negotiation is precisely one of the essential tools of a good
practitioner, and mastery of the art takes into account the circumstance that
one may be negotiating, among others, with a person who may not only be a
complete stranger but antagonistic as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was able to
secure a favorable concession from Caesar's Palace for defendant-appellant does
not justify the conclusion that it could have been secured only because of
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> professional relationship with
Caesar's Palace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could have been
attributable more to plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> stature as
a former ambassador of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
his personality, and his negotiating technique.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming, however, that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was employed by Caesar's Palace during the time that he was rendering
professional services for defendant-appellant, this would not automatically
mean the denial of additional attorney's fees to plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The main reason why the IAC denied plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> additional compensation was because the latter was
allegedly receiving compensation from Caesar's Palace, and, therefore, the
amount of P50,000.00 plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had
previously received from defendant-appellant is ‘reasonable and commensurate.’
This conclusion, however, can only be justified if the fact and amount of
remuneration had been established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
were not proven at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No proof was
presented as to the nature of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
remuneration, and the mode or manner in which it was paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

petitioner's assumption that the interests of Caesar's Palace were adverse to
those of Dewey Dee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True, the casino was
a creditor but that fact was not contested or opposed by Dewey Dee, since the
latter, as verifications revealed, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>not
the debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, private respondent's
representations in behalf of petitioner were not in resistance to the casino's
claim but were actually geared toward proving that fact by establishing the
liability of the true debtor, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, from whom
payment was ultimately and correctly exacted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span>positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, at a certain
