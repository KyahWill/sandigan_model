				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The subject of this dispute is a strip of land between two lots
owned by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has an area
of 613 square meters and is situated in <span class="SpellE">Calabuso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>, Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was discovered only in 1983 after a survey conducted by the Bureau of Lands and
is now identified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>Lot No.
5005 of the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> Estate.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Registration thereof in the name of the petitioner was decreed in 1984 by the
trial court pursuant to the Property Registration Law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
On appeal, the order was reversed by a special division of the respondent
court, with two members dissenting.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioner is now before us, claiming that the reversal was erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two lots bordering the subject property are Lot No. 2381,
containing an area of 36.672 square meters, and Lot No. 2386-A, containing an
area of 32,011 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both are
now registered in the name of the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The history of these lots is described by the trial court as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The record shows that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2381 was purchased
on installment basis by <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimaranan</span>,
and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2386 was acquired under similar condition by
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, both from the Friar Lands Division of
the Bureau of Lands (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span> "S" and
"R") in the year 1910.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eight
(8) years thereafter, installment-payment for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2386
was completed in favor of <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimaranan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2381 was on <st1:date year="1911" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1911</st1:date>
assigned to <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">who </span>continued and completed the
installment payments culminating into the issuance in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">his </span>name of Patent No. 19138 on <st1:date year="1919" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1919</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>,
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2381 was acquired by Fidel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">M. </span>Cabrera, Sr. and the title was transferred to his name (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "F") while <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2386
was acquired by the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"J-2").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On August 27, 1981,
Lot 2386-A was sold by the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> to the applicant
South City Homes, Inc. (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "J").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2381 was on <st1:date year="1977" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1977</st1:date> sold by Fidel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">M. </span>Cabrera, Sr. to <span class="SpellE">Koo</span>
Jun Eng (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G") <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

1981 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "H").<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">It is the position of the petitioner that Lot No. 5005 should be
registered in its name for either of two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first is that the disputed strip of land
really formed, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">part </span>of Lots 2381
and 2386-A but was omitted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> only because of
the inaccuracies of the old system of cadastral surveys.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second is that it had acquired the
property by prescription through uninterrupted possession thereof <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>concept of owner, by itself and its
predecessors-in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">-</span>interest, for
more than forty years.</p>

<p class="BODY">For <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">its </span>part, the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
argues that the elongated piece of land between the two lots now owned by the
petitioner used to be a canal which could not have been appropriated by the
purchasers of the adjacent lots <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or
their </span>successors-in-interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither could it be deemed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">included
</span>in the lots now owned by the petitioner because their respective
technical descriptions indicate otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Prescription is also not applicable because the petitioner has not
established the requisite possession of the lot, as to manner and length, to
justify judicial confirmation of title <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in
</span>its name.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties also differ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on
</span>the nature of the disputed lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner insists it is patrimonial property of the State, being
part of the so-called Friar Lands, while the Republic maintains it is part of
the public domain and cannot therefore be acquired by a private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>But this disagreement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>irrelevant,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>will appear later.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has considered the issues and the arguments of the
parties and finds that the petition has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">To argue that Lot No. 5005 is really a part of the other two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lots </span>owned by the petitioner is to
oppose the obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is obvious is
the technical descriptions of the two lots whose areas do not include the strip
of land between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petitioner </span>points to the original
survey of the lands in 1906 which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">states
</span>that the two lots adjoin each other, without mention of what is now Lot
No. 5005.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it, forgets that it has
itself suggested that the old surveys were inaccurate, which could explain the
omission.</p>

<p class="BODY">If it is true that there was no canal between the two lots <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">at </span>the time of their survey, then the
disputed strip of land should have been included as part of either of the two
adjoining <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It was not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner itself insists that the canal,
if there ever was one, had disappeared after it had been filled with silt and
dirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The result was the segregation of a
third and separate lot, now known as Lot No. 5005.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notably, the area of that dried-up canal is
not negligible as to come under what the petitioner calls the allowable margin
of error in the original survey.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic submits that the petitioner and its
predecessors-in-interest could not have appropriated the strip of land because
it used to be a canal over which they could not have acquired any exclusive
right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The applicable law is Act No.
1120, otherwise known as the Friar Lands Act, providing in its Section 19 as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>No<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>purchaser or lessee under
this Act shall acquire any exclusive rights to any canal, ditch, reservoir, or
other irrigation works, or to any water supply upon which such irrigation works
are or may be dependent, but all of such irrigation works and water supplies
shall remain under the exclusive control of the Government of the Philippine
Islands and be administered under the direction of the Chief of the Bureau of
Public Lands for the common benefit of those interest dependent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">upon them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the </span>Government <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">reserves
</span>as a part of the contract of sale in each instance the right to levy an
equitable contribution or tax for the maintenance of such irrigation works, the
assessment of which shall be based upon the amount of benefits received, and
each purchaser under this Act, by accepting the certificate of sale or deed
herein provided to be given, shall be held to assent thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And it is further provided that all lands
leased or conveyed under this Act shall remain subject to the right of such
irrigation canals, ditches, and reservoirs as now exist or as the Government
may hereafter see fit to construct.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the respondent court, the fact that the canal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">had </span>been filled up did not change its
nature as a canal; it was still a canal although it had dried up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not think so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A canal without water is not a canal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The status of a canal is not perpetual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the above provision is not
applicable and cannot defeat the petitioner's claim to the disputed property
either as part of two other lots or as a separate lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we have already rejected the contention that the third lot was
part of the other two lots, the petitioner must fall back on its claim of
acquisitive prescription over it as a separate lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its submission is that its possession of the
lot dates back to "time immemorial," by which tired phrase it is
intended to convey the idea that the start of such possession can no longer be
recollected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it can be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's possession does not in fact go
back to "time immemorial" but only to the recent remembered past.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner presented only two witnesses whose testimony
regarding its supposed possession of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 5005 is
essentially hearsay and inherently inadequate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>, an employee of the
petitioner, declared on the stand:</p>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir, as a matter of fact <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">we were duly informed</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>that since the beginning even from the
time of their predecessors-in-interest, such strip of land was believed to be
forming part of the two parcels of land and since the beginning they have been
cultivating the same and treating the said strip of land as their own,
publicly, notoriously and in the concept of owner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other witness, <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Casunuran</span>, was more explicit but his testimony is largely
hearsay also, let alone the fact that the possession he sought to establish is
likewise insufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him,
he worked as a tenant on the land for the previous owners of the other two lots
afore these were acquired by the petitioner and that the subject property was
regarded as part of their lots by their respective owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus he declared:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, since you testified that you worked
both on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2381 and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2386-A
as tenant thereof, did you as a tenant recall that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">you </span>cultivated these two particular parcels of land in its
entirety?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you know that between these two
parcels of land that you were working then, there is a strip of land included
in the area you were working which is not included in the title to the two
parcels of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, I came to know that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, when I became tenant, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">my </span>predecessor used to tell me</u> that
there is a strip in between the two parcels of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>
which I was working on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They even told
me that the owners of the adjoining Lots 2381 and 2386 were lucky <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">because </span>there was added to their
property a strip of land from which they produced also rice but which is not
included in their title.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>According to them</u>,
it happened this way - that from time immemorial, there was an irrigation canal
constructed on this strip of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
the cadastral survey of the lots in <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>, this canal
gradually disappeared by the filling up of dirt and silt, until such time that
no one could notice anymore a canal on this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">strip</span> of land, such that the same was taken possession of by both
the owners of Lot 2381 and Lot 2386 and had it planted with rice in the same
way that the two parcels of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> were planted at
that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And <u>I was likewise
informed by </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">my </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">predecessor</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> </span>that I have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">also </span>to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">till </span>the strip of land, the same
having been considered as properly owned and forming part and parcel of Lots
2381 and 2386 and owned by the respective owners.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The underscored portions stress the <span class="SpellE">unreliableness</span>
of these declarations, which, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>,
is also suspect as self-serving.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony falls short of establishing the manner and length
of possession required by law to vest prescrip­tive title in the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>Lot No. 5005.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, as the Solicitor General
points out in his Comment, the claim of adverse ownership <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>the strip of land between their
respective lots was not exclusive but <u>shared</u> by the
predecessors-in-interest of the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For another, and more importantly, the length of possession claimed by
the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is </span>not sufficient
to vest prescriptive title in it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Casunuran's</span> allegation that the claim
of the petitioner's predecessors-in-interest to the disputed strip of land was
"in the concept of owner, open, public and adversely against the whole
world" was fed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">to him with a </span>leading
question during the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

2386-A have been in possession of this strip of land containing an area of 613
square meters more or less in the concept of owner, open, public and adversely
against the whole world?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The witness was a farmer and could hardly be expected to
understand the legal significance of the question, to which he could give only
the short and simple answer "Yes." He did not and was not asked to
elaborate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statement was also not
corroborated by other witnesses or supported by documents showing that, indeed,
the former owners of the two lots also asserted claims of ownership over the
land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the only
other evidence of such claim is the tax declaration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">on </span>the said lot, which was made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">only </span>in 1980.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But the more telling consideration, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">as </span>the Court sees it, is this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By the testimony of the two witnesses, the petitioner obviously meant to
tack the possession of the two lots by the previous owners to its own
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no need for this
because the petitioner acquired ownership of Lot No. 2381 by assignment and Lot
No. 2386-A by purchase; and such ownership includes the right of
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner is not
claiming prescriptive rights to these two lots, which had previously been
registered in the name of the transferors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The lot it is claiming by prescription is Lot No. 5005, which it did not
acquire from the owner of the other two lots, or from any previous private
registered owner of the lot, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>there
was none</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither of the owners of Lots <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Nos. </span>2381 or 2386-A, in their respective deeds, transferred Lot
No. 5005 to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioner; </span>as
already explained, Lot No. 5005 was not part of either of the two lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner merely occupied the disputed
strip of land believing it to be included in the two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">lots </span>it had acquired from <span class="SpellE">Koo</span> Jun Eng <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>the Garcia spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, even if it be conceded that the
previous owners of the other two lots possessed the disputed lot, their
possession cannot be tacked to the possession of the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The simple reason is that <u>the possession
of the said lot was not and could not have been transferred to the petitioner
when it acquired Lots Nos. 2381 and 2386-A</u> because these two lots did not
include the third lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1138 of the Civil Code provides that -</p>

<blockquote>(1) The present possessor may complete the period necessary for
prescription by tacking his possession to that of his grantor or
predecessor-in-interest.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, tacking of possession is allowed only when there is a <span class="SpellE">privity</span> of contract or relationship between the previous
and present possessors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence
of such <span class="SpellE">privity</span>, the possession of the new occupant
should be counted only from the time it actually began and cannot be lengthened
by connecting it with the possession of the former possessors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus it has been held:</p>

<blockquote><u>A deed, in itself, creates no <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
as </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to land outside </span>its </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">calls</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Nor is <span class="SpellE">privity</span> created by the bare taking of possession of land
previously occupied by the grantor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is therefore the rule, although sharply limited, that <u>a </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deed does not of itself create <span class="SpellE">privity</span> between the grantor and the grantee as to land not
described in the deed</span></u> but occupied by the grantor in connection

this rule is not harsh, the court using the following language: "If A

<p class="BODY">It should also be noted that, according to Article 1135 of the
Civil Code:</p>

<blockquote>In case the adverse claimant possesses by mistake an area greater,
or less, than that expressed in his title, prescription shall be based on the
possession.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This possession, following the above quoted rulings, should be
limited only to that of the successor-in-interest; and in the case of the
herein petitioner, it should begin from 1981 when it acquired the two adjacent
lots and occupied as well the lot in question thinking it to be part of the
other two.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that when the application for registration of the lot
in the name of the petitioner was filed in 1983, the applicant had been in
possession of the property for less than three years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was far too short of the prescriptive
period required for acquisition of immovable property, which is ten years if
the possession is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>good faith
and thirty years if in bad faith, or if the land is public.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The weakness of the
petitioner's position prevents this Court from affirming the claim to the lot
in question either as part of the two other lots or by virtue of acquisitive
prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And having made this
ruling, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the land is patrimonial in
nature or part of the public domain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

because it is </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">private
