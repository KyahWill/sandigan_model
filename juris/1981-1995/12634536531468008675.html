against the now deceased Maria Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and
defendant <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in the
Court of First Instance of Manila, docketed as Civil Case No. 47265, for the

Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to surrender Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 20799 or any other Transfer Certificate of Title issued in lieu
thereof to the plaintiff so that the latter may effect the segregation of two
(2) hectares of </span>land which the late Maria Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
with the marital consent of defendant <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, sold to the plaintiff on September 30, 1944, as
shown by the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Lino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and Maria Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
in favor of the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A true copy

Certificate of Title No. 8848 of the Registry of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City was subsequently issued solely in the names of the late Maria Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and defendant <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> for that parcel of land originally embraced in Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 20799 of the Registry of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,

the Court of First Instance of Manila was pending, the spouses, defendant <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and the now deceased
Maria Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> surreptitiously, fraudulently,
and without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff, mortgaged to the

<blockquote>8. That on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1962</st1:date>,

Transfer Certificate of Title No. 107110, Book No. 539, Page 110 of the

included plaintiff's <span class="SpellE">unseg­regated</span> two (2) hectares
of land embraced in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 8848 of the Registry of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, which were then the subject of

 1966</st1:date>, or about two and one-half (2-1/2) months from date of
registration of said Deed of Absolute <span class="GramE">Sale,</span> a decision

for the purpose of evading the payment of estate and inheri­tance taxes;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>16. That even if plaintiff fails to prove that the said Deed of
Absolute Sale (Annex "C") is absolutely simulated and/or fictitious,
the same is still void and/or <span class="SpellE">recissible</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>17. That the said Deed of Absolute Sale (Annex "C") is

there be <span class="GramE">any,</span> is grossly inadequate compared to the
real value of all the properties fraudulently transferred to the defendants;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>19. That the alleged Deed of Absolute Sale (Annex "C")
was undertaken in fraud of creditors, and in contemplation of the impeding
death of the late Maria Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>20. That the reasonable value of plaintiff's property fraudulently
included in the alleged Deed of Absolute Sale (Annex "C") is
reasonably estimated to be P80.00 per square meter, more or less;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>21. That in order to place beyond the reach of herein plaintiff the
latter's two (2) hectares of land fraudulently included in the alleged Deed of
Absolute Sale, defendants have increased the original obligation secured by the
real estate mortgage constituted over the property embraced in Transfer Certificate
of Title No. 107110 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

Absolute Sale (Annex "C") of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 937-8-2 of

the said action, plaintiff has anchored his right on a "Deed of Absolute
Sale" (Annex "A") said to have been executed by Maria Villanueva
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> (now deceased), with the conformity of herein
defendant <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, on
September 30, 1944 of a parcel of land (Lot 937 of the subdivision plan
Psd-2118, <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate, GLRO Record No. 6975) and

alleged that on May 23, 1962 he filed an action in the Court of First Instance

entitled:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span>
Luis <span class="SpellE">Que</span>, vs. <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and Maria Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
for the segregation of 1/2 of the land said to be purchased by the plaintiff
from said defendant (as appearing in Annex "A") and to surrender its
title to plaintiff; that in the said case, the said defendants asserted that
the transaction between them and the plaintiff was not sale but a loan, which
has been paid and that the action has already prescribed; that the plaintiff
therein won in the said court of first instance but the decision was appealed
to the Court of Appeals; that the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeals
for failure of the defendants (appellants) to show the data that the appeal was
made on time (Sec. 6, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court; but the defendants filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the Supreme Court to review the said
dismissal; and that the said petition has been given due course and is now
pending before the Honorable Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, respect­fully submitted that the question presented
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Civil
Case No. 7143 - wherein the issue joined is whether the deed (Annex
"A"), upon which the herein plaintiff claims his right over the
afore-described parcel of land is a sale or a loan, is not yet untimely decided
because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the petition before the
Honorable Supreme Court, which is fully known by plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is a cause of action, according to our jurisprudence, when
the legal right of the plaintiff has been violated by the act or omission of
the defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, the legal right which the plaintiff asserts
over the above-stated parcel of land, has not been ultimately decided because
of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with the Supreme Court by the herein defendants <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and the heirs

legal rights over the property subject of this action has not been ultimately
decided due to the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the dismissal of the complaint in the Order quoted
above is proper and <span class="GramE">correct,</span> the same being in
accordance with law and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is well-established that in considering a motion to
dismiss the complaint on the ground that it states no cause of action, the
insufficiency must appear on the face of the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the facts alleged in the complaint and
no other should be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
motion to dismiss must admit hypothetically the truth of the facts alleged in
the complaint, and the test of the sufficiency of the facts alleged in a
complaint, to constitute a cause of action, is whether or not, admitting the
facts alleged<span class="GramE">,</span> the court could render a valid judgment
in accordance with the prayer of said complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the allegations of the complaint filed in C.C. Q-12845 and
now under review, We find that the decision in C.C. No. 7143 dated October 21,
1966 referred to in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">paragraph 14 of
said complaint, had not become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This can be inferred from the allegation in
paragraph 22 thereof that "said decision (Annex "D") cannot be
executed notwithstanding the Order of Special Execution issued in said Civil
Case No. 7143 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The right of the plaintiff, now the petitioner, to the two (2)
hectare land having been questioned by the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
spouses in C.C. 7143 who claim that the transaction between them was a loan and
not a sale and that the loan had already been paid, the appeal interposed by
the <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> spouses to the Court of Appeals and
ultimately to the Supreme Court in <i>certiorari</i> proceedings had not
resolve finally the right of the petitioner to the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In other words, the filing
of the complaint in Civil Case No.</span> Q-12845 was premature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The action presented by petitioner in his
complaint below is groundless and should be dismissed, there being no final and
conclusive judicial pronouncement that the legal right of the petitioner had
been violated by the act or omission of the private respondents.</p>

<blockquote>"It is a rule of law to which there is, perhaps, no exception,
either at law or in equity, that to recover at all there must be some cause of
action at the commencement of the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As observed by counsel for <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, there
are reasons of public policy why there should be no needless haste in bringing
up litigation, and why people who are in no default and against whom there is
as yet no cause of action should not be summoned before the public tribunals to
answer complaints which are groundless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
say groundless because if the action is immature, it should not be entertained,
and an action prematurely brought is a groundless suit." (Justice Laurel
in <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Mine Exploration Co. vs. C. Harris, et
al., 68 Phil. 113, 120-121).</blockquote>
