<p class="BODY">In their Motion seeking reconsideration of the Order of <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="3">25 March 1980</st1:date>, petitioners stressed

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="5">10 May 1980</st1:date>,
the Board of Directors of MOELCI II held a special meeting and passed
Resolution No. 121, S-80, imple­menting NEA Circular No. 18 and declaring
private respondent's position as member of the Board of Directors of MOELCI II
vacant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 June 1980, upon a Motion for Reconsideration, re­spondent
Judge set aside the Order of the vacation Judge, dated 8 May 1980, in effect
reviving the Restraining Order, on the ground that, as "councilor" of
<span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City, section 21 of <span style="">PD </span>No. 269 itself exempts private respondent from the prohibition
imposed on elective officials to become Directors of electric cooperatives.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="9">29 September 1980</st1:date> by petitioners, through the Solicitor
General, advancing the view that Courts of First Instance have no jurisdiction
to issue a Restraining Order and that respondent Judge had committed grave
abuse of discretion in issuing the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="10"><span style="">10
 October 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> we
required respondents to submit </span>an Answer and issued a Restraining Order
enjoining respondents from enforcing the Order of the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
dated <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="6">6 June 1980</st1:date> and from
conducting further proceedings in the case below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Borje</span>
has filed his Answer, petitioners have submitted their Reply, and on 2 February
1981, <span style="">we </span>resolved to give due
course to the Petition and to consider the case submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find that respondent
Judge gravely abused his dis­cretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, in
issuing the various Restraining Orders, the last of which was dated 6 June
1980.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent has shown
no clear and explicit right to the position of Director of MOELCI II and is,
therefore, not entitled to a Restraining Order, which partook of the nature of
a mandatory Injunction, commanding as it did that private respondent be
retained in his position as such Director.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By having been elected member of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panglunsod</span> of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City,
private respondent rendered himself ineligible to continue serving as a
Director of MOELCI II by virtue of the clear mandate of PD No. 269 providing
that except for "barrio captains and councilors", elective officials
are ineligible to become officers and/or directors of any coop­erative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear to us that the term barrio
modifies both captains and councilors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, the MOELCI II By-laws explic­itly state that no person can
remain a member of the Board if </span>he "holds an elective office above
the level of barrio captain."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent's
argument that PD 269 (sec. 21) does not prohibit Board members of a cooperative
from continuing in their position prior to their election, and that pursuant to
section 24 of PD No. 269 he is entitled, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">Director, "to
hold office for the term for which he is elected and until his successor is
elected and qualified," is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eligibility to an office should be construed as of a continuing nature
and must exist </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">the commencement of the term and during
occupancy of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
private respondent may have been qualified at the time he assumed the
Directorship is not suf­ficient to entitle him to continue holding office, if
during the continuance of his incumbency he ceases to be qualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent was qualified to become a
director of MOELCI II at the time of the commencement of his term, but his election
as member of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglunsod</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City, and his subsequent assumption of
office, disqualified him to continue as such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, it should be
recalled that when respondent Judge issued the Restraining Order of 6 June
1980, NEA Memorandum Circular No. 18 had already been implemented by the MOELCI
Board in the latter's Resolution No. 121, passed on 10 May 1980, </span>declaring
the position of private respondent, <span style="">as
Director, </span>vacant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strictly
speaking therefore, there was no longer any position which private respondent
could retain.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding that respondent Judge acted with grave
abuse of discretion tantamount to lack of jurisdiction in issuing the
Restraining Order, dated 6 June 1980, the said Order is hereby annulled and set
aside, and the Petition in Special Civil Case No. 0511 of the Court below
hereby ordered dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temporary
Restraining Order heretofore issued by this Court is hereby made permanent.</p>

<p class="BODY">No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
