<p class="BODY"><span>Subject of the petition is the Order dated </span><st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1978"><span>May 12, 1978</span></st1:date><span> of the 
then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Branch V, 
dismissing without prejudice, Civil Case No. SM-234, entitled 
"</span><st1:place><span class="style1"><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of 
</span><em><st1:placename>Norzagaray</st1:placename></em></st1:place><span style="font-style: italic;"> vs. Jose Serapio, et. al.</span><span>".<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">Civil Case No.</span> SM-234 </span><span>is 
</span><span>an expropriation proceeding filed by the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> which the public respondent Judge dismissed on 
the ground that at the time the original complaint was filed, the plaintiff 
municipality had not yet obtained the requisite authority from the Department 
Head or Office of the President, as required in Section 2245 of the Revised 
Administrative Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent </span>Judge <span>held that 
</span>—</p>
<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> since the 
filing of the amended complaint to cure this fatal defect, by submitting the 
requisite authority from the Office of the President as required by Section 2245 
of the Revised Administrative Code, did not vest jurisdiction with this Court 
which it never had acquired even from the very filing of the original complaint 
- - x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> orders this case 
dismissed without prejudice." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, <span>p. </span>19).</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">For municipalities, the municipal council shall exercise the right 
of eminent domain with the approval of the President [Sec. 2245 (h), Revised 
Administrative Code].</p>
<p class="BODY">The factual and procedural antecedents which led to the filing of 
this petition are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>On <st1:date month="12" day="7" year="1968">December 7, 1968</st1:date>, 
petitioner (then called Barrio <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span>) filed with 
the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Branch V, 
<span class="GramE">an</span> action for injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 
SM-210, entitled <em>Barrio Matictic vs. Zosimo</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Serapio</em></span><em>, et al.</em>, praying therein that the 
defendants (who are the private respondents in the <span>instant case) be 
enjoined from placing obstructions and closing the <em>barrio</em> road and to 
allow plaintiff barrio to remove the obstructions and repair the barrio road 
(the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion-Tomana-Canyakan</span> barrio road) so as "to 
enable the people and motorized vehicles the free use thereof and convenient 
passage through it.";<o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>On January 28, 1969, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span> filed a 
motion to dismiss the case on the ground that an expropriation proceeding, not 
an injunction, is the better remedy and on the same date, the Court, Judge <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span> then 
presiding, issued the corresponding order dismissing the 
case;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li><span></span>However, and also on January 28, 1969, a complaint for Eminent 
Domain was filed by the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> 
with the same court, docketed as Civil Case No. SM-234, CFI, Branch I, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, and entitled 
"<st1:place><st1:placetype><em>Municipality</em></st1:placetype><em> of 
<st1:placename>Norzagaray</st1:placename></em></st1:place><em> vs. Jose Serapio, 
et al.</em>" Said case involves the same property of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> defendants that was the subject of Civil Case 
No. SM-210 hereinabove referred to;<br><br></li><li>The defendants in Civil Case No. SM-234, Jose <span class="SpellE">Serapio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacida</span>, on <span class="SpellE">Februry</span> 5, 1979, filed 
a Motion to Dismiss alleging that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> has no jurisdiction over the subject of the action; 
that the complaint states no cause of action; and that plaintiff (municipality 
of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>) has no capacity to sue;<br><br></li><li><span></span>On <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1969">February 11, 
1969</st1:date>, upon motion of plaintiff, the Court issued an order allowing 
plaintiff to take possession of the property subject of the expropriation 
proceedings upon deposit of the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,682.00</span>;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>On <st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1969">February 14, 1969</st1:date>, 
defendants <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Serapio</span>-Merced and <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> 
Merced filed through counsel a Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> the 
expropriation case on several grounds.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their principal contention 
is that the plaintiff municipality, in the absence of an approval from the 
Office of the President, may not properly file the subject expropriation 
case;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>On <st1:date month="3" day="14" year="1969">March 14, 1969</st1:date>, 
plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging therein that it had obtained 
authority from the Office of the President to institute expropriation 
proceedings. <span>&nbsp;</span>Private respondents, Jose <span class="SpellE">Serapio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacida</span>, in turn, filed an Amended Motion <span>to Dismiss, 
dated March 19, 1969, reiterating therein plaintiff’s lack of cause of action 
and that a subsequent </span>authorization, even if obtained, would not cure the 
jurisdictional defect attaching to the plaintiff's complaint when the subject 
case was initially filed;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li><span></span>On August 18 and 19, 1969, the Court issued orders requiring 
plaintiff municipality to submit plans of the land to be expropriated, duly 
approved by the Bureau of Lands;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>On <st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1970">January 22, 1970</st1:date>, for 
failure of the plaintiff to comply with the orders of August 18 and 19, 1969, 
the Court issued an order dismissing said Civil Case No. SM-234 for failure of 
plaintiff to take the necessary steps to prosecute its 
case;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>Said order of dismissal, however, upon appeal by the municipality, was 
reversed by the Court of Appeals in its decision dated <st1:date month="1" day="5" year="1973">January 5, 1973</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> was ordered to proceed with the 
expropriation case pursuant to Sec. 3, Rule 67 of <span>the Rules of 
Court;<o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>The case went back to the court <em>a quo</em><span>, </span>with Judge J.M. 
<span class="SpellE">Elbinias</span> presiding (now Associate Justice of the Court 
of Appeals).<span>&nbsp; </span>But at this point of time the municipal mayor of 
<span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> displayed reluctance to prosecute the 
<span>said case </span>for eminent domain.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span>he 
requested the Municipal Council to withdraw </span><span>the expropriation 
proceedings.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Municipal Council, however, refused to accede to 
the wishes of the mayor; (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
98-99)<o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>It appear then that a motion to dismiss dated <span>April </span><span>3, 
</span><span>1978 </span><span>was </span>once more filed by the defendants 
(pri<span>vate respondents herein) who reiterated their challenge to the 
jurisdiction of the said trial court based on their argument that the initial 
lack of jurisdiction of a court cannot be cured by the filing of an amended 
complaint;<o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>Petitioner herein, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span>, chagrined and confronted by the attitude of 
<span>its mayor, </span>and on its averment that the result of the expropriation 
case will greatly affect the social and economic development of <span>the 
</span>area in and around <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span>, filed on <st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1978">January 26, 1978</st1:date> a Motion for Intervention in Civil Case 
No. <span class="GramE">SM-234.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge issued an 
order taking notice of the Motion for Intervention and denied the motion to 
dismiss filed by the defendants until the motion for intervention shall have 
been considered by the trial court;<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>On May 12, 1978, respondent Judge, without taking any further action on 
petitioner's motion for intervention, issued an order dismissing, but without 
prejudice, the expropriation case — Civil Case <span>No. </span>SM-234, on the 
singular reason that at the time the expropriation case was initially filed 
there was no showing of any prior Presidential approval — a requisite that 
should have been <span>first </span>complied with, pursuant to Section 2245 of 
the Revised Administrative Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration of 
this decision was filed by plaintiff municipality.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>It 
</span>insisted that presidential approval was, after all, secured and that this 
fact was alleged <span>in the plaintiff's amended complaint.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said 
motion for reconsideration was, however, denied in the order of the court below, 
dated </span><st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1978"><span>January 
</span><span>15, 1978</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This order 
</span>closed the case for the plaintiff 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span></st1:placename></st1:place> inasmuch as it no 
longer appealed said order of <span>dismissal.</span></li></ol>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span>, in this <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> case 
before us, simply complains that in <span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>these orders, dated May 12, 1978 and June 15, 1978 
(Annexes CC and DD) no resolution or ruling was made by respondent Judge with 
respect to its motion for intervention which was mentioned in the order dated 
January 26, 1978 (Annex AA) <span style="font-style: italic;">leaving 
petitioner</span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Barangay</em></span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">no personality to take part in the case</span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 9).<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it filed 
the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> to compel 
respondent Judge to allow and admit its complaint in intervention.</p>
<p class="BODY">This petition was given due course, under the resolution of this 
Court, dated January 15, 1979 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 153) 
and on February 2, 1979, a temporary restraining order was issued enjoining 
respondents from exacting, charging and collecting toll fees for the use of the 
feeder road, subject of the expropriation proceedings until further orders from 
this Court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 158).</p>
<p class="BODY">The petition of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span> is manifestly untenable.</p>
<p class="BODY">Regarding the annulment and setting aside of the May 12, 1978 and 
June 15, 1979 orders of the public respondent, dismissing the expropriation 
proceedings, the proper party to appeal the same or seek a review of such 
dismissal, would be the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Barrio <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span>, which is a different political entity, and 
although a part and parcel of the aforesaid municipality, has no legal 
personality to question the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> orders because 
by itself, it may n<span>ot continue </span>the expropriation case.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It must be considered that the subject orders of the court <em>a quo</em> 
were not appealed by the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> 
of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
dismissal of the expropriation case, insofar as said municipality is concerned, 
became final.<span>&nbsp; </span>The expropriation case ceased to exist and there is 
consequently no more proceeding wherein <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span> may possibly intervene.</p>
<p class="BODY">An intervention has been regarded as merely “collateral or 
accessory or ancillary to the principal action and not an independent 
proceeding; an interlocutory proceeding dependent on and subsidiary to, the case 
between the original parties".<span>&nbsp; </span>(Francisco, Rules of Court, 
<span>Vol. </span>I, p. 721).<span>&nbsp; </span>With the final dismissal of the 
original action, the complaint in intervention can no longer be acted 
upon.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Clareza</em></span><em> vs. Rosales</em>, 2 SCRA 455, 457-458, 
it was stated that:</p>
<blockquote>"That right of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> should 
merely be in aid of the right of the original party, like the plaintiffs in this 
case.<span>&nbsp; </span>As this right of the plaintiffs had ceased to <span>exist, 
</span>there is nothing to aid or fight for.<span>&nbsp; </span>So the right of 
intervention has ceased to exist."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Consequently, it will be illogical and of no useful purpose to 
grant or even consider further herein petitioner's prayer for the issuance of a 
writ of <i>mandamus</i> to compel the lower court to allow and admit the 
petitioner's complaint in intervention.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of the 
expropriation case has no less the inherent effect of also dismissing the motion 
for intervention which is but the unavoidable consequence.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We </span>are constrained to reject petitioner's averment 
that public respondent Judge "acted with grave and manifest abuse of 
discretion." Firstly, nothing is lost to the petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>If at all 
petitioner can rightfully establish that it is allowed by law to institute a 
separate and independent action of its own, then there would be no necessity for 
it to intervene in the case initiated by the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span></st1:placename></st1:place> <span>which is 
</span>now apparently no longer interested in continuing the expropriation 
proceedings.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of the expropriation case was without 
prejudice.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> can revive its action.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no 
need for <span>the proposed intervention of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Matictic</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>What it may do is to urge the 
municipality to file its case anew.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> has obtained authority for itself to pursue the 
action of eminent domain, then the more reason there is to refuse its 
intervention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Approximately, if the rights of the party seeking to intervene will 
not be prejudiced by any judgment in the case at bar <span>and that it may be 
<em>fully protected in a separate proceeding in court</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>, then the exercise of judicial 
discretion in denying a motion for intervention is deemed correctly made." <span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE"><em>Pflieder</em></span><em> vs. de 
Britanica</em>, L-19077, October 20, 1964, cited in 51 SCRA 
368).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing discussion indicating the lack of merit 
of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, it will follow that the writ of 
<i>mandamus</i> prayed for by petitioner cannot be granted for lack of legal 
basis.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span>,</span> the instant petition is hereby 
DENIED for lack of merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining order earlier 
issued in this case by the Court, dated <st1:date month="2" day="2" year="1979">February 2, 1979</st1:date>, is hereby lifted and dissolved.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
