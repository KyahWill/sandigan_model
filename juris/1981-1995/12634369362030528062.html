<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the
offenses charged. The cases were tried jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented as principal witnesses,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
four (4) of the five (5) private complainants, namely: Glenda <span class="SpellE">Elefante</span>, Bella <span class="SpellE">Bustria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jossie</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayaga</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>. All four
witnesses identified accused-appellant as the person who perpetrated the crimes
of Illegal Recruitment and <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first of the prosecution witnesses to testify was 30-year-old
high school graduate and housewife <b style="">GLENDA
ELEFANTE y RIVERA</b>, a native of San <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>. According to her, she met the spouses Nora and <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span> through a mutual
friend.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In August, 1989, during their second meeting, Nora <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span>
told Glenda that she (Nora) had already talked to accused-appellant, and that
if Glenda wanted to apply for work abroad, they could go to accused-appellant's
office in Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1989</st1:date>, Glenda
was brought by the <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span> spouses to
accused-appellant's office at <st1:street><st1:address>1010 A. <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.
There, Glenda and accused-appellant discussed the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
application as a factory worker in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which purportedly paid between five hundred ($500) and seven hundred US dollars

Accused-appellant asked Glenda to give an advance payment of ten thousand pesos
(P10,000.00) for the processing of her Taiwanese visa, and one thousand five
hundred pesos (P1,500.00) for the preparation of her passport. Glenda went home
to <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> to borrow the money. She gave it
personally to accused-appellant in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date month="8" day="27" year="1989">August 27, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused-appellant did not issue her any receipt.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
She was then told to wait a couple of weeks. When she returned to the office of
accused-appellant, her visa was still unavailable allegedly because of the
strictness of the Taiwanese Embassy.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

She was offered by accused-appellant a Job as a factory worker in <st1:country-region><st1:place>South

accused-appellant to pay an additional fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000.00) as
placement fee.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

Glenda together with two of her co-complainants, Bella <span class="SpellE">Bustria</span>

accused-appellant's office in <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>. Bella and <span class="SpellE">Jossie</span> paid to accused-appellant the amount of twenty five
thousand pesos (P25,000.00) each. The three were issued one receipt by a
certain Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, allegedly a secretary of the
accused-appellant. The receipt was placed in the name of Glenda and covered the
amount of sixty thousand pesos (P60,000.00). It was for the payment of Glenda's
ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) on <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="8">August
 27, 1989</st1:date>, and the twenty five thousand pesos (P25,000.00) payment

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1990</st1:date>,

  Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> on <st1:date month="2" day="16" year="1990">February 16, 1990</st1:date>. This promise was broken, however,
because on that date, Glenda was informed that accused-appellant was in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Even after accused-appellant returned, Glenda was not able to fly to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
purportedly because of the Chinese New Year celebration.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

who arrived from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
<span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> narrated to Glenda and the other
complainants how she almost died in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and how accused-appellant took her salary for one month. Fearing the same fate,
Glenda demanded from accused-appellant the return of her money.

Glenda then went to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) to
check if accused-appellant was a duly licensed recruiter. She found out that
accused-appellant had no authority to recruit workers for jobs abroad.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Glenda denied she owed accused-appellant
the amount of thirteen thousand pesos (P13,000.00), but admitted having
received the amount of five hundred pesos (P500.00) from a female secretary of
accused-appellant sometime in August, 1989.</p>

only second year high school. Bella testified that she came to learn of
accused-appellant through Nora <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span>. In one of
their conversations, Nora told her that accused-appellant could employ her
abroad. Nora accompanied her to the office of accused-appellant at <st1:street><st1:address>1010

She applied for a job as a factory worker in <st1:country-region><st1:place>South

Bella and <span class="SpellE">Jossie</span> paid to accused-appellant

secretary to issue a receipt covering their payments, and also the payment of
Glenda <span class="SpellE">Elefante</span> in the amount of ten thousand pesos
(P10,000.00). The receipt was made in the name of Glenda, and covered the

On that date, accused-appellant told Bella she could not leave for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> complained that she had a visa problem in <st1:country-region><st1:place>South

She was able to leave <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date month="11" day="8" year="1989">November 8, 1989</st1:date>. Upon arriving in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> was, however, made to work as a laundry
woman for about three months. At the end of that period, she was asked to
return to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for lack of a working visa.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
It turned out that accused-appellant provided <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
only with a fifteen-day re-entry permit, and not a working visa.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> stopped working on <st1:date month="2" day="10" year="1990">February 10, 1990</st1:date>. For about a month,
she was kept in a room by her Korean employer because she had no working visa.
Afterwards, she was again detained by the Korean immigration authorities. She
returned to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
only on <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1990</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> met her co-complainants and
informed them about her ordeal in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the defense of accused-appellant rests
mainly on denial and alibi. She alleged that she is not a recruiter, but an
importer/exporter and an authorized travel agent.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
She explained that the charges against her were due to the ill-will of privates
complainants. Complainant <span class="SpellE">Elefante</span> allegedly owed her
the amount of thirteen thousand pesos (P13,000.00). On the other hand,
complainants <span class="SpellE">Cayaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bustria</span>
got angry as she did not employ them as <span class="SpellE">househelpers</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant denied that she had a male secretary, or any
employee by the name of Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, whose signature
appeared in the receipt for sixty thousand pesos (P60,000.00). She also denied
that she was in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date month="12" day="27" year="1989">December 27, 1989</st1:date>. She said she was
in <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> on that date.
She likewise testified that, on the other material dates, she was not in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but in <st1:country-region><st1:place>South Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence adduced, the trial court convicted
accused-appellant of Illegal Recruitment and four (4) counts of <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>. The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of the appealed Decision reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in this automatic review of accused-appellant's conviction,
she submits:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

SUBMITTED FOR DECISION AND CONSIDERING THAT THE SOLE QUESTION SUBMITTED FOR

CORAL GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIMES OF ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT AND
ON FOUR (4) SEPARATE COUNTS OF ESTAFA.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Illegal recruitment is defined and penalized in Article 38 of the
Labor Code, as amended, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 38. Illegal recruitment. -- (a) Any recruitment
activities, including the prohibited practices under Article 34 of this Code to
be undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority shall be deemed
illegal and punishable under Article 39 of this Code. The Ministry of Labor and
Employment or any law enforcement officer may initiate complaints under this
Article.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate in
large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage, and
shall be penalized in accordance with Article 39 hereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried
out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring and/or confederating
with one another in carrying out any unlawful or illegal transaction,
enterprise car scheme defined under the first paragraph hereof. Illegal
recruitment is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3)
or more persons individually or as a group."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Further, Article 13(b) of the same Code states:</p>

<blockquote>"Any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting,
utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract
services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether
for profit or not. Provided that any person or entity which, in any manner,
offers for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in
recruitment and placement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crime of illegal recruitment has two elements, <span class="SpellE"><i style="">viz</i></span>: (1) that the
offender is a non-licensee or non-holder of authority to lawfully engage in the
recruitment and placement of workers; and (2) that the offender undertakes any
of the recruitment activities defined under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code, as
amended, or any prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the same
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, accused-appellant does not dispute that she
is neither a licensee nor a holder of any authority to engage in recruitment
and placement activities. It is likewise established that private complainants
were unaware of accused-<span class="SpellE">appelant's</span> lack of authority
when they transacted business with her. It was only later, when private complainants
sought the assistance of the POEA that they discovered accused-appellant's lack
of authority. In fine, the first element of the crime of illegal recruitment
was clearly proved in the case at bench.</p>

<p class="BODY">We next resolve whether the prosecution established the second
element of the offense of illegal recruitment, i.e., that accused-appellant
undertook any of the recruitment activities defined under Article 13(b) of the
Labor Code, as amended, or any of the prohibited activities defined under
Article 34 of the same code. Accused-appellant urged it was not she who
"recruited" private complainants, but Nora <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span>.
She alleged that <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span> brought them to her and that
they pleaded to be given jobs even only as <span class="SpellE">househelpers</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the submission of accused-appellant untenable. In the
first place, even assuming she did not directly recruit private complainants,
it is abundantly clear from their testimonies that <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span>
led them to believe she was acting for, or at least with the tacit consent of
accused-appellant. This belief was buttressed when accused-appellant made no
disclaimer to private complainants of <span class="SpellE">Rubias's</span>
authority when the latter accompanied them to accused-appellant's office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, even downgrading the participation of <span class="SpellE">Rubias</span> in the recruitment scheme, private complainants
proved that accused-appellant herself promised them jobs in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>. They
paid various sums of money to accused-appellant to take care of the expenses
for the processing of their passports and visas. It was even accused-appellant
who accompanied <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> to <st1:country-region><st1:place>South
  Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, accused-appellant contended that the trial court should
not have given credence to the testimonies of private complainants. She
dismissed them as fabrications, concocted due to their spite and ill-feelings
towards her. We cannot patronize this posturing for, as accurately observed by
the trial court, private complainants are plain housewives with no
sophisticated education. They did not know accused-appellant before their illegal
recruitment. They had no reason to harbor any spite against her. We therefore
find it far-fetched for private complainants to concoct a story that could
result in accused-appellant's life imprisonment for no other reason than that
she failed to accommodate their requests for employment. It is against human
nature and experience for strangers to conspire and accuse another stranger of
a most serious crime just to mollify their hurt feelings. The fact that private
complainants are hardly high school graduates and plain housewives from the
rural areas all the more militates against the imputation of any sinister
motive on their part.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also find no reason to disturb the trial court’s findings as
to the credibility of private complainants despite what accused-appellant
assailed as inconsistencies in their testimonies. Findings of fact of the trial
courts are given great weight unless it can be demonstrated that they
overlooked certain facts of substance or value which, if considered, will
affect the outcome of the case. In the instant case, we have no reason to
depart from the general rule for the alleged discrepancies alluded to by
accused-appellant, are slight and hardly relate to the material parts of the
testimonies of private complainants. Their testimonies were consistent in their
material sense and essence. It is universal rule of evidence that corroborative
testimonies to be credible, need not coincide on all aspect. Given the natural <span class="SpellE">frailities</span> of the human senses to absorb all details of an
event, the slight “inconsistencies” and variances in private complainants’
testimonies, far from weakening their probative value, served to strengthen
their credibility. Imperfect senses cannot be the source of perfect
testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that
accused-appellant violated Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code which
provides that <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is committed:</p>

<blockquote>“2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent
acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) By using fictitious name, or <i style="">falsely pretending to possess power</i>, influence, <i style="">qualifications</i>, property, credit,
agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by mean of other similar
deceits.” (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence is crystal clear that accused-appellant falsely
pretended to possess power (to employ private complainants abroad) and
qualification (as a licensed job recruiter) to deploy private complainants for
overseas employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the claim of accused-appellant that she was denied due
process has a hollow ring. The records show that the prosecution and the
defense presented evidence on accused-appellant’s petition for bail. On <st1:date month="9" day="21" year="1990">September 21, 1990</st1:date>, the trial court
issued the following Order, <span class="SpellE"><i style="">viz</i></span>:</p>

<blockquote>“The Petition for Bail of the accused is now submitted for the
resolution of the Court. These cases are hereby set, for the continuation of
the trial on <st1:date month="10" day="30" year="1990">October 30, 1990</st1:date>
at <st1:time hour="8" minute="30">8:30 o’clock</st1:time> in the morning for
the prosecution to adduce more evidence, and for the accused to adduce more
evidence, if so she opts, in addition to the evidence already in the record.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the hearing of <st1:date month="12" day="18" year="1990">December
 18, 1990</st1:date>, the trial court issued another Order, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“When these cases were called for continuance of the trial on the
merits, the parties agreed that whatever evidences they have adduced during the
hearing in the ‘Petition for Bail’ will constitute their evidence on the merits
of these cases. The parties further manifested to the Court that they are no
longer adducing any other evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These cases are now submitted for the decision of the Court. The
promulgation of the Decision of the court is set on <st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1991">January 15, 1991</st1:date> at <st1:time hour="8" minute="30">8:30
 o’clock</st1:time> in the morning.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Order was not contested by
accused-appellant. She was then convicted by the trial court on <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1991">January 31, 1991</st1:date>. For
accused-appellant now to contend she was not aware of the import of these
Orders is to stretch judicial credulity too much. A journalism graduate and a
third year law student, accused-appellant cannot claim such uncaring ignorance.
But more important, accused-appellant gives no inkling of the evidence which
she would have presented if the trial court did not consider her case submitted
for decision on <st1:date month="12" day="18" year="1990">December 18, 1990</st1:date>.</p>
