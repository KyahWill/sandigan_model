				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Customs Case No. 813, the Commissioner of Customs rendered a
decision on August 11, 1969, declaring illegal the seizure by elements of the
Philippine Navy of the M/V "<span class="SpellE">Hyojin</span> <span class="SpellE">Maru</span>" a vessel of Japanese registry, and ordered the
release of the vessel and its cargo to the claimants, Chan Chiu On and Cheung
I.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Return of the cargo as thus ordered was effected pursuant to a directive of the
Secretary of Finance dated February 5, 1970.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Release of the vessel, however, was never <span class="GramE">effected</span>; it
sank while yet in the custody of the Bureau of Customs, and requests by the
Bureau to the Philippine Navy and the CADA to <span class="SpellE">refloat</span>
or salvage the ship could not be complied with for lack of funds.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Chan Chiu On and Cheung I then filed a claim with the Commission
on Audit for the payment of the value of the vessel.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Acting thereon "(b)y authority of the Acting Chairman," Mr. Rogelio
B. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, Manager, Technical Service Office of the
COA, denied the claim for the reasons set forth in his registered letter to the
claimants’ lawyer dated November 3, 1977 -- captioned "Decision No.
77-142."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Another letter, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1977</st1:date>,
this time signed by Acting COA Chairman Francisco S. <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>,
was also sent to claimants' counsel, Atty. Juan David, enclosing "a copy
of Decision No. 77-142 of this Commission, contained in a letter dated <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1977</st1:date>, which is
self-explanatory."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. David moved for reconsideration by letter dated <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting COA Chairman <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>
denied the motion, in his own letter dated <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1978</st1:date> on the ground that it had been filed beyond
the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of 30 days from the date of
receipt of a copy of the subject Decision which, in consequence, had
"already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In a letter dated May 10, 1978, Mr. David replied that said Decision No. 77-142
-- rendered only by the Manager, Technical Service Office of the COA, and
"not (by) the Acting Chairman, much less ** the Commission on Audit"
-- was void because the matter could validly be acted upon only by "the
Commission on Audit duly constituted, by the appointment and qualification of
its Chairman and two Commissioners," "as specifically provided by
Section 2, Article XII-D of the (1973) Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span> wrote back on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1978</st1:date> informing Mr. David
that "this Commission finds no cogent reason that would justify a reversal
of its stand on the matter."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again Atty. David moved for reconsideration, by letter dated
April 5, 1979, reiterating the view that Acting Chairman <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>
lacked constitutional authority to act on the claim on its merits, and
requesting that "the same be submitted for resolution by the Commission on
Audit, after the appointment of the two (2) commissioners thereof, as required
by Section 2, Article XII-D of the Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In another communication dated <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="4">April
 20, 1981</st1:date>, Mr. David reiterated his request that his application for
reconsideration be acted on, considering that "a Commissioner has
(already) been appointed as member of said Commission." It does not appear
that either letter was acted on.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 17, 1986, the Commission on Audit having been fully
constituted with the appointment of the Chairman and two (2) members, Mr. David
wrote still another letter to it,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
drawing attention once again to his clients' claim for payment of the
"nominal depreciated value ** (of their vessel) in the sum of
US$50,000.00, plus the amount corresponding to legal interest." An
acceptable alternative based on "established practice," according to
David, would be the conveyance to his clients by the Bureau of Customs of
"forfeited merchandise, the value of which shall correspond to the nominal
depreciated value of said vessel, plus legal interest * <span class="GramE">*

addressed "to the Auditor, Bureau of Customs," Chairman <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> C. Domingo, acting "FOR THE COMMISSION,"
reconsidered Decision No. 77-142 of Acting Commissioner of Audit <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>, supra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
declared <span style="">that the vessel </span>sank
while in illegal custody of the Bureau of Customs, which "should have
pre-eminently taken adequate measures to preserve" it but did not; hence,
he declared that "this Commission will interpose no objection" to the
instant claim, subject to the usual auditing and accounting requirements."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mison</span> sought clarification
of "the legal implication of the 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1987</st1:date>,"
in two (2) letters dated <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="11">November 8,
 1988</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="11">November 16,

The response was a letter dated <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="5">May
 19, 1989</st1:date>, entitled <i style="">"COA
Decision No. 992,"</i><span style=""> </span>signed

Said COA Decision No. 992 pointed out that the earlier decision, No. 77-142,
was "open to question and cannot be recognized by the present
Commission" because signed merely by the then Manager of the Technical
Service Office," who evidently "was not acting for the Commission but
only for the then Acting Chairman." It therefore held that the 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="6">June
 22, 1987</st1:date> should be "deemed for all legal intents and purposes
as the <u><span style="">final</span></u> decision on
the matter * <span class="GramE">* ."</span> This letter -­- Decision No.
992 -- was received by the Bureau of Customs on <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The motion was denied by letter dated October 20, 1989, denominated <i style="">"COA Decision No. 1053," </i>also
signed by the Chairman and the two (2) Members of the Commission, notice of
which was received by the petitioner on December 4, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner seasonably filed with this Court a petition for <i>certiorari</i><span style=""> </span>to nullify said COA Decisions No.
992 and 1053, pursuant to Section 7, Article IX of the 1987 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">1. The first point that the petitioner would make is that COA
Decision No. 77-142, although signed only by the Manager, Technical Service
Office of the COA, was ratified or <i style="">made
valid</i><span style=""> </span>because it “was
adopted <i style="">in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></i><span style=""> </span>as a decision of the COA in the
letters dated December 9, 1977, April 17, 1978, and August 24, 1978 of then COA
Chairman Francisco T. <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>, Jr. to Atty. Juan T.
David." The point cannot be conceded.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place the "<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>
decision" was void <span class="SpellE"><i style="">ab</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
manager of the COA Technical Service Office, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>
obviously had no power whatever to render and promulgate a decision of or for
the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, even the
Chairman, alone, had not that power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
clearly set out in the Constitution then in force, the power was lodged in the
Commission on Audit, "composed of a Chairman and two Commissioners."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the Commission, as a collegial body, which then as now, had the
jurisdiction to "(d)<span class="SpellE">ecide</span> any case brought
before it within sixty days from the date of its submission for
resolution," subject to review by the Supreme Court on <i>certiorari.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the adoption or ratification of the <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>
decision by the Acting COA Chairman was inconsequential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ratification cannot validate an act void <span class="SpellE"><i style="">ab</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">initio</span> </i>because
done absolutely without authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
act has to be done anew by the person or entity duly endowed with authority to
do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even conceding the contrary, no proper ratification or
validation could have been effected by the Acting Chairman since he was not the
Commission, and he himself had no power to decide any case brought before the
Commission, that power, to repeat, being lodged only in the Commission itself,
as a collegial body.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, the proposition advocated in this connection
that Chairman Domingo may no longer question the validity of the <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> Decision" (No. 77-142) because in assailing
it, he had referred to it as "a decision of the Commission on Audit and
not merely of its then Acting Chairman," is so patently unmeritorious as
to deserve scant consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The petitioner argues that to sanction the foregoing principle
would result in the invalidation of "hundreds of decisions and orders
signed by or signed by authority of the Acting Chairman <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>
(alone)," considering that there was an appreciable interval during which
only an Acting Chairman had been designated and no other Commissioner had been
appointed or was otherwise acting as such.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It suffices to rule, as this Court has already had occasion to in an
analogous case, that the principle should logically apply only to those
particular instances where there was a timely and specific challenge to the
authority of the Acting COA Chairman to exercise the power of adjudication or
decision; it should not affect all other cases where the parties expressly or
by implication accepted the adjudicative authority of the Chairman.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">3. The petitioner next contends that the objection -- that the
"<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> Decision" was "technically invalid
due to ** lack of collegiality" -- was waived by failure of Atty. David to
raise it in his motion for reconsideration, in which motion he confined his
arguments to the merits of the decision, and additionally, by his failure,
after denial of his motion for reconsideration, to appeal to the Supreme Court,
with the result that the judgment became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
as of October 7, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is also without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows ­-- although the petition
does not allege<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
-- that in a letter dated May 10, 1978, Mr. David did dispute Decision No.
77-142 because rendered only by the Manager, Technical Service Office of the
COA, and "not (by) the Acting Chairman, much less ** the Commission on
Audit" "duly constituted, by the appointment and qualification of its
Chairman and two Commissioners," "as specifically provided by Section
2, Article XII-D of the (1973) Constitution." He reiterated the challenge
to Acting Chairman <span class="SpellE">Tantuico's</span> constitutional
authority to act on the claim on its merits, in his letter dated April 5, 1979,
and requested that "the same be submitted for resolution by the Commission
on Audit, after the appointment of the two (2) commissioners thereof, as
required by Section 2, Article XII-D of the Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
And in another communication dated April 20, 1981, Mr. David once more
requested that his application for reconsideration be acted on collegially,
considering that "a Commissioner has (already) been appointed as member of
said Commission."</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it must be made clear that the <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>
Decision was not merely "technically invalid," as the petitioner
describes it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <i style="">substantively void <span class="SpellE">ab</span>
<span class="SpellE">initio</span>, </i>because rendered without
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had an essential
inherent defect that could not be cured or waived.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. The petitioner also maintains that if the <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>
<span class="GramE">Decision,</span> or Decision No. 77-142 be held void because
adopted and signed only by Acting COA Chairman <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>,
then the decision embodied in the 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1987</st1:date>, signed
only by incumbent COA Chairman Domingo, should also be pronounced void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no parity in situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, when Decision No. 77-142
was rendered, there was no commissioner in the Commission on Audit except the
Acting Chairman himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, when the 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1987</st1:date> was rendered, there
were two (2) members of the Commission:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the Chairman, and Commissioner Fernandez, clearly a number sufficient to
satisfy the constitutional requirement for collegial action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is made clear in said 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> that the decision therein embodied was that of
the Commission, composed of Chairman Domingo and Commissioner Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrase therefore, by which Chairman
Domingo describes the capacity in which he acted, i.e., "FOR THE
COMMISSION," must be taken as entirely accurate, not only because of the
familiar presumption of regularity of performance of official functions, but
because the records do show Commissioner Fernandez’ full concurrence with the
decision in said <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, said 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
was ratified and reaffirmed by <i style=""><u>"COA
Decision No. 992</u>" </i>of May 19, 1989 signed by "the full
complement of three (3) members of the Commission on Audit,"<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect <i style="">inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i><span style=""> </span>that the 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated June 22, 1987 (of Chairman Domingo and Commissioner Fernandez) should be
"deemed for all legal intents and purposes as the <u>final</u> decision on
the matter * <span class="GramE">* ."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appears that not only does the petition fail to show any
grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent Commission in the
rendition of its decision embodied in the 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated June 22, 1987 and its Decision No. 992 of May 19, 1989, but that those
judgments are in fact in accord with the relevant facts and applicable legal
principles.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit,
without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
