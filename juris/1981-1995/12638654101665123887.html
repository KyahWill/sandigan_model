				G.R. No. 93867, December 18, 1990</h4>
				<H3>SIXTO S. BRILLANTES, JR., PETITIONER, VS. HAYDEE B. YORAC, IN HER CAPACITY AS ACTING CHAIRÂ­PERSON OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner is challenging
the designation by the President of the Philippines of Associate Commissioner
Haydee B. Yorac as Acting Chairman of the Commission on Elections, in place of
Chairman Hilario B. Davide, who had been named chairman of the fact-finding
commission to investigate the December 1989 </span><u><span style="">coup</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">d'etat</span></u><span style=""> attempt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The qualifications of the
respondent are conceded by the petitioner and are not in issue in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is </span>the power of the
President of the Philippines to make the challenged designation in view <span style="">of </span>the status of the Commission on
Elections as an independent constitutional <span style="">body </span>and the specific provision of Article IX-C, Section 1(2) of
the Constitution that "(I)n no case shall any Member (of the Commission on
Elections) be appointed or designated in a temporary or acting capacity."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner invokes
the case of Nacionalista Party v. Bautista, 85 Phil. 101, where President
Elpidio Quirino designated the Solicitor General as acting member of the
Commission on Elections and the Court revoked the designation as contrary to
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also alleged
that the respondent is not even the senior member of the Commission on
Elections, being outranked </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Associate
Commissioner Alfredo E. Abueg, Jr.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner contends
that the choice of the Acting Chairman of the Commission on Elections is an
internal matter that should be resolved by the members themselves and that the
intrusion of the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> violates their independence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cites the practice in this Court, where
the senior Associate Justice serves as Acting Chief Justice in the absence of
the Chief Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No designation from
the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> is necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>his Comment, the
Solicitor General argues that no such designation is necessary in the case of
the Supreme Court because the temporary succession cited is provided for in
Section 12 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A similar <span style="">rule is found in
Section 5 of BP 129 for the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no such arrangement, however, in the case of the Commission on
Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The designation made by the
President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> should therefore be sustained for reasons of
"administrative expediency," to prevent disruption of the functions
of the COMELEC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Expediency is a dubious
justification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may </span><span style="">also </span><span style="">be an overstatement to suggest that the operations </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">Commission on Elections would have been disturbed or stalemated if the
President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> had not stepped in and designated an Acting
Chairman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There did not seem to be any
such problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, even
assuming that difficulty, we do not agree that "only the President (could)
act to fill the hiatus," as the Solicitor General maintains.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article IX-A, Section 1,
of the Constitution expressly describes all the Constitutional Commissions as
"independent." Although essentially executive in nature, they are not
under the control of the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> in the discharge of their respective
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of these Commissions
conducts its own proceedings under the applicable laws and its own rules and in
the exercise of </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">own discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its decisions, orders and rulings are subject
only to review on </span><i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">by
this Court as provided by the Constitution in Article IX-A, Section 7.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The choice of a temporary
chairman in the absence of the regular chairman comes under that
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That discretion cannot be
exercised for it, even with its consent, by the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A designation as Acting Chairman is by its very terms essentially
temporary and therefore revocable at will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No cause need be established to justify its revocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming its validity, the designation of the
respondent as Acting Chairman of the Commission on Elections may be withdrawn
by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
at any time and for whatever reason she sees fit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is doubtful if the respondent, having
accepted such designation, will not be estopped from challenging its
withdrawal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, as the Solicitor General points out, that the
respondent cannot be removed at will<span style=""> </span>from
her permanent position as Associate Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>is
no less true, however, that she <span style="">can </span>be
replaced as Acting Chairman, with or without cause, and <span style="">thus </span>deprived of the powers and perquisites of that temporary
position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">lack </span>of a
statutory rule covering the situation at bar is no justification for the
Presiden<span style="">t</span> of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to fill the void by extending the temporary designation in favor of the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is still <span style="">a </span>government of laws and not of
men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem allegedly sought to be
corrected, if it existed at all, did not call for presidential action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation could have been handled by the
members of the Commission on Elections themselves <span style="">wi</span>thout the participation of the President, however well-meaning.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the choice of the Acting Chairman, the members of the <span style="">Commission </span>on Elections would most
likely have been guided <span style="">by </span>the
seniority rule as they themselves would have <span style="">appreciated it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
that choice and the basis thereof were for them and not the President to make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court has not the
slightest doubt that the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> was moved only by the best of motives when
she issued the challenged designation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But </span>while conceding her goodwill, we cannot sustain her act
because it conflicts with the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, even as this Court revoked the designation in the Bautista case,
so too must it annul the designation in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Constitution provides
for many safeguards to the independence of the Commission on Elections,
foremost among which is the security of tenure of its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That guaranty is not available to the
respondent as Acting Chairman of the Commissions on Elections by designation of
the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the designation by the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> of respondent Haydee B. Yorac as Acting
Chairman of the Commissions on Elections is declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL, and the
respondent is hereby ordered to desist from serving as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is without prejudice to the incumbent
Associate Commissioners of the Commission on Elections restoring her to the
same position if they so desire, or </span>choosing <span style="">another member in her place, pending the appointment of a permanent
Chairman by the President of the Philippines with the consent of the Commission
on </span>Appointments.</p>
