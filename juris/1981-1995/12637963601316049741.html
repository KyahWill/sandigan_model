				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">When a person's house is razed, the fire usually burns down the
efforts of a lifetime and forecloses hope for the suddenly somber future.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vanished abode becomes a charred and
painful memory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where once stood a home,
there is now, in the sighing wisps of smoke, only a gray desolation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dying embers leave ashes in the heart.</p>

<p class="BODY">For peace of mind and as a hedge against possible loss, many
people now secure fire insurance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is an <span class="SpellE">aleatory</span> contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By such insurance, the insured in effect
wagers that his house will be burned, with the insurer assuring him against the
loss, for a fee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the house does burn,
the insured, while losing his house, wins the wager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prize is the recompense to be given by
the insurer to make good the loss the insured has sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be a pity then if, having lost his house, the insured
were also to lose the payment he expects to recover for such loss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it is his fault that he cannot
collect, as where there is a defect imputable to him in the insurance
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, the reason may be
an unjust refusal of the insurer to acknowledge <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>just obligation, as has happened many times.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the private respondent has been sustained by
the Insurance Commission in her claim for compensation for her burned
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner is now before
us to dispute the decision,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>on the ground that there was no valid
insurance contract at the time of the loss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The chronology of the relevant antecedent facts is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1981</st1:date>,
the petitioner (hereinafter called MICO) issued to the private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>, Fire Insurance
Policy No. F-001-17212 on her property for the amount of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
effective <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1981</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1981</st1:date>,
MICO allegedly canceled the policy for non-payment of the premium and sent the
corresponding notice to <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1981</st1:date>,
payment of the premium from <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span> was received by
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Adora</span>, agent of MICO.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1982</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Adora</span> remitted this payment to MICO, together with
other payments.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1982</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pinca's</span> property was completely burned.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1982</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pinca's</span> payment was returned by MICO to <span class="SpellE">Adora</span> on the ground that her policy had been canceled
earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Adora</span>
refused to accept it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In due time, <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>
made the requisite demands for payment, which MICO rejected.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then went to the Insurance
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is because she was
ultimately sustained by the public respondent that the petitioner has come to
us for relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the procedural viewpoint alone, the petition must be
rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is stillborn.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that notice of the decision of the public
respondent dated <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1982</st1:date>,
was received by MICO on <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1982</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1982</st1:date>, it filed
a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1982</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Notice of this denial was received by MICO on <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1982</st1:date>, as evidenced by Annex "1," duly
authenticated by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Insurance
Commission.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> The instant petition was filed with this
Court on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The position of the petitioner is that the petition is governed
by Section 416 of the Insurance Code giving it thirty days within which to
appeal by <i><u>certiorari</u></i> to this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, it also invokes Rule 45 of the
Rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For their part, the public and private
respondents insist that the applicable law is B.P. 129, which they say governs
not only courts of justice but also quasi-judicial bodies like the Insurance
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The period for appeal under
this law is also fifteen days, as under Rule 45.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal date is the date the notice of the denial of the
motion for reconsideration was received by MICO.</p>

<p class="BODY">MICO avers this was <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="6">June
 18, 1982</st1:date>, and offers in evidence its Annex "B,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which is a copy of the Order of <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1982</st1:date>, with a signed rubber-stamped notation on the upper
left-hand corner that it was received on <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1982</st1:date>, by its legal department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not indicate from whom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the bottom, significantly, there is
another <span class="GramE">signature under which are</span> the ciphers "<st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="6">6-13-82</st1:date>," for which no
explanation has been given.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against this document, the private respondent points in her Annex
"1,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the authenticated copy of the same Order with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>rubber-stamped notation at the
bottom <span class="GramE">thereof indicating</span> that it was received for the
Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. by J. <span class="SpellE">Gotladera</span> on "<st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="6">6-13-82</st1:date>." The signature may or
may not have been written by the same person who signed at the bottom of the
petitioner's Annex "B."</p>

<p class="BODY">Between the two dates, the court chooses to believe <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1982</st1:date>, not only because the
numbers "<st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="6">6-13-82</st1:date>"
appear on both annexes but also because it is the date authenticated by the
administrative division of the Insurance Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Annex "B" is at worst self-serving;
at best, it might only indicate that it was received on <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1982</st1:date>, by the legal department of MICO,
after it had been received earlier by some other of its personnel on <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever the reason for the delay in transmitting
it to the legal department <span class="GramE">need</span> not detain us here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 416 of the Insurance Code, the period for appeal is
thirty days from notice of the decision of the Insurance Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner filed its motion for
reconsideration on <st1:date year="1981" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1981</st1:date>,
or fifteen days from such notice, and the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period began to run again after <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="6">June
 13, 1981</st1:date>, date of its receipt of notice of the denial of the said
motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
herein petition was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="7">July 2,
 1981</st1:date>, or nineteen days later, there is no question that it is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">tardy by four days</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Counted from June 13, the fifteen-day period prescribed under
Rule 45, assuming it is applicable, would end on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1982</st1:date>, or also <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">four days</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>from
July 2, when the petition was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">If it was filed under B.P. 129, then, considering that the motion
for reconsideration was filed on the fifteenth day after MICO received notice
of the decision, only one more day would have remained for it to appeal, to
wit, <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That would make the petition <u>eighteen days</u>
late by July 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, even if the applicable <span class="GramE">law were</span>
still R.A. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5434, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">governing </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">appeals from administrative bodies, the
petition would still </span>be tardy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The law provides for a fixed period of ten days from notice of the
denial of a seasonable motion for reconsideration within which to appeal from
the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, that ten-day
period, counted from <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1982</st1:date>,
would have ended on <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1982</st1:date>,
making the petition filed on <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="7">July 2,
 1982</st1:date> <u>nine days</u> late.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whichever law is applicable, therefore, the petition can and
should be dismissed for late filing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the merits, it must also fail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">MICO's</span> arguments that there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">no </span>payment of premium and that the
policy had been canceled before the occurrence of the loss are not
acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its contention that the
claim was allowed without proof of loss is also untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner relies heavily on Section 77 of the Insurance Code
providing that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 77.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An insurer is entitled to payment of the
premium as soon as the thing is exposed to the peril insured against.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,
no policy or contract of insurance issued by an insurance company is valid and
binding unless and until the premium thereof has been paid, except in the case
of a life or an industrial life policy whenever the grace period provision
applies."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above provision is not applicable because payment of the
premium was in fact eventually made in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notably, the premium invoice issued to <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span> at the time of the delivery of the policy on <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1981</st1:date> was stamped "Payment
Received" of the amount of P930.60 on "<st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">12-24-81</st1:date>" by Domingo <span class="SpellE">Adora</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This is important because it suggests an understanding between MICO and the
insured that such payment could be made later, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>agent <span class="SpellE">Adora</span> had assured <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
it is not denied that this payment was actually made by <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Adora</span>, who remitted the same to MICO.</p>

<p class="BODY">The payment was made on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">December
 24, 1981</st1:date>, and the fire occurred on <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One wonders:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>suppose the payment
had been made and accepted in, say, August 1981, would the commencement date of
the policy have been changed to the date of the payment, or would the payment
have retroacted to <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1981</st1:date>?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If MICO accepted the payment in December 1981
and the insured property had not been burned, would that policy not have
expired just the same on <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1982</st1:date>,
pursuant to its original terms, and not on <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1982</st1:date>?</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem from <span class="SpellE">MICO's</span> own theory,
that the policy would have become effective only upon payment, if accepted, and
so would have been valid only from December 24, 1981, but only up to July 22,
1982, according to the original terms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the policy would have run for only eight months although
the premium paid was for one whole year.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the premium was actually paid by <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span> to <span class="SpellE">Adora</span> on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1981</st1:date>, who received it
on behalf of MICO, to which it was remitted on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What is questioned is the validity of <span class="SpellE">Pinca's</span>
payment and of <span class="SpellE">Adora's</span> authority to receive it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">MICO's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> acknowledgment of <span class="SpellE">Adora</span>
as its agent defeats its contention that he was not authorized to receive the
premium payment on its behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
clearly provided in Section 306 of the Insurance Code that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 306.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Any insurance company which delivers to an insurance agent or
insurance broker a policy or contract of insurance shall be deemed to have
authorized such agent or broker to receive on its behalf payment of any premium
which is due on such policy or contract of insurance at the time of its
issuance or delivery or which becomes due thereon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And it is a well-known principle under the law of agency that:</p>

<blockquote>"Payment to an agent having authority to receive or collect
payment is equivalent to payment to the principal himself; such payment is
complete when the money delivered is into the agent's hands and is a discharge
of the indebtedness owing to the principal."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is the petitioner's argument, however, that <span class="SpellE">Adora</span> was not authorized to accept the premium payment
because six months had elapsed since the issuance of the insurance policy and
such acceptance was prohibited by the policy itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that this prohibition was
binding upon <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>, who made the payment to <span class="SpellE">Adora</span> at her own risk as she was bound to first check his
authority to receive it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">MICO is taking an inconsistent stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While contending that acceptance of the
premium payment was prohibited by the policy, it at the same time insists that
the policy never came into force because the premium had not been paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One surely cannot have his cake and eat it
too.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not share <span class="SpellE">MICO's</span> view that there
was no existing insurance at the time of the loss sustained by <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span> because her policy never became effective for
non-payment of premium.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Payment was in
fact made, rendering the policy operative as of <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1981</st1:date>, and removing it from the provisions of Article
77.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the policy could be
canceled on any of the supervening grounds enumerated in Article 64 (except
"non-payment of premium") provided the cancellation was made in
accordance therewith and with Article 65.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Section 64 reads as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 64.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No policy of insurance other than life shall
be cancelled by the insurer except upon prior notice thereof to the insured,
and no notice of cancellation shall be effective unless it is based on the
occurrence, after the effective date of the policy, of one or more of the
following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>non-payment of premium;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b<span class="GramE">)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>conviction</span>

follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 65.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All notices of cancellation mentioned in the

request of the named insured, the insurer will furnish the facts on which the
cancellation is based."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A valid cancellation must, therefore, require concurrence of the
following conditions:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There must be prior
notice of cancellation to the insured;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(3)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The notice must be (a)

<p class="BODY">(4)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must state (a)
which of the grounds mentioned in Section 64 is relied upon and (b) that upon
written request of the <span class="GramE">insured,</span> the insurer will
furnish the facts on which the cancellation is based.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">MICO claims it canceled the policy in question on <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1981</st1:date>, for non-payment of
premium.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To support this assertion, it
presented one of its employees, who testified that "the original of the
endorsement and credit memo" - presumably meaning the alleged cancellation
- "were sent the assured by mail through our mailing section."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
However, there is no proof that the notice, assuming it complied with the other
requisites mentioned above, was actually mailed to and received by <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All MICO
offers to show that the cancellation was communicated to the insured is its
employee's testimony that the said cancellation was sent "by mail through
our mailing section," without more.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner then says that its "stand is enervated (sic) by the
legal presumption of regularity and due performance of duty,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
(not realizing perhaps that "enervated" means
"debilitated," not "strengthened").</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there is the flat denial of <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span>, who says she never received the claimed cancellation
and who, of course, did not have to prove such denial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the strict language of Section 64
that no insurance policy shall be canceled except upon prior notice, it
behooved MICO to make sure that the cancellation was actually sent to and
received by the insured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption
cited is unavailing against the positive duty enjoined by Section 64 upon MICO
and the flat denial made by the private respondent that she had received notice
of the claimed cancellation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It stands to reason that if <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span> had
really received the said notice, she would not have made payment on the
original policy on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, she would have asked for a new
insurance, effective on that date and until one year later, and so taken
advantage of the extended period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court finds that if she did pay on that date, it was because she honestly
believed that the policy issued on June 7, 1981, was still in effect and she
was willing to make her payment retroact to July 22, 1981, its stipulated
commencement date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, agent <span class="SpellE">Adora</span> was very accommodating and had earlier told her
"to call him up any time" she was ready with her payment on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">policy earlier issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was obviously only reciprocating in kind
when she paid her premium for the period beginning </span><st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">July 22, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, and not </span><st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">December 24, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">MICO suggests that <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span> knew the policy had already been canceled and that
when she paid the premium on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">December 24, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, her purpose was "to renew it." As
this could not be done by the agent alone under the terms of the original
policy, the renewal thereof did not legally bind MICO, which had not ratified
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To support this argument, MICO cites
the following exchange:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, Madam Witness, on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1981</st1:date>, you made the alleged
payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, my question is that, did
it not come to your mind that after the lapse of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">six </span>(6) months, your policy was cancelled?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have thought of that but the agent told me
to call him up at anytime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So if you thought that your policy was
already intended to revive cancelled policy?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"O:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Misleading, <span class="GramE">Your</span>
Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Heating Officer:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of witness is that, she thought
of that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will revise the question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, Mrs. Witness, you stated that you
thought the policy was cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now,
when you made the payment of <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">December
 24, 1981</st1:date>, your intention was to revive the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">A close study of the above transcript will show that <span class="SpellE">Pinca</span> meant to renew the policy <u>if</u> it had really
been already canceled but not if it was still effective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was all conditional.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it has not been shown that there was a
valid cancellation of the policy, there was consequently no need to renew it
but to pay the premium thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Payment
was thus legally made on the <u>original</u> transaction and it could be, and
was, validly received on behalf of the insurer by its agent <span class="SpellE">Adora</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Adora</span>,
incidentally, had not been informed of the cancellation either and saw no
reason not to accept the said payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last point raised by the petitioner should not pose much
difficulty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The valuation fixed in fire
insurance policy is conclusive in case of total loss in the absence of fraud,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
which is not shown here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Loss and its
amount may be determined on the basis of such proof as may be offered by the
insured, which need not be of such persuasiveness as is required in judicial
proceedings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
If, as in this case, the insured files notice and preliminary proof of loss and
the insurer fails to specify to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">former
all the defects thereof and without unnecessary delay, all objections to notice
and proof of loss are deemed waived under Section 90 of the Insurance Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The certification<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
issued by the Integrated National Police, Lao-<span class="SpellE">ang</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, as to the extent of <span class="SpellE">Pinca's</span>
loss should be considered sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Notably, MICO submitted no evidence to the contrary nor did it even
question the extent of the loss in its answer before the Insurance Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also worth observing that <span class="SpellE">Pinca's</span> property was not the only building burned in the
fire that razed the commercial district of Lao-<span class="SpellE">ang</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, on <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1982</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the Insurance Code that makes the
participation of an adjuster in the assessment of the loss imperative or
indispensable, as MICO suggests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section
325, which it cites, simply speaks of the licensing and duties of adjusters.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see in this case an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">obvious design </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">t</span>o evade<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span>or at least delay the discharge of a just obligation through
efforts bordering on bad faith if not plain duplicity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note that the motion for reconsideration
was filed on the fifteenth day from notice of the decision of the Insurance
Commission and that there was a feeble attempt to show that the notice of denial
of the said motion was not received on June 13, 1982, to further hinder the
proceedings and justify the filing of the petition with this Court fourteen
days after June 18, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We also look
askance at the alleged cancellation, of which the insured and <span class="SpellE">MICO's</span> agent himself had no knowledge, and the curious fact
that although <span class="SpellE">Pinca's</span> payment was remitted to MICO by
its agent on January 15, 1982, MICO sought to return it to <span class="SpellE">Adora</span>
only on February 5, 1982, after it presumably had learned of the occurrence of
the loss insured against on January 18, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These circumstances make the motives of the petitioner highly suspect,
to say the least, and cast serious doubts upon its candor and <u>bona</u> <u>fides</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
