				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue in the instant special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>
is whether or not, by virtue of the principle of election of remedies, an
action filed in California, U.S.A., to recover real property located therein
and to constitute a constructive trust on said property precludes the filing in
our jurisdiction of an action to recover the purchase price of said real
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="27" year="1977">May 27, 1977</st1:date>,
Dolores <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> requested the transfer of $1,000 from
the First National Bank of <st1:place><st1:city>Moundsville</st1:city>, <st1:state>West
  Virginia</st1:state>, <st1:country-region>U. S. A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>
to Victoria Javier in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
through the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Prudential Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the First National Bank
requested the petitioner, Mellon Bank, to effect the transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the wire sent by Mellon Bank
to Manufacturers Hanover Bank, a correspondent of Prudential Bank, indicated
the amount transferred as "US $1,000,000.00" instead of US $1,000.00.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Hence, Manufacturers Hanover Bank
transferred one million dollars less bank charges of $6.30 to the Prudential
Bank for the account of Victoria Javier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="3" year="1977">June 3, 1977</st1:date>,
Javier opened a new dollar account (No. 343) in the Prudential Bank and
deposited $999,943.70.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately
thereafter, Victoria Javier and her husband, <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Javier, Jr., made withdrawals from the
account, deposited them in several banks only to withdraw them later in an
apparent plan to conceal, "launder" and dissipate the erroneously sent
amount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 14, 1977, Javier withdrew $475,000 from account No. 343
and converted it into eight cashier's checks made out to the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) F.C. <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">&amp; Co., </span>Inc., two checks for the
total amount of P1,000,000; (b) <span class="SpellE">Elnor</span> Investment Co.,
Inc., two checks for P1,000,000; (c) Paramount Finance Corporation, two checks
for P1,000,000; and (d) M. Javier, Jr., two checks for P496,000.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">six </span>checks were delivered to Jose Marquez and <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Javier, Jr. had
requested Jose Marquez, a realtor, to look for properties for sale in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Marquez offered a 160-acre lot in the <st1:place>Mojave desert</st1:place>
in <st1:place><st1:placename>California</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
which was owned by <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>,
Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Javier, without having seen the
property, agreed to buy it for P3,236,800 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(US
$437,405) although it was actually appraised at around $38,500.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, as <span class="SpellE">Poblador's</span>
agent, Marquez executed in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Makati</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> a deed of absolute sale in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span> and had the document notarized in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> before an associate of <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marquez executed another deed of sale
indicating receipt of the purchase price and sent the deed to the Kern County
Registrar in </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">California</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> for registration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span> had requested that
the purchase price should not be paid directly to him, the payment of
P3,000,000 was coursed through <span class="SpellE">Elnor</span> Investment Co.,
Inc., allegedly <span class="SpellE">Poblador's</span> personal holding company;
Paramount Finance, allegedly headed by <span class="SpellE">Poblador's</span>
brother, and F. C. <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span>, allegedly a stock
brokerage with extensive dealings with <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The payment was made through the
aforementioned six cashier's checks while the balance of P236,000 was paid in
cash by Javier who did not even ask for a receipt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two checks <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P1,000,000 was
delivered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">by </span><span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>
to F. C. <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span> with specific instructions to
purchase Atlas, SMC and <span class="SpellE">Philex</span> shares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The four checks for P2,000,000 with <span class="SpellE">Elnor</span> Investment and Paramount Finance as payees were
delivered to the latter to purchase "bearer" notes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">July, 1977, </span>Mellon
Bank filed a complaint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">docketed as No.
148056 in the Superior Court of California, County of Kern, against <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Javier, Jane Doe Javier, <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>, Jr., and Does I through V.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its first amended </span>complaint to
impose constructive trust dated July 14, 1977,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Mellon Bank alleged that it had mistakenly and inadvertently caused the
transfer of the sum of $999,000.00 to Jane Doe Javier; that it believes that
the defendants had withdrawn said funds; that "the defendants and each of
them have used a portion of said funds to purchase real property located in
Kern County, California"; and that because of defendants' knowledge of
Mellon Bank's mistake and inadvertence and their use of the funds to purchase
the property, they and "each of them are involuntary or constructive
trustees of the real property and of any profits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
with a duty to convey the same to plaintiff <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">forthwith." It prayed that the defendants and each of them be
declared as holders of the property in trust for the plaintiff; that defendants
be compelled to transfer legal title and possession of the property to the
plaintiff; that defendants be made to pay the costs of the suit, and that other
<span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> be granted them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 29, 1977, Mellon Bank also filed in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch X, a complaint against the
Javier spouses, <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>,
Jr., Domingo L. <span class="SpellE">Jhocson</span>, Jr., Jose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Marquez, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Gariño</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Elnor</span> Investment Co., Inc., F.C. <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span>
&amp; Co., Inc. and Paramount Finance Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After its amendment, Rafael Caballero and
Tri-Arc Investment &amp; Management Company, Inc. were also named defendants.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The amended and supplemental complaint alleged the facts set
forth above and added that Roberto <span class="SpellE">Gariño</span>, chief
accountant of Prudential Bank, and who was the reference of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Ventosa's</span> dollar remittances to Victoria Javier,
immediately informed the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span> of the receipt of US
$1,000,000.00; that knowing the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">
financial circumstances of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> and the fact
that a mistake had been committed, the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>, with
undue haste, took unlawful advantage of the mistake, withdrew the whole amount
and transferred the same to a "343 dollar account"; that, aided and
abetted by <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span> and Domingo L. <span class="SpellE">Jhocson</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>
"compounded and completed the conversion" of the funds by withdrawing
from the account dollars or pesos equivalent to US $975,000; that by force of
law, the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span> had been constituted trustees of an
implied trust for the benefit of Mellon Bank with a clear duty to return to
said bank the moneys mistakenly paid to them; that, upon request of Mellon Bank
and Manufacturers Hanover Bank, Prudential Bank informed the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span> of the erroneous transmittal of one million dollars
first orally and later by letter-demand; that conferences between the
representatives of the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>, led by <span class="SpellE">Jhocson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>, in the
latter's capacity as legal and financial counsel, and representatives of Mellon
Bank, proved futile as the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span> claimed that most
of the moneys had been irretrievably spent; that the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>
could only return the amount if the Mellon Bank should agree to make an
absolute quitclaim and waiver of future rights against them, and that in a
scheme to conceal and dissipate </span>the funds, through the active <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">participation of Jose Marquez, the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span> bought the California </span>property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It further alleged that trust fund moneys <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P3,000,000.00 were made payable to <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span>,
Paramount and <span class="SpellE">Elnor</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span>,
on instructions of <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>, purchased shares of
stock at a stock exchange for P1,000,000.00 but later, it hastily sold said
shares at a loss of approximately P150,000.00 to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">prejudice of the plaintiff; that proceeds of the sale were deposited by
<span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span> in the name of <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>
and/or the law office of <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Azada</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tomacruz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>; that
dividends declared on the shares were delivered by <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span>
to Caballero after the complaint had been filed and thereafter, Caballero
deposited the dividends in his personal account; that after receiving the
P1,000,000.00 trust money, Paramount issued promissory notes upon maturity of
which Paramount released the amount to unknown persons; that </span><span class="SpellE">Elnor</span> also invested <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P1,000,000.00
in Paramount for which the latter also issued promissory notes; that after the
filing of the complaint, counsel for plaintiff requested Paramount not to
release the amount after maturity; that in evident bad faith, <span class="SpellE">Elnor</span> transferred the non-negotiable Paramount promissory
notes to Tri-Arc; that when the notes matured, Paramount delivered the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">proceeds </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of P1,000,000.00 to Tri-Arc; that <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>
knew or should have known that the attorney's fees he received from the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span> came from the trust funds; and that despite formal
demands even after the filing of the complaint, the defendants refused to
return the trust funds which they continued concealing and dissipating.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It prayed that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>, <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>, <span class="SpellE">Elnor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jhocson</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">and <span class="SpellE">Gariño</span> </span>be
ordered to account for and pay jointly and severally unto the plaintiff
US$999,000.00 plus increments, additions, fruits and interests earned by the
funds from receipt thereof until fully paid; (b) the other defendants be
ordered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>account for and pay
unto the plaintiff jointly and severally with the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>
to the extent of the amounts which each of them may have received directly or
indirectly from the US$999,000.00 plus increments, additions, fruits and
interests; (c) Marquez be held jointly and severally liable with <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span> for the amount received by the latter for the sale
of the 160-acre lot in California City; and (d) defendants be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">likewise </span>held liable jointly and
severally for attorney's fees and litigation expenses plus exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the defendants filed their answers and hearing of
the case ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony, Jose
Marquez stated that Prudential Bank and Trust Company checks Nos. 2530 and 2531
in the respective amounts of P100,000 and P900,000 payable to F. C. <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span> were delivered to him by <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
Javier, Jr. as partial consideration for the sale of <span class="SpellE">Poblador's</span>
property in <st1:state><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After receiving the checks, <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span> purchased shares of Atlas Mining, <span class="SpellE">Philex</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span> and San Miguel
Corporation for Account No. 3000, which, according to Fred <span class="SpellE">Hagedorn</span>,
belonged to the law office of <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Judge Acosta explained:</p>

<blockquote>"After a judicious evaluation of the arguments of the parties
the Court is of the view that in cases where money held in trust was diverted
by the trustee, under the ‘rule of trust pursuit' the beneficiary ‘may elect whether
to accept the trust estate in its new form or hold the trustee responsible for
it in its original condition’ (Lathrop vs. Hampton, 31 Cal. 17; <span class="SpellE">Zodos</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Marefalos</span>, 48 Idaho
291; <span class="SpellE">Bahle</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Hasselbrach</span>,
64 NW <span class="SpellE">Eq</span>. 334, 51 Sections 508-76 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 2d p. 475), and that 'an election to pursue one remedy
waives and bars pursuit of any inconsistent remedy' (76 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>
2d S253).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The instant complaint among
others is for the recovery of the purchase price of the Kern property as held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>trust for the plaintiff while in
the <st1:state><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:state> case the plaintiff
maintains that the Kern property is held in trust for the plaintiff, which

</span>Neither can the plaintiff now abandon his complaint for the recovery of

<p class="BODY">Mellon Bank moved for reconsideration, alleging that said order prevented
the presentation of evidence on the purchase price of the California property;

of the original complaint in this case, except for the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>,
no other defendants raised in their answers the affirmative defense of the
filing of the California case; that after the amendment of the complaint, none
of the defendants raised the matter of "election of remedies" in
their answers; that realizing this procedural error, Paramount sought the
amendment of its answer to reflect the "defense" of election of
remedies"; that, disregarding its previous orders allowing evidence and
testimonies on Account No. 2825-1, the court made a turnabout and ruled that
the testimonies on said account were irrelevant and confidential under Republic
Act No. 1405; that Philippine law and jurisprudence does not require the
election of remedies for they favor <span class="SpellE">availment</span> of all
remedies; that even United States jurisprudence frowns upon election of
remedies if it will lead to an inequitable result; that, as held by this Court

there can be no binding election of remedies before the decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>the merits is had; that until Mellon

<p class="BODY">We view respondents' reliance on the procedural principle of
election of remedies <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>part of
their ploy to terminate Civil Case No. 26899 prematurely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the exception of the <span class="SpellE">Javiers</span>,
respondents failed to raise it as a defense in their answers and therefore, by
virtue of Section 2, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, such defense is deemed
waived.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Notwithstanding its lengthy and thorough discussion during the hearing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>in pleadings subsequent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>the answers, the issue of election
of remedies has not, contrary to the lower court's assertion, been elevated to
a "substantive one." Having been waived as a defense, it cannot be
treated as if it has been raised in a motion to dismiss based on the
nonexistence of a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, granting that the defense was properly raised, it is
inapplicable in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its broad
sense, election of remedies refers to the choice by a party to an action of one
of two or more coexisting remedial rights, where several such rights arise out
of the same facts, but the term has been generally limited to a choice by a
party between inconsistent remedial rights, the assertion of one being
necessarily repugnant to, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
repudiation of, the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its
technical and more restricted sense, election of remedies is the adoption of
one of two or more coexisting remedies, with </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">effect of precluding </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">resort
to the others.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a technical rule of procedure, the purpose of the doctrine of
election of remedies is not to prevent recourse to any remedy, but to prevent
double redress for a single wrong.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
It <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is regarded </span>as an application
of the law of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, upon the theory that a party

the law entitles a party to alternative remedies, both founded upon the
identical state of facts, these remedies are not considered inconsistent
remedies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>In such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">case, the invocation of one remedy is not an
election which will bar the other, unless the suit upon the remedy first
invoked shall reach the stage of final adjudication or unless by the invocation
of the remedy </span>first <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sought to be

<p class="BODY">Consonant with these rulings, this Court, through Justice J.B.L.
Reyes, opined that while some American authorities hold that the mere
initiation of proceedings constitutes a binding choice of remedies that
precludes pursuit of alternative courses, the better rule is that no binding
election occurs before a decision on the merits is had or a detriment to the
other party supervenes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
This is because the principle of election of remedies is discordant with the
modern procedural concepts embodied in the Code of Civil Procedure which
permits a party to seek inconsistent remedies in his claim for relief without
being required to elect between them at the pleading stage of the litigation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>
