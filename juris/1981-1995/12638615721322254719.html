<p class="BODY">The only issue <span class="GramE">raised</span> in the case at bar
is whether or not the appellant should be convicted of the crime of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">robbery with homicide instead of the crime of
simple homicide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant contends that the prosecution has failed to
prove that the articles allegedly stolen were in fact in the house of Cesar
Avila and it was the appellant who took them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He states that the finding was based on his extra-judicial statement
which he claims was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">extracted through
the </span>use <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of force and
intimidation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant admits that the confession was taken in the
presence of counsel, a certain Atty. <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Atuel</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
he states that the counsel was not present during the custodial interrogation
which preceded the taking down of his statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also questions the sufficiency of the
lawyer's representation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He states <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in his appeal that the lawyer should have
participated by also asking him questions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged coercion and maltreatment are not sus­tained by the
records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a lawyer present
while the statement was being taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant did not complain to the Fiscal before whom the oath was
administered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the allegations
are in the form of general conclusions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no specific statement as to what constituted the coercion and
maltreatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We
</span>rule that the constitutional requirement on assistance of counsel was
fulfilled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no claim or showing
that the accused asked for a lawyer from the moment he was apprehended or that
he was not informed of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his right to
counsel from the time that the warning or information should have been given to
him or that the alleged earlier questioning was already part of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">con</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appeal is hazy on these points.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What is established was the presence of counsel during the taking
of the confession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attempt to now
discredit him has no merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
lawyer decided against advising the accused <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>admit</u> the
crime, he was only complying with his oath as a lawyer to abide by the truth
and with the expressed desire of the accused to unburden his conscience of the
load it was carrying.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court denounces in the strongest terms possible the
widespread misconception that the presence of a lawyer under the "right to
counsel" provision of the Constitution is intended to stop an accused from
saying anything which might incriminate him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The right to counsel is intended to preclude the slightest coercion as
would lead the accused to admit something false.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer, however, should never prevent an
accused from freely and voluntarily telling the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether it is an extra-judicial statement or
testimony in open court, the purpose is always the ascertainment of truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the judgment of conviction was not made solely on the
basis of the disputed extra-judicial confession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Layuso</span> admits the
killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The physical evidence such as
the ten stab wounds and three lacerated wounds; the bloodied plastic bag and
the testimonies of Cesar Avila and two other disinterested persons, namely
Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Bagang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
Castillo are all consistent with robbery with homicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even if an extra-judicial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">confession is disregarded, the accused may
still be convicted if there is enough evidence aside from the confes­sion
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Nillos</span>, 127 SCRA 207 [1984]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The narration of the appellant as to how he appropriated for
himself the items mentioned as well as the sequence of the struggle could not
have been supplied by any of those interviewed by police investigators and
neither by the police themselves because it is replete with details known only
to the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held in <u>People</u>
<u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Ribadajo</u></span> (142 SCRA 637 [1986]),
confessions replete with details only the appellants could have known are
presumably voluntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the accused-appellant's extrajudicial confession, he admitted
taking the things from Cesar Avila's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

testimony closely interlocks with the appellant's statement on how he took the
missing items.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his court testimony,
the appellant denied taking any­thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This inconsistency cannot be given credence on account <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
testimonies of the two tricycle drivers who saw him bringing a bloodied plastic
bag containing items inside. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1981</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence on record which would show that Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Bagang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> Castillo
were actuated by improper motives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
testimonies should, therefore, be entitled to full faith and credit (People v. <span class="SpellE">Patog</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">144 SCRA 429

the testimony of Cesar Avila and by <span class="SpellE">Layuso</span>
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The credibility of the appellant
suffers when taken against the testimonies of the other witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant merely resorts to denial as to
the robbery and a claim of self-defense as to the killing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that no one saw the accused take the items is of no
consequence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is credible testimony
regard­ing the loss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is established
that there were such articles of value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He ran away and boarded two tricycles carrying a plastic bag with items
inside it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The extra­judicial confession
of the accused discloses that he took the missing items.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's contention of self-defense must fail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His narration of the sequence of events is
clearly illogi­cal and unconvincing primarily on account of its incon­sistency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the accused cited by the
trial judge in eleven (11) pages of his decision (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

that after telling her he was going abroad to work, she got mad, tore his shirt,
and the struggle ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, he likewise claims in his extrajudicial confession that when he was on
his way down, he met the victim who must have suspected that he had stolen
something and that when he went near her to bid her goodbye, she suddenly
stabbed him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that they were sweethearts, the victim's alleged violent
objection to his trip to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Saudi Arabia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was correctly held unbelievable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
the same circums­tances, a sweetheart would normally have welcomed the idea for
the sake of a better future for both of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Granting that the victim objected, the objection could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not have taken such a violent form as to move
the victim to resort to stabbing the appellant to prevent him from
leaving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise unbelievable
that the victim </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">would </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">suddenly stab him when he came near her only
to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">say </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">goodbye.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

wounds on various parts of her body under the circumstances that he alleges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that there is sufficiency in circumstantial evidence when:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) there is more than one circumstance; 2)
the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; 3) the combination
of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable

this case."</blockquote>

commission of the crime, but there was also a very patent display of lack of

inflicted upon her.</p>
