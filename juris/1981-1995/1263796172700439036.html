that Disbarment proceedings be instituted against respondent Atty. Benjamin M. <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Decision deals only with the Disbarment Case against
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>, the Complaint as against

1983, Macro Textile Mills Corporation (MACRO for short) applied for and was
granted credit facilities by the bank secured by real estate mortgages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MACRO having
repeatedly defaulted on its obligations, the bank finally applied for
extrajudicial foreclosure of its mortgages over TCT No. 261842.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sale was conducted, consummated and
registered in the day book of the register of deeds and annotated on the title
itself.</blockquote>

at public auction of the mortgage property described under TCT No. 261842

it and filed a motion to discharge attachment without prejudice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge never acted on said bond or

preliminary injunction, the bank filed a motion to discharge restraining order
and opposition to application for preliminary injunction and attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge never resolved the motion
nor approved the bond.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the filing of
the complaint, the clerk of court collected only the amount of P210.00

millions although its value was not stated and since the amended complaint
increased the claim for damages to P70 million and also sought the annulment of
mortgage over a property now stated to be worth P20 million, the bank filed a
motion on August 15, 1984 to collect the proper filing fees which at least
should have been P139,900.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite
motions to resolve dated August 17, September 3 and <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1984</st1:date>, respondent Judge Jose P.

motion for execution of his summary judgment as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>

accompanied by <span class="SpellE">MACRO's</span> Atty. Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> (respondent here) and several other deputy sheriffs
and men swooped down on the bank's branches and principal office to enforce the
writ of execution dated February 14, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They demanded delivery to them of all available cash money but, it
having been closing hour, the tellers had already brought their cash to the
vaults which were then closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
thereupon took the boxes and coin counters, adding machines, typewriters, etc.

the complaint do not constitute any of the recognized grounds for disbarment
besides the fact that they are the very subject-matter of the appeal taken to
the Court of Appeals in AC-G.R. CV No. 05611 still pending thereat, so that the
complaint is improper and premature; (2) that the charge is purely and plainly
an unfounded grievance of a party which lost its case in the Trial Court
against the lawyer of the party which prevailed in that case and is intended
merely to harass, embarrass and degrade him and to deprive him of his livelihood;
(3) that the collection of the docket fee is an act within the province of the
clerk of court which cannot be imputed to respondent nor serve as a ground for
his disbarment; (4) that the "list of other cases involving other parties
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> show a ‘joint
venture’ between respondents is an empty and a gratuitous conclusion, an
unjust, improper and insupportable accusation, which renders the complaint
insufficient and, consequently dismissible", nine (9) out of the fourteen
(14) cases in the list being cases of other lawyers, and that the proper
parties to make the charge of a "joint venture" being the parties in
the "other cases"; and (5) that in almost thirty (30) years of law
practice, respondent has not once betrayed his oath of office but has observed
"photographic fidelity to the Canons of Legal Ethics".</p>

<blockquote>"Prudential Bank (Complainant Bank) instituted this
administrative case on April 11, 1985, praying this Court to investigate
Respondent Judge Jose P. Castro, presiding over Regional Trial Court, National
Capital Judicial Region, Branch LXXXV, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,

(Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>), in connection with their

Judge and where plaintiff was represented by Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>.</blockquote>

MACRO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the registered owner of a

261842 (the 'MACRO PROPERTY'), alleged to have a value of about P20 million.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What has been prayed for by Complainant Bank is the exercise
by this Court of its power to discipline Respondent Judge, and the initiation
of proceedings for the disbarment or suspension of Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Based on documents submitted to this Court, the relevant
facts upon which this Resolution is based may be stated as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The President and
General Manager of MACRO is named Go <span class="SpellE">Cun</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is also a

were indebted to Complainant Bank in the principal sum of P9,510,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the said date of <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1983</st1:date>, MACRO, through Go <span class="SpellE">Cun</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, executed a mortgage over
the MACRO PROPERTY ("notarized" on <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1983</st1:date>) in favor of Complainant Bank to
guarantee the then, as well as future, obligations of MACRO and/or GALAXY in
favor of the mortgage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More than a year
after, or on April 11, 1984, Complainant Bank sent a letter of demand to
MACRO/GALAXY demanding payment of their pending obligations in the total sum of
P11,629,503.92, exclusive of interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1984</st1:date>, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del Rosario, as a Notary Public for <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, issued a "Notice
of Sale By Notary", scheduled for <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="8">August
 6, 1984</st1:date>, for the extra-judicial foreclosure sale of the MACRO
PROPERTY.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1984</st1:date>, MACRO filed the
complaint in the RTC CASE through Atty. Mario E. <span class="SpellE">Valderama</span>,
alleging principally that Go <span class="SpellE">Cun</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
had no authority to mortgage the MACRO PROPERTY and that his execution of the
mortgage was due to fraudulent manipulations of Complainant Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Complaint further stated that MACRO was
entitled "to actual damages amounting to at least P50,000,000.00 as well
as to compensatory damages".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Preliminary attachment was prayed for on ‘so much of the properties of
defendant Bank and defendant Notary as may be sufficient to satisfy any
judgment that may be rendered against them.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four days
thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1984</st1:date>,
the Complaint was amended over the signature of Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amendments are of no substantial
relevance to this Resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same
prayer for preliminary attachment was reiterated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the same date
of <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1984</st1:date>,
Respondent Judge, stating that the sale had not taken place on that date,
issued an Order temporarily restraining the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City from registering any Deed of Sale of the MACRO
PROPERTY.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge
then resolved the RTC CASE through a summary judgment rendered on <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the Decision, the mortgage of the MACRO PROPERTY
was declared null and void, and Complainant Bank and Notary Public del Rosario
were ordered to pay MACRO more than P33 million in damages plus 20% attorney's
fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, <u>paragraph</u>
<u>2</u> of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the Decision
provided as follows:</blockquote>

Estate Mortgage dated January 26, 1983, as well as its foreclosure, notice of

261842;’</p>

<blockquote>"The foregoing <u>paragraph</u> <u>2</u> is of primary
relevance to this Resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What will
be noted therein is that the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 261842, still in the
possession of Complainant Bank, was not declared cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The continued existences of that owner's
duplicate could prevent the registration of a sale of the MACRO PROPERTY
without it being surrendered to the Register of Deeds as the law requires the
production of the owner's duplicate certificate whenever any voluntary
instrument is presented for registration (Sec. 53, P.D. No. 1529, the Property
Registration Decree).</blockquote>

Complainant Bank, and the issuance of a new owner's duplicate of said TCT to

<blockquote>"Nothing in this Resolution should be construed as a
determination of a factual issue in the controversy between Complainant Bank
and MACRO in the RTC CASE, which is now pending before the Intermediate
Appellate Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Resolution deals only
with the steps taken by Respondent Judge in regards to the RTC CASE when he was
still acting on it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considered in the
light of the facts related above, we find he had committed serious and grave
misfeasance in connection with his actuations in the said RTC CASE in that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) In both original and amended Complaints in the RTC CASE, it was
apparent that MACRO was suing for an amount of at least P50 million.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the very date of August 6, 1984, when the
Amended Complaint was filed, which was only four days after the original
Complaint was instituted, Respondent Judge was already aware, per his Order of
attachment, that MACRO "in its verified complaint and affidavit", was
asking defendants "to pay the sum of P50,000,000.00 as actual and
compensatory damages which plaintiff seeks to recover from defendant in this
case".</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the original and amended Complaints, the prayers did not
ask for damages <u>specifically</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>sum</u> <u>of</u> <u>more</u>
<u>than</u> <u>P50</u> <u>million</u>, clearly in order to avoid payment of
filing fees of more than P100,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
filing fee actually paid was only P210.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ordinarily, a Trial Judge may be excused from immediately
noting a mistake made by the Clerk of Court in assessing filing fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, considering Respondent Judge's
realization of the mistake, on August 6, 1984, the date he issued his Order for
preliminary attachment, and his actuations thereafter in the RTC CASE, his
failure to require payment of the correct amount of filing fees indicated his
partiality towards, not to say confabulation with, MACRO and/or its lawyers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) The summary judgment was ill-conceived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, the Amended Complaint had
charged Complainant Bank with fraud and deceit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the law, good faith is to be presumed, and the fraud and deceit
imputed to Complainant Bank cannot be other than a question of fact, which
should have been resolved after due reception of evidence <u>pro</u> and <u>contra</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing in the Answer, and in its
pleadings in connection with <span class="SpellE">MACRO's</span> Motion for
summary judgment, which could indubitably be deemed an admission, or proof, of
Complainant Bank's alleged fraud and deceit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge's statements to the contrary are bereft of veracity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Worse errors have been committed by Trial Judges but, in the
RTC CASE, the erroneous promulgation of the summary judgment indicates, in the
light of the entire scenario, that the error was deliberate in order to favor
plaintiff, or that it was in actual confabulation with plaintiff and its
lawyers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) The issuance of the summary judgment was bad enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grant therein of damages in the amount of
more than P33 million, plus 20% attorney's fees, when the property involved in
the litigation was alleged in the amended complaint (Annex "F") as
P20 million (sold to FALCONI for P6 million) immediately raises the thought
that Respondent Judge had really taken a stand of partiality in favor of MACRO
and its lawyers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d) The Order of January 7, 1985 of Respondent Judge also shows his
partiality to, or his confabulation with MACRO and the latter's lawyers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The summary judgment was rendered on November 16, 1984, and
notice thereof was served on Complainant Bank on November 26, 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter filed a Motion for Reconsideration
on December 6, 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, as Respondent
Judge has ruled, the Motion for Reconsideration was <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>,
the summary judgment became final on December 11, 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge, therefore, would no longer
have authority to amend his Decision on January 7, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the Motion for Reconsideration was
denied on February 7, 1985, Respondent Judge should also have set aside his
Order of January 7, 1985 amending the summary judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It can now become clear that deferment of
action on Complainant Bank's Motion for Reconsideration was precisely for the
purpose of allowing amendment of the Decision on January 7, 1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Order of January 7, 1985 was set aside in G.R. No.
69907.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is now for us to state herein
that Respondent Judge, in issuing such Order, clearly intended to favor MACRO
by allowing it to sell, as it did sell, the MACRO property to FALCONI on
January 14, 1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e) Respondent Judge, in his Order of March 13, 1985, gave course
to the appeal of Complainant Bank although he had already ruled that the latter
had lost the right of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That Order
of March 13, 1985 was issued after Complainant Bank had instituted G.R. No.
69907 on February 19, 1985, asking that Respondent Judge be ordered to allow
its appeal from the summary judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Order of March 13, 1985 was clearly intended to render G.R. No.
69907 moot and academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Order was
disrespectful of this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If at all,
Respondent Judge should have come to this Court in said G.R. No. 69907, to ask
for leave to allow the appeal of Complainant Bank with admission that he had
realized that his previous denial of the appeal was erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And it may be recalled that, in De Leon vs.
Castro, 104 SCRA 241 (1981), this Court had occasion to state that Respondent
Judge's ‘submission of false certificate of service under Section 5 of the
Judiciary Law is not excusable’.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to paragraph 2 of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the Decision above-quoted, the Disbarment Case was referred to the
Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 4, 1987, this Court received the Solicitor General's
Report recommending:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, for lack of evidence, it is respectfully
recommended that the disbarment case against respondent be dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The recommendation of dismissal was predicated on the principal
findings 1) that complainant failed to prove with preponderant evidence that
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> and Judge Castro had an existing
"unholy alliance or joint venture" in disposing of the Macro Case in
favor of MACRO; 2) that based on the pleadings submitted by complainant
"it cannot be definitely established that any deliberate misrepresentation
was committed much less who, specifically, had perpetrated it" since
"the motion for summary judgment and the amended complaint involved were
filed by two collaborating lawyers, namely, respondent and Atty. Mario <span class="SpellE">Valderrama</span>", who however, has not been charged
"for unknown reasons"; and (3) "on the matter of the non-payment
of the correct amount of filing fees, no evidence was presented by complainant
to prove that respondent was responsible for such omission or for that matter
that he did not encourage and compel his client to pay the right amount".</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court resolves differently, however (Sec. 4, Rule 139).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out in the <u>Per</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Curiam</u></span> Decision of this Court against respondent
Judge, partiality and confabulation are clearly discernible from the actuations
of respondents in the Macro Case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the original Complaint filed on August 2, 1984 by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Valderrama</span> and in the Amended Complaint filed on August 6,
1984 over the signature of Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> in the
Macro Case, the prayers were silent as to the amount of damages being demanded,
clearly in order to avoid payment of filing fees of approximately
P139,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The filing fee actually
paid was only in the amount of P210.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant Bank filed a Motion for the collection of the proper filing
fees but Respondent Judge denied the same only on November 19, 1984 after the
summary judgment had been rendered on November 16, 1984 and despite the three
Motions to Resolve filed by Complainant Bank on August 17, October 26, and
September 3, all in 1984.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for the denial was that the certification of the Clerk of Court as
to the correct amount of the docket fee to be paid by plaintiff was not
submitted and for "lack of merit and for being moot and academic."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> filed the Amended
Complaint on August 6, 1984, and on the same day Respondent Judge issued an
Order of Attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A P10M bond had to
be posted by Complainant Bank to discharge it accompanied by a Motion to
Discharge Attachment, which Respondent Judge, resolved on August 21, 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">The summary judgment was rendered by Respondent Judge on November
16, 1984 despite the allegation of fraud and deceit in the Complaint, thereby
resulting in the avoidance of trial and the presentation of witnesses, and the
Bank was ordered to pay P30M as actual damages, P3M as exemplary damages plus
20% attorney's fees when the property involved in the litigation was alleged in
the Amended Complaint as P20M (and was sold to <span class="SpellE">Falconi</span>
for P6M).</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant Bank filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the
Decision on December 7, 1984 but Respondent Judge did not rule on it and instead
amended that judgment on January 7, 1985 by directing the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City to issue another owner's copy of the transfer
certificate of title in <span class="SpellE">MACRO's</span> favor in lieu of the
owner's copy in the possession of Complainant Bank, which was deemed
cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereby MACRO was placed in a
position to dispose of the mortgaged property, which it sold on January 14,
1985 to <span class="SpellE">Falconi</span> Marketing and Manufacturing, Inc.,
for P6M.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge denied the Motion for Reconsideration only on
February 7, 1985 for being <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant Bank filed a Notice of Appeal on
February 13, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same day,
February 13, 1985, Respondent Judge considered the Summary Judgment final and
ordered the issuance of a Writ of Execution notwithstanding the timely notice
of appeal filed by Complainant Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Execution was implemented two (2) days thereafter, or on February
15, 1985 at 3:55 P.M., with Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
included in the group, which went to the Bank premises to enforce execution,
leaving said place "at past midnight".</p>

<p class="BODY">With the issuance of the Writ of Execution, which also
constituted the denial of the appeal, Respondent Judge had foreclosed
Complainant Bank's right to appeal had it not been for the Decision of this
Court in G.R. No. 69907 promulgated on May 31, 1985 entitled "Prudential
Bank, et al. vs. Hon. Jose P. Castro, Macro Textile Mills Corporation, et
al.," ordering Respondent Judge to give due course to the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents' foregoing actuations reveal an "unholy
alliance" between them and a clear indication of partiality for the party
represented by the other to the detriment of the objective dispensation of
justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Writs of Attachment and
Execution were issued and implemented with lightning speed; the case itself was
railroaded to a swift conclusion through a summary judgment; astronomical sums
were awarded as damages and attorney's fees; and topping it all, the right to
appeal was foreclosed by clever maneuvers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also takes judicial notice of a strikingly similar <u>modus</u>
<u>operandi</u> followed in "<u>Manchester</u> Development Corporation, et
al., vs. Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE"><u>Cityland</u></span>
Development Corporation, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., (G.R. No. 75919,
May 7, 1987; Civil Case No. Q-43867, RTC <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City), where the original complaint was filed by the same Atty. Mario E. <span class="SpellE">Valderrama</span> and was originally pending before Respondent
Judge's <span class="SpellE">Sala</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus - the staggering sum claimed in the Complaint of about P78M but the
clear attempt to limit the filing fees to P410.00 by the simple expedient of
limiting the prayer to such sums of money as "may be duly proved during
the trial"; the fraud alleged in the complaint; the issuance of a writ of
attachment by Respondent Judge the day after the filing of the Complaint after
the approval of a P10M bond issued by Stronghold Insurance Co., a company
blacklisted in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; the immediate
implementation of the attachment the day after its issuance with the
garnishment of the operating funds of <span class="SpellE"><u>Cityland</u></span>;
and the denial by Respondent Judge of the Motion to Strike Out Complaint filed
by <span class="SpellE"><u>Cityland</u></span> for the reasons that the
insufficiency of the filing fee is not a ground for dismissal citing <span class="SpellE">Magaspi</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span> (115 SCRA
193) and that the action was one for specific performance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If respondent Judge was unable to see the
case to completion, and perhaps resolve it in the same manner as he did the
Macro Case, it was only by reason of the re-raffle ordered by this Court of
that case, with 22 others, to all the Regional Trial Court Judges of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, "with the exception of Respondent Judge",
in this Court's Resolution of June 18, 1985 in Adm. Matter No. 85-6-7899-RTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it was Atty. <span class="SpellE">Valderrama</span>, who was
counsel of record in the <u>Manchester</u> case, considering the striking
similarity in the pattern of the cases he and Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
handled, signing either singly or as co-counsel (as in the Amended Complaint,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

</span>In actual fact, a joint venture did exist between Macro and Manchester
known as the Macro-Manchester Realty Corporation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The Court takes further judicial notice of other cases where a
similar <u>modus</u> <u>operandi</u>, particularly in respect of astronomical
sums claimed but minimal docket fees paid, is apparent, with one of the parties
represented by either Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> or Atty. <span class="SpellE">Valderrama</span>, and the common denominator being that the cases
pended before Respondent Judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
summary of those cases was made in a Report, dated October 2, 1985, to the
Acting Court Administrator Arturo Buena submitted by then Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Ernani</span> Cruz <span class="SpellE">Pano</span> in Case No. AM
85-10-8752-RTC as a consequence of a letter-complaint of Atty. Antonio Bautista
in connection with the <u>Manchester</u> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in Civil Case No. Q-35093, RTC, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, entitled "Ocean Park Development Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Kumho</span>
Construction &amp; Engineering, Inc.", which was also pending before
Respondent Judge, with counsel for plaintiff therein being Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>, for "Trespass or Destruction, Illegal Occupation
of Real Property with Damages and Writ of Attachment and Injunction", the
body of the complaint alleged that defendant therein had inflicted damages on
the plaintiff in the total sum of approximately P13M, but the prayer merely
asked for payment of "such sums as may be proved during the trial."
The filing fee paid was P200.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. Q-41177, RTC, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>

Po <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>) for "Sum of Money, Damages with Writ
of Preliminary Attachment" for alleged fraudulent cancellation of an
insurance policy issued by defendant therein, the body of the complaint
mentioned the damages suffered by plaintiff in the amount of around P30M, but
again the prayer asked for the payment of "such amounts as may be proved
during the trial" and the filing fee paid was P200.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original complaint was filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Valderrama</span> while Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
filed the Amended Complaint therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
case was before Respondent Judge's <span class="SpellE">Sala</span>.</p>

City, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Kumho</span> Construction &amp;
Engineering, Inc. vs. Atty. Vicente E. del Rosario" the body of the
complaint claimed damages in the sum of P3M but, true to form, the prayer asked
for "such sums as may be proved during the trial" and the filing fee
paid was P200.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for <span class="SpellE"><u>Kumho</u></span> was Atty. Mario E. <span class="SpellE">Valderrama</span>;
the Court before which the case was pending was that of Respondent Judge, who,
by the way, also rendered a summary judgment therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>modus</u> <u>operandi</u> in the foregoing cases, taken
cognizance of by this Court either judicially or administratively, reveal the
hidden maneuvers of a nefarious network, with respondents as the prime
movers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those cases sufficiently provide
