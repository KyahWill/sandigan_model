A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> of the then Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1977</st1:date>, convicting the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Madayao</span> and Alberto <span class="SpellE">Leban</span>,
of the crime of Murder and Multiple Frustrated Murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The offenses charged in the information took place inside the
National Penitentiary, also known as the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prison, in <span class="SpellE">Muntlnlupa</span>, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused and the victims in this case are
all convicted prisoners, serving final sentences in the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prison.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused were members of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span> </span>Sputnik
gang, who were confined in Brigade Dormitory No. 4-D, while the victims were
Members of a rival gang known as the G.I.G. (Genuine <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span>
Gang), who were quartered in Brigade Dormitory No. 13.</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown in the record, the fatal incident took place at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Six prisoners belonging to the G.I.G. who
were then assigned as kitchen boys, namely, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Querrer</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Domingo Jose <span class="SpellE">Obanil</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Nino and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Catabay</span>, came to Dormitory No. 4-D to deliver breakfast
rations to the inmates in that cell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They parked their truck about three meters from the dormitory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Catabay</span> was
supervising the unloading of the food from the truck, all of a sudden members
of the notorious <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span> Sputnik gang who were
quartered in the said dormitory rushed out with improvised deadly weapons and,
upon command of their leader, <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Dungca</span>, alias "Boy <span class="SpellE">Kamatis</span>
", who shouted "Kill them all", attacked the kitchen boys.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Order was restored only upon the arrival of
prison guards who after quelling the melee immediately brought the injured and
wounded kitchen boys to the prisons hospital <st1:place><st1:placename>NBP</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> for treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the injured prisoners, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span>, died that very
morning, due to "hemorrhage, acute, massive, secondary to multiple stab
wounds, caused by sharp, pointed, single-bladed instrument", as found by
the Medico-Legal Officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Munoz of the
NBI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other injured prisoners,
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Querrer</span>, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
Domingo, Jose <span class="SpellE">Obanil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>
Nino and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Catabay</span>,
sustained stab wounds which, according to Dr. Luz Alma Santos of the NBP
Hospital, could have caused their death if it were not for timely medical
intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the investigation that
followed, the attackers were identified and charged with Murder and Multiple
Frustrated </span>Murder in the information filed by the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">February 3, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

he had escaped from prison on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="4">April
 23, 1976</st1:date>, and to date, has remained at large.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court ordered mandatory
presentation of evidence against Tomas <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> who
pleaded guilty, and ordered trial on the merits with respect to those who

"to suffer the penalty of death; to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span> in the amount of

as exemplary damages, jointly and severally; and to pay their proportionate
shares of the costs".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect
to the charge of Multiple Frustrated Murder, each of the accused was sentenced
"to suffer the penalty of from seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and
one (1) day of reclusion temporal, minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion
temporal, as maximum; to pay moral damages in the amount of P5,000.00; another
P5,000.00 as exemplary damages, jointly and severally; and to pay their
proportionate share of the costs".</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the death penalty imposed, the decision was elevated
to this Court for automatic review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
case was considered submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1981</st1:date>, without appellants' reply brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
died in prison on <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1981</st1:date>
of "massive <span class="SpellE">hemoptysis</span>, secondary to pulmonary
tuberculosis, moderately advanced".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The death was reported to this Court by the then Acting Director of the
Bureau of Prisons Vicente R. <span class="SpellE">Raval</span>, in a letter dated
<st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Required to comment on the letter, the
Solicitor General confirmed the death of the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Roberto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> and recommended dismissal of
the case against him insofar as his criminal liability was concerned, without
prejudice to the determination of his civil liability, to be recovered from his
estate. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In view thereof, the Court, in
its resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">September 28, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, dismissed the case insofar as the criminal
liability of the accused-appellant Roberto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
is concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The lone assignment of
error raised in appellants' brief is that the trial court allegedly
"failed to prove the crimes charged in the information with clear and
convincing evidence beyond reasonable doubt".</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">From the evidence adduced
at the trial, the court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">victims in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the morning of September 24, 1973; that the
attack, planned beforehand, was evidently premeditated; that the action was
concerted and was made so suddenly as to throw the victims off-guard when they
were about to deliver breakfast rations to the inmates of Brigade Dormitory No.
4-D, where the accused were quartered; that the accused were armed with
improvised deadly weapons which they must have prepared secretly for some time
for the purpose of committing the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court found the elements of treachery, evident premeditation
and recidivism sufficiently established by the evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused interposed
self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their version was <span class="SpellE">capsulized</span> by the trial court in its decision, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>From their testimonies, it appeared, as they would want to
establish that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">at </span>about 9:00 to 10:00 in the morning of September 24, 1975, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span>, belonging to the
Gang of Brigade 13, with a container of wine went to brigade 4-D, and as usual,
invited his friend Tomas<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a drink; that when both were loaded of the
wine, <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span>
had an altercation about the change (<span class="SpellE">sukli</span>) of the
former until it became worst and <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span> launched
(sic) on <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> with a knife, but the latter was
able to parry, got hold of the said knife and struck <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Monroy</span> died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the kitchen boys saw this incident they
all rushed to rescue <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span> and there was a free for
all fight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were exchanges of
stones and bottles and all that the accused did was to defend themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Alberto <span class="SpellE">Leban</span>
he was about to come Out from his brigade because he heard a commotion when</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he
was met by stones </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he
retaliated until he happened to pick up a knife from the opposite gang and
struck the same on him although he could not recognize who that prisoner
was."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The trial court did not
give credence to the theory of self-defense put up by the accused, inasmuch as
there was no evidence that the victims were armed during the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was also noted by the court that none of
the accused were injured during the incident, while the victims were the only
ones who sustained fatal or serious </span>injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court found sufficient evidence to
establish that the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">were </span>the
ones who were armed with deadly weapons, including a spear, several pieces of
IDW (ice picks) and darts which were surrendered to the prison guards by <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Dungca</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>an unidentified inmate from
Dormitory No. 4-D; some were recovered near the water tank of the said
building.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A complete review of the record
raises no doubt in our mind that the decision of the court is supported by the
evidence adduced at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case against Roberto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> was
dropped on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1982</st1:date>,
on account of his death, but only with respect to his criminal liability.</p>
