Order, dated March 27, 1980, which dismissed their Election Protest for alleged
failure, within the period given by the Court, to file their separate amended
protests and to pay the filing fees and cash deposits as required by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolu­tion No. 1451, as well as of the Orders of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant thereto, on
February 28, 1980, respondent Court ordered the petitioners-protestants, within
ten days from receipt, to file amended protests separating the contest for
Vice-Mayor from that of the members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>; to pay P1</span><span style="">00.00 </span><span style="">each as filing
fee; and it appearing that a ballot revision was necessary, the protestant for
the position of Vice-Mayor was required to make a cash deposit of P1,000.00,
and the protestants for the positions of members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>, who could remain consolidated in one position,
also to make a cash deposit of </span>P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This

had, therefore, up to </span><st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="3"><span style="">March 14, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> within which to file amended protests, pay
the filing fees, and make the cash deposits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of seven days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(There
is a dispute as to whether this was, in fact, filed on March 19, or on March
21, 1980).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 26, 1980,
petitioners again filed an Urgent Motion for an addi­tional seven days
extension on the ground that their counsel was bed-ridden, which period would
have extend­ed up to April 2, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
last Motion was <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon by respondent Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1,
 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioners
filed an Amended Protest covering the position of Vice-Mayor (Election Case 3),
and another Amended Protest (Election Case 3-A) in respect of the members of
the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corresponding cash deposits in the total

protestants for the position of members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>, who failed to pay the filing fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, apparently
unaware of petitioners' Motion for extension dated </span><st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="3"><span style="">March 26, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent Court dismissed the Election
Protest in its Order of </span><st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="3"><span style="">March 27, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, herein assailed, reasoning as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"The Court believes
that the </span>period within which the <span class="GramE">protestants</span>
may submit amended petitions in order to separate the protest for vice?mayor
from that of the protest involving the membership in the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> may be extended in the exercise of sound
discretion by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, with
respect to the <span style="">period within which the
filing fee of </span><span style="">P100.00 </span><span style="">may be paid and the pe­riod within which the
cash deposit of </span><span style="">P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span><span style="">may
be made may not be extended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so
because the time to file a protest which carries with it the corresponding
payment of the filing <span class="GramE">fee,</span> may not be extended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the cash deposits which may
be re­quired pursuant to Section 7 of the Procedural Rules involving election
contests for elective offices in the municipalities and municipal districts, it
is because it is provi­ded in section 7 that:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the cash deposits herein provided within the prescribed time limit shall result
in the automatic dismissal of the protest or counter-protest, as the case may
be."</p>

<blockquote>"The Court notes that, <span style="">even
</span>if all the petitions for extensions were legally permissible, the <span class="GramE">protestants</span> had failed to comply with the Order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1980</st1:date> within the
extensions sought by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
the fact that the <span class="GramE">protestants</span>, thru counsel, re­ceived
a copy of the said Order on <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="3">March 4,
 1980</st1:date>, the last day of the 10-day-period within which to comply was <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first mo­tion for extension was for 5
days and the last day thereof was on <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="3">March
 19, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second motion
for extension of time was filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="3">March
 21, 1980</st1:date> when the first sought extension of 5 days had already <span style="">ex­</span>pired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>
that the same were extended, still the second extension of 7 days sought by the
protestants had al<span style="">ready expired because
counting 7 days from March 20, 1980 the last day within which the protestants
could have complied with the Order dated February 28, 1980 should have been on
March 26, 1980.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Accordingly, the failure of the protestants to file the amend­ed
petitions referred to in the Order dated February 28, 1980, to pay the filing
fees and the cash deposits mentioned in the said Order 'results in the
automatic dismissal of the protest' as provided under Section 7 of the
Procedural Rules."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners received this

unsuccess­ful in both attempts, as embodied in respondent Court's challenged

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The instant Petition was
filed on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="2"><span style="">February 27, 1981</span></st1:date><span style=""> within the extended period granted by this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="5"><span style="">May 20, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, we resolved to give due course thereto and
con­sidered the case submitted for decision without need for </span>submittal
of memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that respondent
Court committed grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack of jurisdiction
when it dismissed the protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
significant to note that petitioners had promptly filed their original joint
pro­test on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="2"><span style="">February 12, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, or, within the period of ten days after the
proclamation of respondents on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="2"><span style="">February 2, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, pursuant to section 190 of the 1978
Election Code, then the governing proviso.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners had also duly paid the necessary filing fee of P32</span><span style="">.</span><span style="">00
and legal re­search fund fee of P2.00 as shown by receipts issued by the Clerk
of Court of the Court of First Instance of </span><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, Branch V, <span class="SpellE">Gapan</span>,
also pursuant to the require­ments then in force.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in the filing of their original protest, there was full compliance by
petitioners with then prevailing requisites.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That protest contained all the jurisdictional facts and statements of a
cause of action to warrant a hearing of the case on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the filing of the
original Protest, therefore, respondent Court had already acquired jurisdiction
over petitioners' protest, and petitioners-protestants </span><span style="">should not be </span><span style="">deprived of their right to be heard on the merits of their case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After the court has ac­quired jurisdiction of an election
protest by the presentation of the motion of protest within time and proper
notice is given and the bond has been filed, it deprives the protestant of his
right to be heard upon the merits of his cause by dismissing the protest and <i>mandamus</i>
will issue to compel a reins­tatement of the same and a hearing upon the
merits."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that under
Section 7 of Resolution No. 1451, failure to make the cash deposits within the
pres­cribed time limit shall result in the automatic dismissal of the
protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That provision, however, finds
no appli­cation herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners were
not remiss in complying with the rules nor with the Order of respondent <span class="GramE">Court dated</span> </span><st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="2"><span style="">February 28, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is so because they had seasonably filed their motions for extension of time
within which to comply, based on meritorious grounds, the last of which was <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a dispute as to whether the petition for extension of </span><st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="3"><span style="">March
 19, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> was, in
fact, filed on said date or on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="3"><span style="">March 21, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the latter date, the extended period would have already expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as petitioners claim, they had sent by
registered mail the second prayer for extension on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="3"><span style="">March 19, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, which would have been the last day and
would still have been complying, the date of mailing being considered as the
date of filing (Section 1, Rule 13, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of
Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' third and last
Motion for extension dated </span><st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="3"><span style="">March 26, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> was not resolved by respond­ent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was even unaware of said Motion at the
time it dismissed the Protest on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="3"><span style="">March 27, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners filed their compliance on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was within the last extended period
of time requested, or up to </span><st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="4"><span style="">April 2, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, unaware of any denial of the extensions
asked, nor of the Order of dismissal, which they received only on the same
date, or, </span><st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners promptly sought reconsideration thereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There should be no question but that the filing of an election

and that no extensions of said period are legally permissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factual environment in the instant case,
as above explained, however, removes this case from the rigid application of
that mandatory rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the protest
herein been filed after <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="2">February 26,

Resolution No. 1451, that general rule would have been perfectly
applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As matters stand, however,
Resolution No. 1451 was promulgated only subsequent to the filing of the
original protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was presented
well within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period and the requisite
filing fees likewise paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners

equitable.</p>

electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More, "it is a
recognized principle that laws governing election protests must be libe­rally
interpreted to the end that the popular will ex­pressed in the election of
