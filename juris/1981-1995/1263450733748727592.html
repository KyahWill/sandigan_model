				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Administrative charge of grave abuse of authority in that:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainants alleged that respondent judge,
on the basis of the mere cri­minal complaint for Frustrated Murder, issued a
warrant of arrest against all the complainants herein without first conducting
a prelimi­nary investigation on the case; that even when all the complainants
jointly filed a bail bond in the amount of P80,000.00 for their release, the
respondent judge only ordered the release of complainant Manuel Villaseñor,
leaving the defendant Cabes (Diosdado, Francisco &amp; Rodolfo) to languish in
jail for 12 more days before they were finally released." (Page 21,
Record)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Commenting on said charge, respondent judge denied the
allegations of the complaint and alleged that he conducted a preliminary
investigation on the criminal case before he issued the warrant of arrest
against all the accused; and that he did not immediately order the release on
bail of defendant Cabes because the amount of the bail bond filed by the
accused was insufficient to cover all of them and that the defendant Cabes did
not sign the said bail bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of such comment, the Court referred the case to Hon.
Pedro Santiago, Executive Judge, Balanga, Bataan, Branch II, for investigation,
report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Investigator submitted the
following:</p>

DIOSDADO CABE'</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><u>Cabe affirmed the truth thereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On further exam­ination by the undersigned,
Mr. Cabe stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"He feels that Judge Bantugan had not in any way abused his
authority against him and his sons; that he was not forced, coerced or promised
any consideration by anyone, particularly Judge Bantu­gan in making the
(aforequoted) letter; that his two sons Rodolfo and Francisco are aware of his letter
and they were agreeable on this matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>With the withdrawal of the Cabes from the complaint, it
would appear that only Mr. Villaseñor should be heard</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asked by the undersigned just what are his
complaints against Judge Bantugan, Mr. Villaseñor stated that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"FIRST - <u>Though he had put up a bail bond for the four of
them</u>, together with his co-accused Diosdado, Francisco and Rodolfo Cabe in
Criminal Case No. 4534, which is incidentally before the sala of the
undersigned, <u>he was the only one released</u> and not also his three
co-accused Cabes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Given all the records of Criminal Case No. 1587, which is for
Frustrated Murder against Manuel Villaseñor and the three Cabes and asked to
point the particular bail bond which he put up for all the four of them, Mr. Villaseñor
pointed to pages 13 to 15 (inclusive of his bond is up to page 24 which are the
supporting documents).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He firmly
believes, Villaseñor claimed, pointing to the title of his own bail bond
'People of the Philippines, Plaintiff ver­sus Manuel Villaseñor, Diosdado Cabe,
Francisco Cabe, Rodolfo Cabe and Baby Cabe', is the bail bond for all of them</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clearly <u>Villaseñor's belief is a misconception of the
caption all</u> because it bears the names of all the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, <u>this particular bail bond is only
for himself</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that even if the
Cabes have not retracted their complaint against Judge Bantugan that they have
not been released immediately together with Villaseñor, the same would have no
basis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The records of Criminal Case No. 4534 show that Villaseñor
put his personal bail bond on June 11, 1979, which was approved</u> by the
undersigned and the respondent Judge issued an order of release (page 25) upon
presentation of Villaseñor's approved bond; <u>while all his other co-accused
Cabes put up their respective bail bonds only on June 19, 1979, forming</u>
part of the record of said Criminal Case No. 4534, from pages 29 to 43 for
Diosdado Cabe; pages 44 to 58 for the accused Rodolfo Cabe and pages 59 to 73
for the accused Francisco Cabe and upon presenta­tion of their respective bail
bonds also approved by the undersigned, the respondent Judge Bantugan then
issued their order for release (page 75), which he correctly did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the complaint against Judge
Bantugan for not having released the three Cabes at the same time with
complainant Manuel Villaseñor stems from Villaseñor's ignorance of the legal
forms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was misguided by the caption
of his personal bail bond only because all their names are stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But certainly Judge Bantugan could not been
said to have abused his authority in any way when he issued the order of
release of Manuel Villaseñor ahead of the Cabes because Manuel Villaseñor put
up his bail bond on June 11, 19 79 ahead of the Cabes who only did so on June
19,1979 and whose bonds were presented to Judge Bantu­gan much later than
Villaseñor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECOND - That Judge Bantugan investigated Villaseñor in Civil
Case No. 373 on June 15, 1979 without notice, immediately when Judge Bantugan
issued the order of his release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It may
be stated in passing that Mr. Villaseñor was never detained having surrendered
only after his bail bond was approved by the undersigned).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the records of this pertinent Civil
Case No. 373 belies Villa­señor's complaint for such lack of notice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An examination of said records, which is in the handwriting
of the respondent, show that in the hearing conducted by Judge Bantugan on May
23, 1979 (attached xerox copy thereof on page 75 of this record) it was stated
among other things that Villa<span style="">señor </span>appeared
and also Atty. Navarro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notes
further stated that 'by agreement of the parties, let the hearing of this case
be set on June 15, 1979 at 9:00 A.M., SO ORDERED, Dinalupihan, Bataan, May 23,
1979, signed by Judge Bantugan'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
the notes of the lower court for June 15, 1979 (pages 76 to 78 of this records)
stated that among those present is the same Manuel Villaseñor, meaning that he
appeared because of the aforequoted previous agreement on May 23.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"THIRD - That the respondent Judge shouted at Villaseñor that
he would incarcerate Villaseñor for telling a lie during the hearing on June
15, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This, Diosdado Cabe denied
having heard</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection,
the undersigned desires to say that Judge Bantugan has an stentorian voice and
is wont to discuss openly even argue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>And
if Judge Bantugan admitted that he raised his voice against Manuel Villaseñor,
it is evidently to stress his point in overruling Villaseñor who nevertheless
continued speaking</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Under the
circumstance Judge Bantugan was within his right to preserve the dignity of his
court</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This brings another relevant
observation by the undersigned which should also be stated and this is the
'fresh' attitude of Mr. Villaseñor who during this investigation would every
now and then interrupt the proceed­ings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And speaking further of Mr. Villaseñor in relation with
Diosdado Cabe who has dis­engaged himself from the complaint and repu­diated
the same, the undersigned gives more credence to the testimony of the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the unlettered farmer that
he is, Cabe's ignorance somehow brings forth his candidness and humility, while
Villaseñor, the educated, was blindly assertive and 'fresh' in his belief of
what he thought was right which unfortunately was entirely wrong when he
thought that his personal bail bond was also the undertaking for all his
co-accused just because the caption thereof names all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another, when Villaseñor presented his
comment, dated August 22, 1979, (pages 29 to 30 of this record) and Cabe denied
his signature thereon, a cursory examination of Cabe's alleged signature
thereon is markedly different from his admitted signature in his letter, dated
January 3, 1980 (page 27 of this record).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no need to discuss at length the last gripe of Mr.
Villaseñor about the Cabes turning against him after he had helped them with
their bail bonds since the respondent Judge has evidently nothing to do with
the turn of events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear that
the Cabes have taken a stand against Manuel Villaseñor when he withdrew their
bail bonds and had even suspected and complained Rodolfo Cabe for the burning
of his hut.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"PREMISES ABOVE CONSIDERED, the undersigned most respectfully
recommends that the charges against Judge Vivencio A. Bantugan be dismissed for
being without merit.</blockquote>

SANTIAGO</blockquote>

<blockquote>Executive Judge" (pp. 23-26, Rec.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of which indorsement, Deputy Court Administrator, Hon.
Romeo D. Mendoza, with the concurrence of Honorable Justice Lorenzo Relova,
Court Administrator, recommended the dismissal of the charge in his memorandum
of August 5, 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such recommendation notwithstanding, the Court issued the
following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>"Administrative Matter No. 2299-MJ (Rodolfo Cabe, et al. vs.
Judge Vivencio A. Bantugan). - Going over the report of the investigating
judge, Hon. Pedro T. Santiago, Executive Judge, Court of First Instance of
Bataan, Branch II, the Court notes that although it is stated therein that upon
presentation of the bail bonds for the complainants Diosdado and Rodolfo Cabe,
approved by the same executive judge, the respondent Judge Bantugan then issued
the order for their release, it appears elsewhere in the record that the Cabes
presented their bail bonds on June 19, 1979 but were ordered released only on
June 27, 1979 or twelve days later, a delay prejudicial to the interests of
justice, which is unexplained, the Court resolved, before acting on the report
of Judge Santiago, to require respondent Judge Bantugan to explain such delay
within ten (10) days from notice hereof." (Resolution of Sept. 3, 1981, p.
83, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Complying with Our resolution, respondent wrote the follow­ing
letter:</p>

<blockquote>"September 25, 1981</blockquote>

<blockquote>Honorable Enrique M. Fernando</blockquote>

<blockquote>Chief Justice</blockquote>

<blockquote>Supreme Court of the Philippines</blockquote>

<blockquote>Manila</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear Sir:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The undersigned is required to explain as per Com­munication, dated
September 9, 1981 regarding 'Administrative Matter No. 2299-MJ (Rodolfo Cabe,
et al. vs. Judge Vivencio A. Bantugan)' and before your High Office, and by way
of Explanation, most respectfully shows and manifests:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of background, on June 15, 1979 an
Order of Release was issued by the undersigned releasing one (1) of the accused
Mr. Manuel Villaseñor, who had personally filed or presented his required bail
bond before the Court on said date (June 15, 1979).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole truth of the matter was that said
Manuel Villaseñor was never detained insofar as Criminal Case No. 4534 filed
and docketed in the Munici­pal Circuit Court of Dinalupihan-Hermosa is in
issue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, with regards to the other
accused, all surnamed Cabe, undersigned, after examining the contents of their
bail bonds and found out to be very defective, did not issue an order of
release on June 15, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount of
the bail bonds were insufficient to cover the whole amount of the same, no tax
declaration were attached, no written or typewritten names of the accused
(Cabes) appears in the bail bonds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Undersigned advised them and Manuel Villaseñor to change or make another
bail bond and also to increase the said amount of the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 27, 1979 Mr. Manuel Villaseñor appeared
before the Municipal Circuit Court of Dinalupihan-Hermosa and told the
undersigned that he was being late in the filing of the bail bonds of the other
accused (Cabes) for he has no companion during the past days and was afraid to
go to Dinalupihan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, on the same
day (June 27, 1979) inspite of the fact that no copies of tax declaration were
attached to the said bail bonds, the three (3) accused, all surnamed Cabe, had
been released by the undersigned after said Manuel Villaseñor had actually filed
or presented to the Court, said bail bonds which had already the signatures of
the accused, the amount of the bail bonds were already sufficient and another
bondsman was added or included in the said bail bonds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the bail bonds for the
complainants Diosdado, Francisco and Rodolfo, all surnamed Cabe, were approved
by the Executive Judge on June 19, 1979 - the Truth also remains that the said
bail bonds of the said accused (Cabes) were actually filed or presented to the
undersigned ONLY on June 27, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
short, there was no delay whatsoever in the release of the Cabes or 'a delay
prejudicial to the interest of justice' as far as the undersigned is concerned,
for the said bail bonds of the said accused were actually filed or presented to
the undersigned on June 27, 1979.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, undersigned most respectfully
submit this Explanation to your High Office, in compliance with the said
communication, dated September 9, 1981 which was personally received by the undersigned
on September 16, 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Pp. 84-85,
Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing explanation appears to Us as satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to hold respondent
responsible for the delay in the release of the complainants, who, after all,
as can be noted above, informed the Investigator in their letter to him of
January 3, 1980 that they were withdrawing their complaint, prepared by one
Manuel Villaseñor, since they signed it without understanding the same,
inasmuch as it was not read to them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this case is dismissed and respondent is
exonerated, with the reminder that personal liberty is an invaluable right of
all individuals in this country and all members of the judiciary are under the
sacred obligation to see to it that none of their actuations should result in
any undue deprivation thereof beyond the period needed to complete the
necessary proceedings and papers for their release.</p>
