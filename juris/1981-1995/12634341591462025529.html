<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that at about 9:30 o'clock
in the evening of 20 August 1986, M/Sgt. Dominador Pascua, a PC soldier
assigned to the 10th Narcotics <span style="">Regional
</span>Unit (NARCOM), together with S/Sgt. Edgardo Dagoc, a PA soldier, a
civilian poseur-buyer, and <span style="">a </span>driver
<span style="">of </span>the police sakbayan, went to
the Justo Ramonal Village in Cagayan de Oro City on <span style="">a </span>"buy-bust" operation.  The poseur-buyer, a certain Boy Lim, a former boxer, under <span style="">the close </span>watch of the team, met and
conversed with the accused on the street.  Covertly watching them "from the shadows" were M/Sgt. Pascua
who was only four (4) meters away, and S/Sgt. Dagoc who concealed himself
behind a<span style=""> </span>parked truck about five
(5) meters away.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moments later, the accused walked away from Boy Lim and
approached a parked motorized tricycle (locally known as motorela) where Manuel
(Mawe) Laudiana was seated.  After a
short<span style=""> </span>while, the accused
rejoined Boy Lim and handed the <span style="">latter </span><span style="">somethin</span>g<span style=""> </span>in a plastic wrapper.  The NARCOM agents immediately "closed in" on the accused,
identified <span style="">themselves as </span>NARCOM
agents and<span style=""> </span>arrested the
accused.  They brought the accused to
the 10th NARCOM office at the City Hall, Cagayan de Oro, for interrogation.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The stuff given by the accused to Boy Lim turned out to be dried
marijuana flowering tops inside a plastic wrapper, known in police parlance <span style="">as "tea </span>bag".  The marijuana inside the "tea bag"
was wrapped by Pascua in a piece of onion skin paper on which he wrote the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"QUIROBEN POLEZON y ACLA"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONDUCTED BUYâ€“BUST OPN AT RAMONAL VILLAGE CAG DE ORO CITY ON
OR ABT' 202140H AUG 86 TO A CERTAIN QUIROBEN POLEZON Y ACLA ONE (1) TEA BAG OF
MJ W/ ROLLING PAPER AT P10.00 PER TEA BAG."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The suspected marijuana was submitted by the NARCOM commanding
officer to the National Bureau of Investigation, Cagayan de Oro Regional
Office, for laboratory examination.  The
finding of the forensic chemist Bernabe P. Arenga (who testified for the
prosecution) was that the specimen contained in the tea bag weighing 0.8602
gram was positively <span style="">marijuana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented the accused as its lone witness who
testified that at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of <span style="">20 Au</span>gust 1986, while he was watching <span style="">a </span>dart game at <span style="">Tata </span>Ador's
place Pennol Amareli called him from across the street at <span style="">a </span>store some fifteen (15) meters
away.  As he was walking towards Pennol,
<span style="">Boy </span>Lim came near him and
inquired about the <span style="">house </span>of
anyone selling marijuana.  The accused
pointed to the house of Virgilio Adoran, the upper floor of which was occupied
by Manuel "Mawe" Laudiana.  After looking <span style="">at the house </span>some
<span style="">fifteen (15) meters away, Boy Lim
requested the accused to buy marijuana for him (Lim) intimating that Lim was
afraid, and cautious about the </span><span style="">presence
</span><span style="">of several persons near the
house - some of whom were playing darts and others drinking liquor.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused refused the request but was prodded by Boy Lim to do
it.  Knowing Boy Lim to be a boxer,
accused agreed.  He called Manuel
Laudiana who was seated in a parked motorized vehicle but the latter signalled
the former to come.  At first the
accused hesitated to go near Laudiana, but on the second call, he relented and
approached Laudiana who was fifteen (15) meters away.  There, he handed two (2) five-peso bills (given to him earlier <span style="">by Boy </span>Lim) to Laudiana who, <span style="">in </span>turn, handed to him <span style="">a </span>tiny plastic bag or packet
containing the marijuana.  Then accused
gave the stuff to Boy Lim<span style=""> who </span>put
it inside the hip pocket of his short pants.  In a moment, Boy Lim embraced the accused and when the latter asked the
former why he did so, Lim told him "You are a pusher," and bodily
lifted the accused and brought him <span style="">to </span>where
Sgt. Pascua stood watching near a coconut tree some distance away.  Pascua pointed a .38 cal. revolver to his
face, had his hands handcuffed behind him by Benito Lim and then brought to the
NARCOM office where he was interrogated and made to admit being a drug pusher
but he did not sign any written statement.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal accused-appellant assi<span style="">g</span>ns three <span style="">(3) </span>errors

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND
CREDENCE TO THE UNCORROBORATED TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS M/SGT.

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE
ACCUSED DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS <span style="">GUILT </span>BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These alleged errors may be reduced to the lone issue of whether
or not there <span style="">was </span>entrapment or
instigation employed by the NARCOM agents on the accused-appellant.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant alleges that there was instigation, not
entrapment.  We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dividing line between <u>entrapment</u> and <u>instigation</u>
has, at times, been blurred; but it has been clearly delineated by the Court in
several cases.  This again is the
crucial issue in this case.</p>

<blockquote>"In entrapment, the entrapper resorts to ways and means to <span style="">trap and </span>capture a lawbreaker while
executing <span style="">his criminal plan.  </span>On the other hand, in instigation the
instigator practically induces the would-be defendant into committing the
offense, and himself becomes a co-principal <span style="">(<u>People </u></span><u>vs. </u><u><span style="">Nati</span></u><u><span style="">pravat</span></u><span style="">, </span>infra).  Entrapment is no bar to prosecution and conviction while in
instigation, the defendant would have to be acquitted <span style="">(<u>Peop</u></span><u><span style="">le</span></u><u><span style=""> vs. Lapatha</span></u><span style="">, </span>167 SCRA 159)."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out in the brief for accused-appellant, the appellant
was not looking for a marijuana buyer at the time Boy Lim asked him to buy the
stuff; neither was he in possession of marijuana.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant avers that when <span style="">Boy
</span>Lim approached him, he was not in possession of marijuana, but on his
way to see Pennol Amarile who had called him from across the street; and that
he was instigated by Boy Lim to commit the crime charged.  Therefore, according to the appellant, the
criminal intent originated in the mind of the instigator (Boy Lim) and that the
accused was lured into the commission of the offense<span style=""> </span><span style="">charged so that he could
be prosecuted.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellant's contention that the
non-presentation of Boy Lim, the alleged poseur-buyer, weakens the
prosecution's evidence.  Sgt. Pascua was
not privy to the conversation between Lim and the accused.  He was merely watching from a distance and
he only saw the actions of the two.  As
pointed out by the appellant, Sgt. Pascua had no personal knowledge of the
transaction that transpired between Lim and the appellant.  <span style="">Since
appellant insisted that he was forced by Lim to buy the marijuana, it was
essential that Lim should have been presented to rebut accused's testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, we note that no evidence was presented by the
prosecution to support its proposition that the accused was searched or frisked
and that the money allegedly given to him <span style="">or
</span>the marijuana was found in his possession.  In fact, the prosecution admits that the money given the accused
by Boy Lim could not be found in his pockets.  Besides, if it were true that Sgt. Pascua and Sgt. Dagoc were closely
watching the whole event, they could have observed that the accused went over
to Manuel Laudiana who handed the marijuana to the accused.  When the actual arrest was effected, not one
of the two (2) police officers bothered to go after Laudiana.  The prosecution admitted that the accused
got the marijuana from Laudiana, yet, they simply allowed Laudiana to get away
- and with the money allegedly given by Boy Lim thru the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, </span>two (2)
conflicting versions of what really transpired between Boy Lim and the
appellant are presented in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a recent decision of the Court, we held that the person who
could provide the most accurate account of the transaction is the poseur-buyer.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Well-established is the rule that when the inculpatory facts
and circumstances are capable of two (2) or more explanations, one of which is
consistent with the innocense of the accused and the other consistent with his
guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is
not sufficient to support a conviction.  In the present case, accused-appellant's version of the circumstances
leading to <span style="">his </span>apprehension
constitutes a total denial of the prosecution's allegations.  In this regard, this Court has ruled that
when there is such a divergence of accounts -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: 0in;">'it becomes incumbent
upon the prosecuÂ­tion to rebut appellant's allegations by presenting xxx xxx
the alleged poseur-buyer.  This it
failed to do, giving rise to the presumption that evidence <span style="">willfully </span>suppressed would be adverse
if produced.  (Rule 131, Sec. 5[e]).  This failure constitutes a total flaw in the
prosecution's evidence since the so?called informant who was never
presented as a witness and never identified, <u>is the best witness for the
prosecution</u>.  xxx' (emphasis
supplied)<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the circumstances of the case, we hold that the guilt of the
accused-appellant was not proven beyond reasonÂ­able doubt.  The well-settled rule that the conviction of
an accused person must not rest on the weakness of the defense but on the
strength of the evidence presented by the prosecution, has not been satisfied
and met in the present case.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
