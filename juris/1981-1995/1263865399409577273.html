<p class="BODY">Through the prosecution witnesses, on whose testimonies the trial
court based its judgment, the following recital of the factual findings appear
in the court's decision:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence for the prosecution consists of the testimony of
Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span>, widow of the late victim, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> y <span class="SpellE">Manoguid</span>; that of <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span>, a married daughter
of the deceased victim, and that of Dr. Loreto T. Rojas, Municipal Health
Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>
who was admitted as an expert by the defense, besides certain exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pieced together and shorn of <span class="SpellE">unessentials</span>, it is to the effect, that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About 10:00 p.m. on
October 9, 1987, Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> and her husband, the
late <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> y <span class="SpellE">Manoguid</span>, went out of their house in Obo, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>, to stroll as it was a moonlit night and, at
the same time, to buy a gin bottle of kerosene from the store of Romeo Bernal
around 120 meters away from their home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On their way home after buying kerosene and while they were only about
eight (8) meters away from the store, Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span>
heard a sound behind them which she thought was that of an approaching <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
turned to look, she saw her husband whose arm was then on her shoulder already
being stabbed by the three accused from behind.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> recognized the three accused very well as the ones
who stabbed her husband because of the light coming from the store and from the
electric post, besides the fact that it was a moonlit night and she knows them
personally as they are also from Obo, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While </span>her husband was being stabbed, Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> kept on shouting for help but nobody, even among
those in the store, came to help until the accused left the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was because, she learned later, they were
afraid.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the accused
left, the victim, with the help of Romeo Bernal, was brought to the house of
Mrs. Morales where he died on arrival.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For his burial, his family spent One Thousand <span style="">(P1,000.00) </span><span style="">Pesos.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Traversing such findings, appellant <span class="SpellE">Amando</span>
denies having participated in the killing of the victim and claims that on the
date of the incident he was with Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayamora</span> in the
abaca plantation of the latter at <span class="SpellE">Bontahiya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>, San Miguel
clearing the plantation and splitting and stripping abaca.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>, on the one hand, also denies having had a
hand in the murder and claims that he was in their family's abaca plantation at
<span class="SpellE">Maysima</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>, San Miguel, with <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Boseo</span> likewise clearing the plantation and <span class="SpellE">strippihg</span> abaca.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Both Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayamora</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Boseo</span> were presented as witnesses to corroborate
appellants’ claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before us on appeal with the defense contending
in its brief that the trial court erred (1) in not giving credence to the
defense of alibi of accused-appellants; (2) in giving full faith and credence
to the testimony of Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> despite its very
serious inconsistencies; and (3) in finding appellants guilty of murder beyond
reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain appellants’ conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firmly entrenched is the rule that conclusions and findings of
fact of the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not
be disturbed, unless for strong and valid reasons, because the trial court is
in a better position to examine and observe the demeanor of witnesses while
testifying in the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although there are admitted exceptions to this rule, we find no
cogent basis for their application in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to appellant's submission, the
conclusions of the trial court are fully substantiated and supported by the
evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense's allegation that appellants were at some other place
other than the scene of the crime at the time it happened is puerile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"If the distance between the scene of the crime and the
alleged whereabouts of the accused is only two (2) kilometers (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lumantos</span>, 28 SCRA 764), or two and one-half (2 1/2)
kilometers (<span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>,
22 SCRA 1091), or three (3) kilometers (<span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Binsol</span>, L-8346, Jan. 22, 1957), or five (5) kilometers (<span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span>, 100 Phil. 603),
it was held not so far as to preclude the possibility of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> presence at the locus <span class="SpellE">criminis</span>,
even if the only means of travel between the two places is by walking (<span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Aparato</span>, 80 Phil.
199)."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, for alibi to prosper, the evidence must show that the
accused was so far away that he could not have been physically present at the
place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Evidently, appellants were not so situated on that occasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides,<span style=""> </span><span style="">we </span>have consistently held that the
defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the
accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, eyewitness Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span>
positively identified the appellants as the ones who almost simultaneously
attacked her husband on their way home on the moonlit night of <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recognition was made easy also by the
circumstance that the scene where the killing took place was well illuminated
by the lights from the store and the streetlight nearby.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As we have heretofore held under similar considerations,
appellants’ bare denials of their participation in the crime cannot stand in
the face of their identification where, as <span style="">in </span>this case, there is no showing
whatsoever why eyewitness Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti</span> would foist
such a serious liability on the appellants.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the argument that Rosita <span class="SpellE">Panti's</span>
testimony is replete with inconsistencies, suffice it to say that a careful
review of the records reveals that the alleged lapses were merely on some
details thereof, that <span style="">is, </span>regarding the distances of the assailants from the victim and
as to who did strike the first blow, which do not in any way materially impair <span class="SpellE">Panti's</span> credibility or detract from the substance of her
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, such minor
inconsistencies indicate veracity rather than prevarication and only tend to
strengthen her testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the trial court correctly ruled that the crime committed
is murder, qualified by treachery, established by the sudden and unexpected
attack upon the victim by the appellants which rendered the victim unable <span style="">to </span>defend himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Evident premeditation cannot, however, be <span style="">said to </span>be in attendance for want of the evidential requisites to
support the allegation.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
While the other aggravating circumstances of <span style="">abuse </span>of superior strength and nighttime have <span style="">been </span>sufficiently established, the
same are absorbed <span style="">in </span>treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants’ civil liability for the death indemnity due the <span style="">heirs </span>of the victim <span style="">is, however, </span>hereby increased to
P50,000.00 in accordance with the policy adopted by the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
on <st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1990</st1:date> and
conformably with current jurisprudence.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>
