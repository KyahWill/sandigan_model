<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, together with <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Juan y <span class="SpellE">Polas</span>, was charged

<p class="BODY">Juan, who evaded arrest, has not been tried and is still at large. 
<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Only <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> was convicted.</p>
<p class="BODY">The lower court based its finding of guilt on the prosecution's 
evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>
<p class="BODY">In the early morning of July 12, 1982, Integrated National Police 
Sergeants Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Basallo</span> and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> of the San Fernando Police Station in La Union were 
tipped by a civilian informer [identity undisclosed] that certain drug pushers 
would be selling about four kilos of dried <em>marijuana</em> leaves valued at 
P2,800 in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilis</span>, 
Burgos, La Union.<span>&nbsp; </span>Acting on that information and with the 
permission of his station commander, <span class="SpellE">Basallo</span> formed a 
combined Integrated National Police [INP]/Naval Intelligence Bureau [NIB] team 
composed of himself and <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and Douglas <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span> of the 
NIB of <span class="SpellE">Poro</span> Point, La Union.<span>&nbsp; </span>Adopting a 
strategy to entrap the drug dealers, it was agreed that <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> would pose as the buyer, <span class="SpellE">Basallo</span> as the driver and <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> as passengers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Said officers, clad in civilian clothes, and the informer 
proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilis</span>, 
about two kilometers away, on board a borrowed passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was actually their second 
attempt to apprehend the suspected drug dealers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Earlier, on June 
9, acting on the same information, they waited in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gabor</span> for the drug pushers, 
but the intended sale failed to materialize as the latter did not appear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">The combined team arrived in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gabor</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilis</span> at past ten in the morning.<span>&nbsp; </span>After 
parking the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> along the 
<st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> 
Highway</st1:address></st1:street>, the civilian informer left while the rest 
waited by the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="25" hour="14">2:25</st1:time> in the 
afternoon, the civilian informer returned and informed the group that the 
<em>marijuana </em>dealers were in a house situated about two hundred meters 
from where they were waiting.<span>&nbsp; </span>They backed up the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, stopping a few meters from the house 
indicated.<span>&nbsp; </span>Several minutes later, two men came down from the 
mountainside and approached the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They were the accused <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Juan and Michael 
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Juan was holding a plastic 
bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The civilian informer introduced the two to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span>, who was then seated inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, as the buyer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> and Juan boarded the vehicle and sat opposite 
him.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> asked the two the price of 
their <em>marijuana</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> 
promptly replied that it was P<span>600 </span>a kilo and showed one stalk as 
sample.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> inspected the rest of 
the <em>marijuana</em> leaves wrapped in <span class="GramE">manila</span> paper 
inside the plastic bag.<span>&nbsp; </span>He tried to bargain for a lower price but 
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> insisted on the original price of 
P600.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> relented and accepted the 
offer ["<span class="SpellE"><em>Sige</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>ngarud</em></span>"].<span>&nbsp; </span>He took out his wallet from 
his back pocket, but instead of paying, he showed Juan and <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> his police identification card and identified 
himself as a police officer.<span>&nbsp; </span>This caught <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> and Juan by surprise, <span class="GramE">who</span> 
could not make any move.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other members of the team, then 
standing at the side of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, boarded the 
vehicle, arrested the drug peddlers and confiscated from Juan the plastic bag 
containing dried <em>marijuana</em> leaves with flowering tops.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The peace officers then proceeded to the Burgos Police station and 
had the apprehension of <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> and Juan recorded in 
the police blotter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thereafter, they 
brought <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> and Juan and the confiscated 
<em>marijuana</em> to the police station in <st1:city><st1:place>San 
Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union, where they were investigated, 
detained and subsequently released.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p>
<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, a microscopic test and thin layer chrokmatography 
conducted on the confiscated <em>marijuana</em> leaves with flowering tops 
[about 800 grams] at the Philippine Constabulary Crime Laboratory unit in Camp 
<span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span>, La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, where they were delivered by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Basallo</span> for examination, positively confirmed that the same 
were really marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">After a <em>prima facie</em> finding by the provincial fiscal that 
the offense complained of had been committed by the accused, Juan and <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> were ordered re-arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> 
voluntarily surrendered and upon arraignment pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Trial ensued and eventually the judgment 
of conviction under review was promulgated.</p>
<p class="BODY">During the trial, the defense adduced the following evidence:</p>
<p class="BODY">Michael <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, 18 [born on March 19, 
1964], single, and a vocational student taking practical electricity, testified 
that at noontime of July 12, 1982 [Monday] he was sleeping alone in his house 
located along the <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> Highway because he was 
sick with influenza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> At around 
<st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Juan came to his house and asked him to accompany the 
former to meet certain persons.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since he knew Juan since childhood 
and was quite close to him, <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> agreed to 
accompany Juan though he felt weak.<span>&nbsp; </span>They walked in the direction 
of <span class="SpellE">Siping</span>, a road leading to the 
<st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> 
Highway</st1:address></st1:street>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> noticed that Juan was holding something wrapped in 
cellophane.<span>&nbsp; </span>He asked Juan what the object was but the latter did 
not answer him directly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Juan appeared excited and in a hurry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> and Juan stopped at the house 
of <span class="SpellE">Trifon</span> Gallardo where Juan was immediately met by 
Felix <span class="SpellE">Biwang</span>, who was with two men standing in the 
yard.<span>&nbsp; </span>Juan talked with the two strangers, after which they [Juan 
and the two strangers] boarded a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> parked about 
50 meters down the road.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> 
remained where he was until Juan waved at him to join them inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">There were other men inside.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> sat beside Juan who was then holding the cellophane 
bag.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> heard <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> requesting Juan to open the bag. <span>&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> peered inside but he did not know what the contents 
were.<span>&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> inspected the 
contents, he suddenly drew his gun and identified himself and the other men as 
police officers.<span>&nbsp; </span>He placed them under arrest.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Because of shock and fear, <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> remained 
speechless and made no protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">They were then brought to the 
<st1:city><st1:place>Burgos</st1:place></st1:city> municipal building and 
afterwards to <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city> where 
they were detained for twenty-two days.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was only during his 
detention that <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> found out that he was arrested 
for illegal possession of <em>marijuana</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was very angry 
with Juan for getting him involved.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon his release, he went to 
his brother's house at <span class="SpellE">Tabok</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kalinga</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Apayao</span></span>, to avoid Juan.<span>&nbsp; </span>He stayed there 
for about five months.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, upon learning that he was going to 
be arrested because of a case filed against him, he voluntarily surrendered to 
the authorities on <st1:date year="1983" day="4" month="3">March 4, 
1983</st1:date> prior to the service of a warrant of arrest upon him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">In this appeal, <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> contends that 
the trial court erred in discrediting the eyewitness testimony of Felix <span class="SpellE">Biwang</span> and in finding him guilty of the crime charged beyond 
reasonable doubt.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> disavows 
knowledge of the contents of the plastic bag and denies involvement with Juan in 
the sale of <em>marijuana</em>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The issue is credibility.</p>
<p class="BODY">Felix <span class="SpellE">Biwang</span>, a forty-two-year-old 
farmer from <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilis</span>, 
<st1:city><st1:place>Burgos</st1:place></st1:city>, testified that in the 
morning of <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1982</st1:date>, he 
was in the house of <span class="SpellE">Trifon</span> Gallardo, his 
father-in-law, having a drink with neighbor <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Sabado</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Two men, whom he did not know, 
came looking for <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Juan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Juan arrived at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10 
o'clock</st1:time> on board a <span class="SpellE">Marcitas</span> bus.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He conversed with the two men for a few minutes.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Biwang</span> heard them ask Juan "where is it?" <span class="GramE">["<span class="SpellE"><em>Ayanna</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>ngay</em></span>?"].</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Then they separated 
and Juan left the two men in the yard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 p.m.</st1:time>, Juan 
reappeared holding a bag.<span>&nbsp; </span>He <span>was </span>followed by <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Juan rejoined the two men and they 
boarded the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> parked nearby while <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> stayed near the house.<span>&nbsp; </span>After ten 
minutes, <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> joined them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although 
<span class="SpellE">Biwang</span> was about 100 to 120 meters away, he could see 
them because he was standing near the stairs, facing the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He could not, however, hear their 
conversation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then he saw Juan and <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> being handcuffed and the vehicle moving towards the 
municipal building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">When first queried about his relationship with <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Biwang</span> stated that that 
was the first time he had seen <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He however changed his testimony and admitted that <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> and Juan were his neighbors in 
<st1:city><st1:place>Burgos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He volunteered 
to testify in court because he was requested by <span class="SpellE">Madarang's</span> mother to whom he had related what transpired in 
the early afternoon of July 12th, two months after said incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The lower court correctly rejected the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Biwang</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>By and large, it was replete with 
incredulities and vacillations.<span>&nbsp; </span>If at all, it only served to 
emphasize the fact that <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> was with Juan at the 
time of the incident and that they were together inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> when the sale of narcotics was <span class="GramE">effected</span> to a poseur-buyer.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Biwang</span> might have seen what had taken place, but his account 
is insufficient to disprove <span class="SpellE">Madarang's</span> 
complicity.<span>&nbsp; </span>By his own admission, he was too far to hear what was 
being said by the persons inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>His version therefore cannot prevail over that of the police officers who 
were actually present in the vehicle when <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, in 
conspiracy with Juan, negotiated the sale of the <em>marijuana</em> leaves for 
P<span>600 </span>a kilo.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Viloria</span>, who posed as the buyer, and 
<span class="SpellE">Basallo</span> clearly and positively identified <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> as the seller of the <em>marijuana</em>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The latter's defense that he only accompanied Juan and that he was 
completely unaware that the plastic bag actually contained illegal drugs cannot 
overcome the positive and unequivocal statements of the two peace officers that 
it was none other than <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> who personally fixed 
the price of the <em>marijuana</em> leaves at P600 a kilo and who stood firm 
against <span class="SpellE">Viloria's</span> attempts at haggling.</p>
<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the records and find no sufficient 
reason to depart from the trial court's appraisal of the evidence of the 
prosecution and the defense.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are constrained to give credence 
to the narration of the incident by the prosecution witnesses, more so when they 
are law enforcers who are presumed to have regularly performed their duty in the 
absence of convincing proof to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">There was an attempt by <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> to 
discredit the police officers who arrested him.<span>&nbsp; </span>He accused them of 
extorting money from his mother in exchange for dropping the charge against 
him.<span>&nbsp; </span>He added that since his poor mother could only afford a small 
amount, they decided to frame him up.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, he claims that his 
inclusion as a co-conspirator was prompted by "ulterior motives".<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Madarang's</span> mother, who executed an affidavit 
attesting to the <span class="GramE">foregoing</span> was not however, asked, by 
the defense counsel to testify in court to elaborate on the matter and to be 
cross-examined by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
</p>
<p class="BODY">For someone as desperate as <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> who 
was caught red-handed peddling illicit drugs, such an imputation of wrongdoing, 
so easily fabricated, can be expected.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the case of <em>People 
vs. Adriano</em>, 133 SCRA 132, the factual background of which <span>is 
</span>similar to the case at bar, We ruled that:</p>
<blockquote>"<em>It is a clear case of <u>res</u></em> <u><span class="SpellE"><em>ipsa</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>loquitor</em></span></u><em>.&nbsp; His imputation to the police of 
attempted extortion and maltreatment do not weaken the fact that he was caught 
red-handed in possession of contraband.&nbsp; The presumption that the police 
performed their duties regularly was not overthrown</em>."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Moreover, one thing sticks out like a sore thumb throughout this 
case.<span>&nbsp; </span>We refer to the unusually submissive stance displayed by 
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> after the entrapment.<span>&nbsp; </span>As 
correctly observed by the trial court, if <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> 
were indeed innocent of the crime imputed to him as he now vehemently insists, 
why did he not make a vigorous protest at the time he was placed under arrest 
inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, or while <span class="SpellE">enroute</span> to Burgos and up to the time he was brought to the 
police station in San Fernando, La Union, where he was put in jail?<span>&nbsp; 
</span>His lame explanation that he was surprised and shocked by the sudden turn 
of events is wholly unsatisfactory because an unwarranted arrest would naturally 
elicit an indignant protest from an innocent man.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he 
meekly signed, after reading, a waiver, for his safekeeping for seven days 
without inquiring from the authorities why he was being detained.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>And finally when he confronted Juan with the latter's nondisclosure of 
the real contents of the plastic bag, he allegedly felt angry but he kept it to 
himself despite the grave nature of the charge against him.</p>
<p class="BODY">All considered<span class="GramE">,</span> we hold that <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> committed an act in direct violation of Section 4, 
Article II of Republic Act No. 6425 as amended, which provides:</p>
<blockquote class="style1"><span class="GramE">"Section 4.</span> 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Sale</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, Administration, Delivery, <span>Distribution</span> and 
Transportation of Prohi<span>bited Drugs.</span></span> — The <span>penalty 
of</span> life imprisonment to <span>death and a fine ranging from twenty 
thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, unless 
authorized by law, shall sell, administer, deliver, give away to another, 
distribute, dispatch in transit or transport</span> <span>any prohibited drug, 
or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.<span>&nbsp; </span>If</span> 
<span>the victim of the offense is</span> <span>a minor, or should a prohibited 
drug involved in any offense under this Section be the proximate cause of</span> 
<span>the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein provided shall 
be imposed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">That the <em>marijuana</em> leaves may have belonged to Juan is of 
no moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ownership and possession are not indispensable elements 
of the crime under consideration.<span>&nbsp; </span>The mere act of selling or even 
acting as broker in a sale of <em>marijuana</em> and other prohibited drugs 
consummates the crime under Section 4.<span>&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> negotiated the sale without authority of Juan's 
<em>marijuana</em> leaves to <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> who posed as a 
buyer, he took a direct and active part in the crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>His guilt 
has been established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
