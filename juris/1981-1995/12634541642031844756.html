in the <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1980">January 30, 1980</st1:date>
local elections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez was the
official candidate of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party while <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> ran under the banner of the <span class="SpellE">Kilusang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipunan</span> party.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the counting and canvass of votes cast in all the
municipality's voting centers, Rodriguez was credited with 6,626 votes as
against <span class="SpellE">Guiang's</span> 6,491 votes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the 135 vote majority, the

<p class="BODY">On February 6, 1980 respondent <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>
filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> alleging voting irregularities, fraud,

14.0pt">Sec. 198 of the 1978 Election Code."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Rodriguez filed his notice of appeal on <st1:date month="12" day="16" year="1981">December 16, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal bond was paid on <st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1981">December 29, 1981</st1:date> and approved by
the court on <st1:date month="1" day="5" year="1982">January 5, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case having been transmitted to the Commission
on Elections, Rodriguez was notified in a March 5, 1982 letter received by his
counsel on March 18, 1982, that he had 30 days from notice to file his
appellant's brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="4" day="19" year="1982">April 19, 1982</st1:date>,
Rodriguez filed a motion for extension of 30 days within which to file
brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Commission granted him an
extension of 15 days from <st1:date month="4" day="19" year="1982">April 19,
 1982</st1:date> or until <st1:date month="5" day="3" year="1982">May 3, 1982</st1:date>
to file his brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
commission order was received by Rodriguez only on <st1:date month="5" day="5" year="1982">May 5, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date he received the COMELEC order giving him only up
to <st1:date month="5" day="3" year="1982">May 3, 1982</st1:date> or two days
earlier to file brief, Rodriguez moved to reconsider the order and reiterated
his earlier request for a 30-day extension.</p>

<p class="BODY">The COMELEC did not act upon this motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the COMELEC Electoral Contests
Adjudication Office issued a certification that as of <st1:date month="5" day="5" year="1982"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">May 5, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, no appeal brief had been filed while the
COMELEC Cash Division certified that as of </span><st1:date month="5" day="7" year="1982"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">May 7, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, no appeal fee had been paid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1982</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> filed a "Motion <span class="GramE">To</span> Dismiss Appeal and to Affirm and Order That CFI Decision
To Be (sic) Final and <span class="SpellE">Executory</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="18" year="1982">May 18, 1982</st1:date>,
Rodriguez filed the appellant's brief in the required number, furnishing the
adverse party copies thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1982">May 19, 1982</st1:date>, Rodriguez paid the
appeal fee and on <st1:date month="5" day="21" year="1982">May 21, 1982</st1:date>
filed his opposition to the motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss and the opposition thereto were set for
oral argument on <st1:date month="7" day="29" year="1982">July 29, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Memoranda were filed by the petitioner and
the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="17" year="1982">August 17, 1982</st1:date>,
the COMELEC dismissed the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
also resolved the motion for reconsideration for further extension of time to
file brief by simultaneously denying it with the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are constrained to set aside the order which dismissed the
appeal on an exceedingly strict application of a technical rule governÂ­ing
extensions of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 12 of Resolution No. 1456 provides as one of the grounds
for the dismissal of an appeal the failure of the appellant to file copies of
his brief within the time provided by COMELEC rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That this is not a hard and fast rule
admitting of no exceptions is evidenced by the Commission on Elections giving
the petitioner an extension of time to file his brief in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner asked for an extension of 30 days to file his
brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Commission gave him 15
days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue, therefore, is not a
failure to file brief within the original period provided by the rules but the
failure to file brief within an extension of time, cut in half by the
Commission from that prayed for by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, an extension could very well
be for ten days, fifteen days as that granted in this case, twenty days, thirty
days or perhaps even longer depending on the facts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">and circumstances of each particular case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing in the records of this
petition why the extension of time to file brief should be 15 days and only 15
days and why it may not be 30 days as prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Elections is authorized by Section 192 of
Presidential Decree No. 1296 to prescribe rules to govern the procedures and
other matters relating to election contests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Election Code calls for rules that would provide a simple and
inexpensive procedure for the expeditious disposition of election contests.</p>

<p class="BODY">We support the concern of the Commission on Elections that
election controversies be speedily settled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was the thrust in the many cases under the 1935 Constitution where
this Court interpreted liberally COMELEC powers to give it broad discretion
which in the initial "statistically improbable" case, it felt it did
not possess, so that unduly long election contests would not frustrate the
expression of the people's will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">16 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class="BODY">However, this concern for the expeditious disposition of election
controversies does not free the COMELEC from compliance with established
principles of fairness and justice and the adÂ­judication of cases not on
technicality but on their substantive merits, principles which this Court has
consistently observed and which all appellate tribunals are required to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Section 15, Rule 46 of
the Rules of Court governing procedure in the Court of Appeals provides that
"(e<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">xtension</span></span> of time

allowed, </span>except for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">good and
sufficient cause, and only if the motion for extension </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">filed before the expiration of the time
sought to be extended." <span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Rago</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> (G.R. No.</span></span></span> L-7016, May
30, 1955) where the petitioners vigorously objected to an extension of 45 days
to file brief as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of a Court of Appeals rule
allowing only one extension of not more than 30 days to do so, we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Under Section 16, Rule 48, extensions of time for the filing
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">briefs are not generally allowed, </span><u>except
for good and sufficient cause.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
rule applies both to the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This rule provides that extensions of time
for the filing of briefs may be given for good and sufficient cause, which
indicates that the court may grant as many extensions as may be asked if good
reasons are shown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the Court of
Appeals adopted as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a matter of policy
that only one exte</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">n</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sion of not more than thirty days would be
allowed for the filing of <span class="GramE">briefs, that</span> cannot be considered
as mandatory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It being merely directory,
its application can be liberalized </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">when
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">cirÂ­cumstances so warrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it appears that the Court of Appeals has
not made an improper use of its discretion, we hold that the errors assigned
are not well taken."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same thing is true in the payment of appeal fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A justifiable delay may be condoned where the
records of the case show that the merits of the election appeal should be
considered and passed upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Lopez
v. Court of Appeals</u> (75 SCRA 401) where the motion for extension of time
was filed after the last day to pay docket fee had passed, we ruled that
"the payment of appeal docket fee is not a requireÂ­ment for the protection
of the prevailing party and non-compliance therewith within the time prescribed
causes no substantial prejudice to anyone." And only recently, in <u>De
Guzman v. Cuevas</u> (G.R. No. 28717, June 29, 1982) we reÂ­iterated the same
exception to the rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the
petitioner has explained why he filed the appeal fees the day following the
filing of the brief within the prayed for extenÂ­sion of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner asked that rules on appeal be
relaxed "in order that this case may be decided on the merits as to serve
public interest, rather than terminate this case on proÂ­cedural technicalities
without knowing, who of the two, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant
or the protestant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, is the real choice of the
<span class="SpellE">Bugallon</span> electorate." Petitioner cites <span class="SpellE"><u>Juliano</u></span><u> v. Court of Appeals</u> (20 SCRA 808):</p>

<blockquote>"Well settled is the doctrine that election contests involve
public interest, and technicalities and procedural barriers should not be
allowed to stand if they constitute an obstacle to the determination of the
true will of the electorate in the choice of their elective officials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And also settled is the rule that laws
governing election contests must be liberally construed to the end that the
will of the people in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by
mere technical objections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Gardiner v. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, 26 Phil. 521; <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> v. Miranda, 35 Phil. 269; <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>

respondent Court denied 'for lack of sufficient merit and not having taken
advantage of the last chance' an urgent motion for a third and last extension
of time (30 days) to submit printed brief for defendant-appellant and ordered
the dismissal of the appeal, notwithstanding the plea of (a) advanced age (67

three hours because of circuitous and muddy roads due to their being under
construction in addition to the pressure of other professional work, and (c)
the filing of the brief well within the third and last extension timely sought
by appellant, this Court held that the appellate court acted with grave abuse
of discretion in denying petitioners' reasonable request based upon good and
sufficient cause, citing former Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal's</span>
admonition in <u>Limon vs. <span class="SpellE">Candido</span></u>, L-22418,

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.   Jose Rodriguez
had thirty days from March 18, 1982 or up to <u>April 17</u> within which to
file his appellant's brief.   On <u>April
19</u>, when he asked for a 30-day extension, the period for filing his brief had
already expired.   It could no longer be
extended.   As his brief was filed on <u>May
18, 1982</u>, it was filed late.   The
Comelec did not err in dismissing his appeal.</p>
