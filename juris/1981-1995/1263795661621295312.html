<p>Judge Esther N. Bans, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 72, 
Olongapo City, was extended an invitation by the International Law Association 
[Philippine Branch] to attend the 62<sup>nd</sup> Conference of the International Law 
Association [ILA] in Seoul, South Korea on August 24 to 29, 1986, and to 
participate in the Biennial Conference of the International Bar Association 
[IBA] in New York, U.S.A., scheduled for September 14 to 19, 1986. In a letter 
dated August 4, 1986, she requested the Court's permission to travel abroad on 
official time for the period beginning August 24 to September 19, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [1]</sup> </p>
<p>In view of her caseload of 396 cases, 175 of which were reportedly criminal 
cases with detention prisoners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the 
Court <em>en banc</em> instructed the Court Administrator, Hon. Leo D. 
Medialdea, to confer with Judge Esther N. Bans. On August 22, 1986, she came to 
the Office of the Court Administrator [OCA] and was advised to expedite the 
trial of cases with detention prisoners and to submit a report thereon before 
her departure for abroad. She was likewise asked which of the two <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> conferences she preferred to attend, and 
she chose the conference in New York. The Court Administrator then recommended 
to the Court <em>en banc </em>in a memorandum dated August 25, 1986 that Judge 
Esther N. Bans be allowed to travel only for a period of 19 days or from 
September 1-19, 1986, at no government expense, the period of her actual 
attendance in the IBA Conference in New York, U.S.A., to be on official time, 
but the rest of her travel period to be charged against her forfeitable 
leave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, no report on the disposition of the 175 criminal cases with 
detention prisoners was submitted to the Court by Judge Bans. The directive was 
reiterated on August 28, 1986 by the Court <em>en banc</em>, directing the Court 
Administrator to require Judge Bans to submit said report. </p>
<p>On September 1, 1986, the Office of the Court Administrator wired Judge Bans 
to come immediately to the Supreme Court in connection with her application for 
travel abroad. There was no reply and the Judge never came. Neither did Judge 
Bans submit the required report.</p>
<p>In a telegram received on September 9, 1986, Executive Judge Nicias O. 
Mendoza, Regional Trial Court, Olongapo City, informed the Office of the Court 
Administrator, in compliance with its directive, that Judge Bans last reported 
at his office in the afternoon of August 22, 1986.</p>
<p>The Court Administrator was later informed by the Chief Justice, Hon. Claudio 
Teehankee, that Associate Justice Florentino Feliciano saw Judge Esther N. Bans 
at Seoul, South Korea and that she was on her way to the United States of 
America. On the other hand, Atty. Adelaida Cabe- Baumann, Chief Administrative 
Services, Supreme Court, informed the Court, thru her certification, that the 
leave application of Judge Esther N. Bans from August 26 to September 24, 1986 
was not signed and/or approved by the Court Administrator, inasmuch as action 
thereon was dependent upon the approval of her request to travel abroad.</p>
<p>From all indications, Judge Esther N. Bans left the country to attend the two 
<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> international conferences without 
prior approval of her request to travel abroad.</p>
<p>On October 16, 1986, the Court <em>en banc</em> issued a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [4]</sup> requiring Judge Esther N. Bans to explain 
within ten <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> days from notice why 
disciplinary action should not be taken against her for leaving the country to 
attend the aforesaid international conferences without prior permission of the 
Court.</p>
<p>In her explanation and/or comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
Judge Bans attributed her having left the country to attend the ILA Conference 
in Seoul, South Korea and IBA Conference in New York, U.S.A. without prior 
approval of the Court of her request to travel abroad to "the more pressing need 
to prevent unnecessary forfeiture of so much hard- earned money [$550] out of 
the total expenditure of $1,290.00 for both conferences". She said that upon 
being advised by the Court Administrator that she will only be credited official 
time for the IBA Conference in New York, she requested her travel agency for 
travel adjustments but was informed that it could not work out feasible 
arrangements or adjustments in her plane tickets nor cancel the hotel 
reservation already paid proportionately with other lady delegates, so that 
under the circumstances, she had to push through with the original timetable, 
taking the necessary risks and the better option of exercising frugality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p>We are not satisfied with the reason proferred by Judge Esther N. Bans in 
totally disregarding the directive of the Court. As a judicial officer 
delicately tasked with the administration of justice, the higher interests of 
public service should, at all times, be above all other considerations. 
Admittedly, Judge Bans made travel arrangements even before approval by the 
Court of her request to travel abroad on official time. In fact, she paid in 
advance the airplane tickets and hotel accommodations. Judges should be reminded 
that requests for permission to travel abroad on official time should not be 
presumed granted by the Court. Guided by considerations of higher interests of 
the service, the Court painstakingly looks into every request on a case-to-case 
basis. Judge Bans should have informed the Court before her departure for abroad 
of the circumstances which compelled her to push through with her original 
timetable. But she chose to leave first, and explain later.</p>
<p>The Court does not approve of such practice.</p>
<p>Moreover, Judge Bans was remiss in not complying, at the earliest opportunity 
with the directive of the Court requiring her to submit a report on the 
disposition of the 175 criminal cases with detention prisoners pending before 
her sala. In her report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated October 
22, 1986, apparently submitted to the Court upon her return from abroad, Judge 
Bans informed the Court Administrator that the number of criminal cases with 
detention prisoners was erroneously reported to be about 175 when actually upon 
verification of the records, there were only 89 criminal cases with 57 detention 
prisoners, mostly involved in drug cases for which no bail had been recommended 
by the prosecution. Had she been mindful of the directive of the Court, We could 
have at least been apprised of such fact and could have acted more favorably on 
her request. In this connection, it is well to remind Judge Bans of the exigent 
need for promptness and efficiency in the discharge of official duties by 
occupants of the bench. For this purpose, they should make a regular periodic 
inventory of their cases to enable them to know their status. They must ever be 
fully cognizant of the state of their dockets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p><strong>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</strong>, Judge Esther N. Bans, Presiding 
Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 72, Olongapo City, is hereby REPRIMANDED 
with a warning that a repetition of similar action will be dealt with more 
severely by this Court. Let a copy of this resolution be attached to the 
concerned Judge's personal records.</p>
