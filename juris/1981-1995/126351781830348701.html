				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an automatic review of a decision of the defunct Circuit Criminal Court, 7th Judicial District, at Pasig, Rizal with the following dispositive portion: <blockquote> <p>"SA GAYONG DAHILAN ay napatunayan ng hukuman na si LOPE TABIAN Y PANTI ay NAGKASALA, ng walang pag-aalinlangan, sa salang Sadyang Pagpatay ayon sa sakdal, alinsunod sa Artikulo 248 ng Iniwastong Kodigo Penal, at siya ay hinahatulan ng kaparusahang KAMATAYAN; at pagbabayaran niya ang mga naiwan ng nasawi ng halagang Labindalawang Libong (P12,000.00) Piso; at pagbabayaran din niya ang mga nagugol sa usaping ito."</p></blockquote> <p>The information which was filed in CCC-VII-151-Q.C. reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The undersigned Assistant City Fiscal accuses BONIFACIO PANGANIBAN @ "BENNY" @ "BEN" and LOPE TABIAN y PANTI @ "ARMANDO" of the crime of Murder, committed as follows:</p> <p>"That on or about the 26th day of March, 1969, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, without any justifiable cause, qualified by treachery and evident premeditation, conspiring with, confederating together and mutually helping one another, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and employ personal violence upon one ROLANDO MONFORTE y MORCOSO by then and there stabbing him on the different parts of his body with a sharp, pointed bladed weapon while the latter was asleep, thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his untimely death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the said ROLANDO MONFORTE in such amount as may be awarded to them under the provisions of the Civil Code."</p></blockquote> <p>The authorities were unable to arrest Bonifacio Panganiban so only Lope Tabian was brought to trial.</p> <p>The version of the prosecution as stated in the People's brief is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"About 2:30 a.m. of March 26, 1969, Pablo Mendoza, then driving a Deltan taxi (No. 9678), picked up Bonifacio Panganiban and Fidel Atienza at the corner of Rotonda Lealtad and Matimyas Streets. The taxi after moving 20 meters stopped in front of the Matimyas Bakery where Lope Tabian boarded it (pp. 17, 18, 24, t.s.n., June 19, 1969). The three passengers instructed Mendoza to proceed to España Extension (now E. Rodriguez Sr., St.) (p. 18, <em>id</em>). Upon reaching the place in front of the Ysmael Steel Compound, the passengers told the driver to make a "U-turn" and thereafter was asked to stop in front of the Esso gas station, near the corner of E. Rodriguez St. and Araneta Avenue (pp. 18, 19, <em>id</em>). Lope Tabian first alighted, instructing the taxi driver to wait (pp. 19, 20, <em>id</em>). The taxi moved about 30 yards ahead and parked past the Ablaza Building in a dark part of España Extension (p. 20, <em>id</em>). Panganiban also alighted and left Atienza inside the vehicle (<em>id</em>).</p> <p>"Panganiban joined Tabian at the Esso gas station. Both crossed España Extension towards the Shell gas station which is just opposite the Esso gas station (pp. 25, 32, 33, <em>id</em>). At the Shell gas station, Panganiban bought cigarettes at the canteen while Tabian went to a parked Fiat jeep and observed the surroundings (pp. 27, 33, 38, <em>id</em>). Sleeping inside the Fiat jeep was the victim, Rolando Monforte, (<em>id</em>). Tabian went inside the Fiat jeep; moments later he alighted and fled towards the Deltan taxi parked near the Ablaza Building (pp. 27-28, 40, <em>id</em>). He was seen carrying an icepick by Irog Mercado, a 14-year old taxi washer, from across the Esso gas station (pp. 25, 28, 39, 40, <em>id</em>). Panganiban who was standing in front of the canteen at the Shell gas station about 10 meters from the Fiat jeep, followed Tabian running towards the taxi (pp. 28, 29, <em>id</em>). The taxi then immediately sped away. Panganiban and Tabian alighted at Calabas Road, near the Balic-Balic Church, while Fidel Atienza proceeded to Las Piñas, Rizal (p. 22, <em>id</em>).</p> <p>"In the meantime, the victim, Rolando Monforte, managed to get out of the jeep and shouted, "sinaksak ako, sinaksak ako" (pp. 30, 31, <em>id</em>). Blood oozed from his chest and he was rushed to a hospital where he died (pp. 31, 38, <em>id</em>; Exh. "D", p. 54, rec.).</p> <p>"The victim's body was examined by Dr. Ernesto B. Jimenez, NBI Medico-Legal Officer, and his examination is reflected in Necropsy Report No. N-69-399, stating that the victim suffered the following injuries:</p> <p>"Pallor of lips and nailbeds. Stab wounds:</p> <p>(1) Chest, anterior aspect, left side, 4.5 cms. to the left anterior median line, at the level of the 3rd intercostal space, spindle in shape, 1.5 cm. in length, long axis oriented horizontally, medial extremity contused, lateral extremity sharp, edges clean-cut, gaping, directed backward, medially and slightly downward, involving skin and subcutaneous tissues, incising thru 3rd intercostal space, left side, perforating along its tract lung, upper lobe, heart, right ventricle, with an approximate depth of 11.0 cms.</p> <p>(2) Chest, anterior aspect, right side, 1.3 cms. to the right of anterior. Median line, at the level of 5th intercostal space, spindle in shape, 1.5 cms. in length, long axis oriented upward and laterally to the right, upper extremity contused, lower extremity sharp, edges clean-cut, and gaping, directed backward, downward and laterally to the right, involving along its tract, skin and subcutaneous tissues, sternum, lower 3rd at the level of the 5th intercostal space, pericardial sac, respiratory diaphragm, middle part, liver, middle lobe, with an approximate depth of 12.0 cms.</p> <blockquote> <p>Hemothorax, left side, 800 cc.<br>Hemopericardium - 300 cc.<br>Hemoperitoneoum - 250 cc.<br>Brain, pale.<br>Heart, firm, almost empty, with small amount of fluid blood.<br>Lungs; left lung collapse, right lung pale.<br>Liver and other visceral organs, pale.<br>Stomach, empty.</p></blockquote> <p>CAUSE OF DEATH:- Stab wounds of the chest, anterior aspect" (pp. 2-6, Exh. "A", p. 49, rec.).</p> <p>The doctor further testified that the victim suffered two stab wounds; one at the left upper part of the chest, most fatal because it involved the heart (pp. 4-5, t.s.n., <em>id</em>; Exh. "B-2-A", p. 50, rec.) and the other at the right lower part of the chest, anterior aspect which involved the liver (pp. 4-5; Exh. "B-2-B", p. 50, rec.). External characteristics showed that both stab wounds were inflicted by a 'single-bladed stabbing instrument' (p. 5, <em>id</em>).</p> <p>"On the very day of the incident, March 26, 1969, Detective Cesar Dalanon, Quezon City Police Department, repaired to the crime scene and interviewed the washboy, Irog Mercado, who gave the plate number of the taxi used by the perpetrators some hours back (pp. 12, 13, <em>id</em>). Detective Dalanon located the taxi driver, Pablo Mendoza, who in turn accompanied him to Matimyas Street, particularly at Matimyas Bakery, where he (Mendoza) pointed to Lope Tabian as one of the passengers (p. 12, <em>id</em>). Mendoza also turned over to the police authorities an icepick which he recovered from the taxi after Lope Tabian and his companions had alighted (pp. 13, 14, <em>id</em>; Exh. "F").</p> <p>"Lope Tabian was brought to the police station where he gave his statement (Exh. "C", p. 58, rec.) voluntarily to Detective Dalanon (pp. 10, 11, t.s.n., <em>id</em>). Irog Mercado and Pablo Mendoza also gave their respective statements (pp. 12, 13, t.s.n., <em>id</em>; Exhs. "D" and "E", respectively, pp. 54, 55, rec.).</p></blockquote> <p>Appellant Tabian was represented by Atty. Ramon C. Aquino, now a distinguished member of this Court who made the following assignment of errors:</p> <blockquote> <p>"I. The trial court erred in giving credence to the testimony of Irog T. Mercado that appellant Lope Tabian stabbed twice the victim, Rolando Monforte, with an ice pick.</p> <p>II. The trial court erred in disregarding the finding of the Quezon City detectives and the testimonies of Fidel Atienza and appellant Tabian that the killer was Bonifacio Panganiban.</p> <p>III. The trial court erred in not holding that appellant Tabian was only an accomplice.</p> <p>IV. The trial court erred in its appreciation of the attending circumstances, in not appreciating the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction and the circumstance analogous to plea of guilty in favor of appellant Tabian and in sentencing him to death."</p></blockquote> <p>The third assignment of error admits appellant's participation in the crime but downgrades it to that of a mere accomplice. The fundamental question, therefore, is whether appellant should be convicted as a principal or as an accomplice only.</p> <p>We hold that appellant is guilty as a principal.</p> <p>The claim of the appellant is that it was Panganiban who had a motive to kill Rolando Monforte; that it was Panganiban who struck fatal blows on the victim; and that he accompanied Panganiban as an "alalay" to help "if somebody will arrive." Thus appellants brief says:</p> <blockquote> <p>"A grave miscarriage of justice was perpetrated by the trial court when it convicted of murder Lope Tabian (his correct surname is <em>Fabian</em> as may be seen from his signature on his statement, Exh. C, p. 53, Record). The prosecution did not prove any motive ("<em>atraso</em>") that would impel Fabian or Tabian to murder Rolando Monforte. At the time of the alleged killing, Tabian was not acquainted with the victim and harbored no grudge against him.</p> <p>"The sole witness against Tabian was a fourteen-year old boy 'wash boy' who was not present at the killing because he was at the Esso gas station, while, the killing occurred inside a jeep in the <em>Shell</em> gas station <em>across España Extension</em> (now E. Rodriguez Street) at the corner of G. Araneta Boulevard, Quezon City.</p> <p>"On the other hands, the actual killer, Bonifacio Panganiban, who is at large, was mauled three days before the killing by Rolando Monforte, the victim. It was Panganiban who had the motive ("atraso") for killing Monforte. The prosecution's evidence clearly pointed to him as the killer. Yet, the trial judge fastened the crime on Tabian who was a mere "alalay" or lookout, when the killing was perpetrated, and who, therefore, was at most an accomplice but, certainly, not a co-principal, much less the actual perpetrator of the murder.</p> <p>"Hence, the lower court's judgment must be modified. Tabian should be convicted as a mere <em>accomplice</em>." (pp. 1-2.)</p></blockquote> <p>It is true that appellant had no personal motive to kill Rolando Monforte because it was Panganiban who was mauled by Rolando. But we cannot believe his claim that he was not armed with a weapon during the incident and that he did not stab Monforte.</p> <p>It is to be noted that appellant admitted during the trial that three days prior to the incident he agreed to help Panganiban avenge the mauling administered to the latter. And pursuant to the agreement he went with Panganiban to look for the latter's assailant at the ungodly hour of 2:30 in the morning. That appellant was armed with an icepick and what he did on that occasion was described by Irog Mercado who had no reason to give false testimony. Thus, Mercado testified on direct examination as follows:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2"><em>"DIRECT EXAMINATION</em></td></tr> <tr> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;<em>BY FISCAL MELENDRES</em></td></tr> <tr> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>On March 26, 1969, were you already a washer?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>Yes, sir.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>Where were you washing a taxi?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>At Esso.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>What is this Esso?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>At gasoline station.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>Where is this Esso?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>At Araneta Avenue.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>The supposed gasoline station is just across the Shell Station?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>Yes, sir.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">At around two forty that early morning were you in that Esso Gasoline Station?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>Yes, sir.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>What were you doing then?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>I was just standing there waiting for a taxi to be washed.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">While you were standing there, can you tell us if you witnessed anything unusual that happened?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>When I was standing there a taxi stopped.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>Where did that taxi stop?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>In front of the gasoline station.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>How far were you from that taxi?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>One (1) meter.

(TSN, June 19, 1969, pp. 25-30.)</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote> <p>Appellant claims that it was Panganiban who killed Monforte with a <em>balisong</em>. Even assuming this to be true, the evidence indubitably shows that he conspired and cooperated with Panganiban in the latter's vendetta so that as a conspirator he must suffer all the penal consequences of the conspiracy.</p> <p>The fourth assignment of error asserts that the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation should not be appreciated against appellant. But why not? By his own admission he had conspired with Panganiban three days before the incident to avenge the mauling which the latter had suffered at the hands of the deceased. Three days is long enough to reflect on the deed and when it was done persistency of purpose was manifested.</p> <p>The same assignment of error also asserts that appellant "is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction since he finished only the fourth grade (2 tsn July 8, 1969)." (Brief, pp. 20-21.) Suffice it to say that appellant is not lacking in instruction. He finished fourth grade and his literacy is demonstrated by the fact that he signed his sworn statement - Exhibit C. Besides, lack of instruction is not a mitigating circumstance in murder for man who is a rational being has always been forbidden to kill.</p> <p>Appellant's testimony during the trial and his sworn statement do not support the claim that he is a person of low intelligence.</p> <p>Finally, appellant claims that his confession that he participated in the commission of the crime as an "alalay" is analogous to a plea of guilty which should be mitigating. We reject this claim. We would be inclined to accept it if appellant was indeed a mere accomplice but since his guilt is that of a principal the claim has no basis.</p> <p>Appellant is thus guilty of murder and with the attending circumstances the death penalty is warranted. However, for lack of the necessary votes to impose said penalty, the one next lower in degree is called for.</p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed but modified in respect of the principal penalty in that appellant shall suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. Costs against appellant.</p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p> <p><em>Teehankee, Makasiar, Concepcion Jr., Guerrero, De Castro, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Escolin, Vasquez, Relova,</em> and <em>Gutierrez, Jr., JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Fernando, C.J.,</em> in the result.<br><em>Aquino, J.,</em> no part.</p></div>
