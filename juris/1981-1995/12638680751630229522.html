follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>where the relief sought from
the Commission on Human Rights by a party in a case consists of the review and
reversal or modification of a decision or order issued by a court of justice or
government agency or official exercising quasi-judicial functions, may the

<p class="BODY">The facts narrated in the petition are not denied by the

on the legal questions posed in the present action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 17, 1990, a Monday and a class
day, some 800 public school teachers, among them members of the Manila Public
School Teachers Association (MPSTA) and Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) undertook
what they described as "mass concerted actions" to "dramatize
and highlight" their plight resulting from the alleged failure of the
public authorities to act upon grievances that had time and again been brought
to the latter's attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
them they had decided to undertake said "mass concerted actions"
after the protest rally staged at the DECS premises on <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1990</st1:date> without disrupting classes as
a last call for the government to negotiate the granting of demands had
elicited no response from the Secretary of Education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "mass actions" consisted in
staying away from their classes, converging at the <span class="SpellE">Liwasang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, gathering in peaceable assemblies,
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through their representatives, the
teachers participating in the mass actions were served with an order of the
Secretary of Education to return to work in 24 hours or face dismissal, and a
memorandum directing the DECS officials concerned to initiate dismissal
proceedings against those who did not comply and to hire their replacements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those directives notwithstanding, the mass
actions continued into the week, with more teachers joining in the days that
followed.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Among those who took part in the "concerted mass
actions" were the eight (8) private respondents herein, teachers at the
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> High School, Manila, who had agreed
to support the non-political demands of the MPSTA.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"For failure to heed the return-to-work
order, the CHR complainants (private respondents) were administratively charged
on the basis of the principal's report and given five (5) days to answer the
charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were also preventively
suspended for ninety (90) days 'pursuant to Section 41 of P.D. 807' and
temporarily replaced (unmarked CHR Exhibits, Annexes F, G, H).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An investigation committee was consequently
formed to hear the charges in accordance with P.D. 807."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the administrative case docketed as Case
No. DECS 90-082 in which CHR complainants <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Budoy</span>, Jr., <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span> <span class="SpellE">Babaran</span>, Luz del Castillo, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Esber</span> were, among others, named respondents,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the latter filed separate answers, opted for a formal investigation, and also
moved "for suspension of the administrative proceedings pending resolution
by ** (the Supreme) Court of their application for issuance of an injunctive
writ/temporary restraining order." But when their motion for suspension
was denied by Order dated <st1:date year="1990" day="8" month="11">November 8,
 1990</st1:date> of the Investigating Committee, which later also denied their
motion for reconsideration orally made at the hearing of <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1990</st1:date>, "the respondents led by
their counsel staged a walkout signifying their intent to boycott the entire
proceedings."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The case eventually resulted in a Decision of Secretary <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>
dated <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1990</st1:date>,
rendered after evaluation of the evidence as well as the answers, affidavits
and documents submitted by the respondents, decreeing dismissal from the
service of <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Esber</span>
and the suspension for nine (9) months of <span class="SpellE">Babaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Budoy</span> and del Castillo.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the "MPSTA filed a
petition for <i>certiorari </i>before the Regional Trial Court of Manila
against petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>), which was dismissed
(unmarked CHR Exhibit, Annex I).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later,
the MPSTA went to the Supreme Court (on <i>certiorari, </i>in an attempt to
nullify said dismissal, grounded on the) alleged violation of the striking
teachers' right to due process and peaceable assembly docketed as G.R. No.
95445, <i>supra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>The ACT also filed
a similar petition before the Supreme Court ** docketed as G.R. No.
95590."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Both petitions in this Court were filed in behalf of the teacher associations,
a few named individuals, and <i>"other teacher-members so numerous
similarly situated"</i> or <i>"other similarly situated public school
teachers too numerous to be <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>."<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, too, the respondent teachers
submitted sworn statements dated September 27, 1990 to the Commission on Human
Rights to complain that while they were participating in peaceful mass actions,
they suddenly learned of their replacement as teachers, allegedly without
notice and consequently for reasons completely unknown to them.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Their Complaints -- and those of other
teachers also "ordered suspended by the ** (DECS)," all numbering
forty-two (42) -- were docketed as <i>"Striking Teachers CHR Case No.
90-775." </i>In connection therewith the Commission scheduled a
"dialogue" on October 11, 1990, and sent a subpoena to Secretary <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> requiring his attendance therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the day of the "dialogue," although it said that it
was "not certain whether he (Sec. <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>)
received the subpoena which was served at his office, ** (the) Commission, with
the Chairman presiding, and Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Hesiquio</span> R.
<span class="SpellE">Mallillin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Monteiro</span>, proceeded to hear the case;" it heard the
complainants' counsel (a) explain that his clients had been "denied due
process and suspended without formal notice, and unjustly, since they did not
join the mass leave," and (b) expatiate on the grievances which were
"the cause of the mass leave of MPSTA teachers, (and) with which causes
they (CHR complainants) sympathize."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through the Office of the Solicitor General,
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> sought and was granted leave to file
a motion to dismiss the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion
to dismiss was submitted on November 14, 1990 alleging as grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, "that the complaint states no cause of

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an Order dated December 28, 1990,
respondent Commission denied Sec. <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> motion to
dismiss and required him and Superintendent <span class="SpellE">Lolarga</span> <i>"to
submit their counter-affidavits within ten (10) days ** (after which) the

process of law; * * they should not have been replaced without a chance to reply
to the administrative charges;" there had been a violation of their civil
and political rights which the Commission was empowered to investigate; and
while expressing its "utmost respect to the Supreme Court ** the facts
before ** (it) are different from those in the case decided by the Supreme
Court" (the reference being <span class="SpellE">ummistakably</span> to this
Court's joint Resolution of August, 6, 1991 in G.R. Nos. 95445 and 95590, <i>supra).</i></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to invalidate and set aside this Order of December 28, 1990
that the Solicitor General, in behalf of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>,
has commenced the present action of <i>certiorari </i>and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Human Rights has made clear its position that
it does not feel bound by this Court's joint Resolution in G.R. Nos. 95445 and
95590, <i>supra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>It has also made
plain its intention "to hear and resolve the case (i.e., Striking Teachers
HRC Case No. 90-775) on the merits." It intends, in other words, to <i>try
and decide </i>or <i>hear and determine, </i>i.e.,<i> exercise jurisdiction </i>over
the following general issues:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether or not the striking teachers were
denied due process, and just cause exists for the imposition of administrative
disciplinary sanctions on them by their superiors; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether or not the grievances which were
"the cause of the mass leave of MPSTA teachers, (and) with which causes
they (CHR complainants) sympathize," justify their mass action or strike.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission evidently intends to itself <i>adjudicate, </i>that
is to say, determine with character of finality and definiteness, the same
issues which have been passed upon and decided by the Secretary of Education,
Culture &amp; Sports, subject to appeal to the Civil Service Commission, this
Court having in fact, as aforementioned, declared that the teachers affected
may take appeals to the Civil Service Commission on said matters, if still
timely.</p>

<p class="BODY">The threshold question is whether or not the Commission on Human
Rights has the power under the Constitution to do so; whether or not, like a
court of justice,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
or even a quasi-judicial agency,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
it has jurisdiction or adjudicatory powers over, or the power to try and
decide, or hear and determine, certain specific type of cases, like alleged human
rights violations involving civil or political rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court declares the Commission on Human Rights to have no such
power; and that it was not meant by the fundamental law to be another court or
quasi-judicial agency in this country, or duplicate much less take over the
functions of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The most that may be conceded to the Commission in the way of
adjudicative power is that it may <i>investigate, </i>i.e., receive evidence
and make findings of fact as regards claimed human rights violations involving
civil and political rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
fact-finding is not adjudication, and cannot be likened to the <i>judicial
function </i>of a court of justice, or even a quasi-judicial agency or
official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The function of receiving
evidence and ascertaining <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the facts of a
controversy is not a judicial function, properly speaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be considered such, the faculty of
receiving evidence and making factual conclusions in a controversy must be
accompanied by the authority of <i>applying the law to those factual conclusions
to the end that the controversy may be decided or determined authoritatively,
finally and definitively, subject to such appeals or modes of review as may be
provided by law</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><i>

<p class="BODY">The proposition is made clear by the constitutional provisions
specifying the powers of the Commission on Human Rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission was created by the 1987 Constitution as an
independent office.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">As should at once be observed, only the first of the enumerated

clearly and categorically grants to the Commission the power to <i>investigate

initiative or on complaint of any person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may exercise that power pursuant to such rules of procedure as it may
adopt and, in cases of violations of said rules, cite for contempt in
accordance with the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the course of any investigation conducted by it or under its authority, it may
grant immunity from prosecution to any person whose testimony or whose

<p class="BODY">But it cannot try and decide cases (or hear and determine causes)
as courts of justice, or even quasi-judicial bodies do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To investigate is not to adjudicate or
adjudge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether in the popular or the
technical sense, these terms have well understood and quite distinct meanings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>"Investigate," </i>commonly understood, means to
examine, explore, inquire or delve or probe into, research on, study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dictionary definition of “investigate” is
"to observe or study closely:<span style="">&nbsp;

The purpose of investigation, of course, is to discover, to find out, to learn,

<p class="BODY">Hence it is that the Commission on Human Rights, having merely
the power "to investigate," cannot and should not "try and
resolve on the merits" (adjudicate) the matters involved in Striking
Teachers HRC Case No. 90-775, as it has announced it means to do; and it cannot
do so even if there be a claim that in the administrative disciplinary
proceedings against the teachers in question, initiated and conducted by the
DECS, their human rights, or civil or political rights had been
transgressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More particularly, the
Commission has no power to "resolve on the merits" the question of
(a) whether or not the mass concerted actions engaged in by the teachers
constitute a strike and are prohibited or otherwise restricted by law; (b)
whether or not the act of carrying on and taking part in those actions, and the
failure of the teachers to discontinue those actions and return to their
classes despite the order to this effect by the Secretary of Education,
constitute infractions of relevant rules and regulations warranting
administrative disciplinary sanctions, or are justified by the grievances
complained of by them; and (c) what were the particular acts done by each
individual teacher and what sanctions, if any, may properly be imposed for said
acts or omissions.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are matters undoubtedly and clearly within the original jurisdiction
of the Secretary of Education, being within the scope of the disciplinary
powers granted to him under the Civil Service Law, and also, within the
appellate jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the Secretary of Education has, as above narrated,
already taken cognizance of the issues and resolved them,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
and it appears that appeals have been seasonably taken by the aggrieved parties
to the Civil Service Commission; and even this Court itself has had occasion to
pass upon said issues.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, it is quite obvious that whether or not the conclusions
reached by the Secretary of Education in disciplinary cases are correct and are
adequately based on substantial evidence; whether or not the proceedings themselves
are void or defective in not having accorded the respondents due process; and
whether or not the Secretary of Education had in truth committed "human
rights violations involving civil and political rights," are matters which
may be passed upon and determined through a motion for reconsideration
addressed to the Secretary of Education himself, and in the event of an adverse
verdict, may be reviewed by the Civil Service Commission and eventually by the
Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Human Rights simply has no place in this scheme
of things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no business intruding
into the jurisdiction and functions of the Education Secretary or the Civil
Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no business
going over the same ground traversed by the latter and making its own judgment
on the questions involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would
accord success to what may well have been the complaining teachers strategy to
abort, frustrate or negate the judgment of the Education Secretary in the
administrative cases against them which they anticipated would be adverse to
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">This cannot be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
will not be permitted to be done.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the investigation by the Commission on Human Rights
would serve no useful purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If its
investigation should result in conclusions contrary to those reached by
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, it would have no power anyway to
reverse the Secretary's conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reversal thereof can only by done by the Civil Service Commission and
lastly by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing the
Commission can do, if it concludes that Secretary <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>
was in error, is to refer the matter to the appropriate Government agency or
tribunal for assistance; that would be the Civil Service Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>

Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">I wish to add however that the Commission on Human Rights should

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not only with the human rights of striking
teachers but also the human rights of students and their parents;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;"><span style="">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>not </span>only with the human rights of the accused but also the human
rights of the victims and the latter’s families;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not only with the human rights of those who
rise against the government but also those who defend the same:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4) not only the
human rights of striking laborers but also those who as a consequence of
strikes may be laid off because of financial repercussions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of human rights is not <span style="">a </span>monopoly of a <span style="">government
agency (such as the Commission on Human Rights) nor the monopoly of </span>a <span style="">group of lawyers </span>defending so-called
“human rights” but the responsibility of ALL AGENCIES (governmental or private)
and of ALL LAWYERS, JUDGES, and JUSTICES.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the Commission
should realize that while there are </span>“<u>human</u> <u><span style="">rights</span></u><span style="">”, </span><span style="">there are also
