entitled; "HEIRS OF THE LATE FILOMENA VDA. DE CAYETANO, petitioners,
versus HONORABLE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH IV, DEPUTY SHERIFF
ANDRES BONIFACIO AND FRANCISCO M. ANGELES, respondents."</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Mendoza were the registered owners of a lot in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 42347.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pablo died on <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> and her children, private respondents herein,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isaias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>, Pablo, Jr.,
Laura, Jose, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">executed an extrajudicial </span>settlement
and sale of his estate, whereby <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> sold their shares to their mother, and the other
children (except Manuel who had predeceased his parents), transferred their
shares to her, so that <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> and the three (3)
children of Manuel became the co-owners of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the registration of the deed of
extrajudicial settlement and sale, TCT No. 42347 was cancelled and TCT No.
68065 was issued to <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> and the children of Manuel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 10, 1980, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> sold to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">one-half </span>(1/2)

issued to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>

with the sale his mother made to him, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
presented to the R<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">egister of </span>Deeds
of Manila an Agreement of Partition of Common Property purportedly signed by
all the heirs of Pablo, including <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>,
adjudicating to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> the same one-half (1/2)
portion of the property which had previously been sold by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on that document, the
Register of Deeds of Manila issued on December 14, 1981, TCT No. 146787 to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> for his one-half portion (Lot 40-A) and TCT No.
146788 to <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> and the children of Manuel, for
the other half.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 84-25611, private respondents asked for a writ

on the same day when the private respondents filed their petition for <i>certiorari</i>

prayed that the order dated <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="8">August 23,

implementation of the writ of possession and the public respondents are ordered
to restore them in the possession of the premises which possession should be
respected pending the final adjudication of their claims thereto in Civil Case
No. 84­-25611."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Angeles filed a motion for reconsideration which was, however,
denied in the resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="6">June
 25, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
present petition for review on <i>certiorari.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">This petition basically questions only the main finding of
respondent court that the writ of possession issued by the trial court cannot
be implemented against the private respondents, particularly the plaintiffs in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Civil </span>Case No. 84-25611.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in">In support of his petition, Angeles
alleges that he was an innocent mortgagee and purchaser for value <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and </span>in good faith since he was not
aware of any flaw whatsoever in the title of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>,
it being clear of any liens and encumbrances at the time of the execution of
the real estate mortgage contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Angeles submits next that notices of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> were recorded on <span class="SpellE">Juanito's</span>
title almost two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(2) </span>years after
the registration of the real estate mortgage contracts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

 8, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on the basis
of Bank of the Philippine Islands, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>,
etc., et al., 105 Phil. 418, any subsequent lien or encumbrance at the back of
the certificate of title cannot, in any way, prejudice the mortgage previously
registered and the lot subject thereto passes to the purchaser at the public
auction sale, free from liens or encumbrances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the same manner, the letter dated April 20, 1982, which is much later
in point of time to the registration of the real estate mortgage contracts, has
no more material significance other than a mere scrap of paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Angeles, who is first in time, is preferred
in right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Angeles avers also that the
writ of possession under Act 3135, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>amended,
is a right given a purchaser in an extra-judicial foreclosure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Finally,
</span>Angeles contends that the period within which the orders of the trial
judge may be impugned by appeal has already elapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that the remedy of <i>certiorari</i>
cannot be a substitute for appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the respondent court that there is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">no merit in </span>the allegation that Angeles
was an innocent mortgagee and purchaser for value and in good faith (pp. 39-40,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

discharge the mortgage debt and <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the property
to them on the ground that the Partition Agreement was a forgery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent acknowledged receipt
of that notice and even assured the petitioners that he would not dispose of
the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Cayetano's</span> certificate of title was clean when he mortgaged
it to Angeles will not protect the mortgagee from the unregistered claims or
rights of the other heirs of <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Mendoza since,
at the time of the foreclosure sale the mortgagee had actual knowledge of such
adverse claims or rights of the other heirs of <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">since</span> it runs
counter to the facts on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

title later, or on June 22 and 27, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, the determination of whether or not Angeles was an innocent
mortgagee and purchaser for value and in good faith is of little significance,
because of the following more important considerations that We shall now
elucidate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under section 6 of Act No. 3135 and sections 29 to 31 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>section 35 of Rule 39 of the
Revised Rules of Court, in case of an extrajudicial foreclosure of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">a </span>real state mortgage, the possession
of the property sold <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">may </span>be given
to the purchaser by the sheriff after the period of redemption had expired (IFC
Service Leasing and Acceptance Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Nera</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21720, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 30, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 19 SCRA 181; <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gapultos</span>, G.R. No. 51574-77, </span><st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 30, 1984</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 132 SCRA 429).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
same rule was followed in a judicial foreclosure of mortgage and in an
execution sale (Rivera v. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, 61 Phil. 201).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We also held that it is ministerial upon the court to issue a writ of
possession in favor of the purchaser in a foreclosure sale of a mortgaged
property (De <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">los</span></span>
  Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>, etc., et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-34317, </span><st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 30, 1974</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 60 SCRA 116).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> provision provides
for an exception, that is, "unless a third party is actually holding the
property adversely to the judgment debtor." In the case at bar, the writ
of possession ordered the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> not only of
"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the spouses <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> and
Antoinette <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>, their agents" but included
also "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> other
persons in possession of the premises" which, in this case, were the
private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> de Ortega v. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, etc., et al., 71 Phil. 340, <span class="GramE">We</span>
held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
where a party in possession was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>party
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>foreclosure, and did not
acquire <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">his </span>possession from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a person who was </span>bound by the decree,
but who is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>mere stranger and
who entered into possession before the suit was begun, the court has no power
to deprive him of possession by enforcing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>(See 2 <span class="SpellE">Wiltsie</span> on Mortgage Foreclosure, 1061-1062; 3 Jones on
Mortgages, 301; and the cases cited therein).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it was held that only parties to the suit, persons who came in
under them <span class="SpellE">pendente</span> <span class="SpellE">lite</span>,
and trespassers or intruders without title, can be evicted by a writ of
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Thompson v. Campbell, 57 <st1:state><st1:place>Ala.</st1:place></st1:state>
183, 188; Cooper v. Cloud, 194 <st1:state><st1:place>Ala.</st1:place></st1:state>,
449, 452).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this
limitation is that the writ does not issue in case of doubt, nor will a
question of legal title be tried or decided in proceedings looking to the
exercise of the power of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>court
to put a purchaser in possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A very
serious question may arise upon full proofs as to where the legal title to the
property rests, and should not be disposed of in a summary way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, it is held, should be
required to establish his title in a proceeding directed to that end."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is clear from the foregoing that the
writ of possession may not be enforced against the private respondents inasmuch
as 1) they possess the property adversely, as evidenced by the cases they filed
(Civil Case No. 84-25611) for annulment of the sale their mother made to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> and the partition agreement, and (Criminal Case No.
82-12849) for falsification of the partition agreement; 2) they were not
parties to the mortgages executed by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> in favor
of Angeles nor to the foreclosure proceedings; 3) they have been in possession
even prior to the foreclosure sale; and 4) they did not derive the right to
possess the land from <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> but from Pablo, the
original owner of the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>Bank of
the Philippine Islands, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>, etc., et
al., <u>supra</u>, cited by Angeles is not in point because the issue there was
whether or not the notice <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>adverse
claim may be cancelled and removed from the new certificates of title, which is
obviously not the issue here.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly held by the respondent court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>issuing the writ of possession also
against the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">respondents, </span>the
trial judge clearly acted without or in excess of his jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation that the period within which the orders of the
trial judge may be impugned by appeal has already elapsed was not substantiated
by facts to show that the period has indeed elapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Brushing aside this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">allegation, <i>certiorari </i></span>is the proper remedy when appeal is
inadequate and will not promptly relieve private respondents from the injurious
effects of the judgment (see Romero, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R.

been an adequate remedy in view of the speedy implementation of the writ of
possession against the private respondents who were ejected from the premises.</p>
