<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span>evidence
presented by the prosecution during the trial may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the early morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">15
 September 1983</st1:date>, Police Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>
was advised by an informant in the <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> area that a
woman by the name of "Sally", a <st1:street><st1:address>Metro Aide
  street</st1:address></st1:street> sweeper assigned along <st1:street><st1:address>Jose
  <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
was selling marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> conveyed this information to Lt. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span>, Chief of the Anti-Narcotics Group, Western Police
District, Manila Police Department, who then dispatched a police team -
composed of Sgt. Jose <span class="SpellE">Santoyo</span> as leader of the team,
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Siochi</span>, Sgt.
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Guitan</span> and Sgt. Enrique David - to meet with
Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> at <st1:street><st1:address>Jose <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The policemen set a trap to catch
"Sally".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sum of P120.00,
in five P20 bills and four P5 bills, which had been supplied by Lt. <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span>, was given to Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In turn, Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>
marked the peso bills and gave them to the informant at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Moriones</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police
operatives saw the accused <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>, engaged in carrying out her job <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><st1:street><st1:address>Metro
  Aide street</st1:address></st1:street> sweeper at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Moriones</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sande</span> Streets. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The policemen deployed themselves
inconspicuously around the area so that they could observe the expected
transaction between the informant and the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span> was then standing on top of the concrete island at
the middle of the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
approached by the informant and the two conversed with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The informant gave the accused the marked
money and the latter walked towards the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place> area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of
</span>the police operatives - <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. David and <span class="SpellE">Guitan</span> - followed her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thirty minutes later, <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span> came back with a small yellow plastic <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">bag </span>which
she handed over to the informant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Santoyo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">being </span>closest
to the spot where the transaction took place, approached and immediately
arrested <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>
subjected <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>
to a body search and found P50.00 of the marked money in her right back pants'
pocket.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>
was taken to the police headquarters and there subjected to questioning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the outset, she denied selling marijuana
to the informant but later on she admitted having done so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the police report, the accused
"pointed to one Vena" and another person by the name of "<span class="SpellE">Nanding</span>" of Pacheco Street, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>,
Manila as her suppliers of marijuana.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> She
expressed fear of reprisal should she formally charge them with selling
marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The yellow plastic bag with its contents was forwarded to the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Forensic Laboratory for
examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The examining NBI Chemist
Ms. Carolyn Y. <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>, issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>certification
to the effect that the "dried marijuana leaves contained in a yellow
plastic bag <span class="SpellE">labelled</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span>

<p class="BODY">The defense of the accused consisted of a denial that she had
sold the dried marijuana leaves to the police informant in the morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">15 September 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She contended that she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>"being
framed by the police".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She admitted that about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">15
 September 1983</st1:date>, a man in civilian clothes, <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>companion
of Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>, had approached her at her place
of work and told her that someone had "pointed to [her] --- [as] selling
marijuana".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She denied receiving
any money and leaving her post for about thirty (30) minutes, it being
prohibited for Metro Aides to leave their posts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also denied that P50 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span>bills of
different denominations, were found in her back pocket stating that she had no
back pocket but rather a patch sewn unto the seat of her pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused further declared that she saw the
yellow plastic bag containing the dried marijuana leaves for the first time
during the trial of her case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
pointed to someone by the name of Ramirez as owner of the dried marijuana
leaves, claiming that Ramirez had falsely identified her as owner of the
plastic bag because he had a grudge against her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This grudge, according to the accused, arose
because a nephew of Ramirez, one Mario Ramirez, had become her lover to the
consternation and resentment of Mario's parents who tried every means to break
up the affair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Francia</span> declared that she had eventually broken up
her affair with Mario.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also presented Rosemarie <span class="SpellE">Kiskisan</span>,
a <st1:street><st1:address>Metro Aide street</st1:address></st1:street> sweeper
too, who worked with the accused in the same area in the morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">15 September 1983</st1:date>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Kiskisan</span> said that
she was close by <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>
when the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">was </span>arrested by the police officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kiskisan</span> declared,
however, that the accused never left her place of work that morning since this
was not allowed by their superiors during their 15-minute coffee break at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A third defense witness, Mario <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>, Metro Aide Foreman of <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Francia</span> and Rosemarie <span class="SpellE">Kiskisan</span>,
similarly declared that the accused could not have left her place of work at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">15 September 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Trias</span> stated that
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time> that morning, he
happened to be at the assigned work place of <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span> and he saw her there at that time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused appellant contends that the trial court erred in
giving weight to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and in disregarding
or discounting the testimony of the <span class="SpellE">defence’s</span>
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused appellant,
however, has not indicated precisely where the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">erred, what it is in the testimony of the
prosecution witnesses that should have been disregarded and what it is in the
testimony of the defense witnesses that should have been ascribed greater
weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The familiar rule in this
jurisdiction on the matter of relative credibility of the witnesses is that
"unless there is a showing that the trial court had overlooked,
misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and
substance that would have affected the result of the case, the appellate court
will not disturb the factual findings of the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, having had the opportunity of observing
the demeanor and behavior of the witnesses while testifying, the trial court,
more than the reviewing tribunal, is in a better position to gauge their
credibility and properly appreciate the relative weight of the often
conflicting evidence for both parties".</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the trial court believed the witnesses of the
"prosecution rather than those of the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>,
an eyewitness, was direct and straightforward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in the record to suggest that Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> or any of the other prosecution witnesses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>moved
by any motive other than simply the carrying out of their official mission or
duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Patog</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court explained that "where there is no evidence, and nothing to
indicate the principal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">witness for the
prosecution was actuated by improper motives, the presumption is that he was
not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit".</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The witnesses for the prosecution moreover
have in their favor the presumption that as police officers charged with law
enforcement duties, they have regularly performed their duties in the absence
of evidence to the contrary.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two defense witnesses, Mario <span class="SpellE">Trias</span> and
Rosemarie <span class="SpellE">Kiskisan</span>, testified that the accused never
left her post <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the morning
when she was apprehended by the police officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two witnesses stated that it was against
rules and regulations for <span class="SpellE">Rosalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>
to leave her post during the day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was, </span>however, no testimony or any
other proof to show that it was physically impossible for the accused to have
left her place of work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mario <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>, moreover, who was not physically present at or
around the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> work area the whole morning, was
clearly <u>not</u> in a position to testify that the accused <u>never</u> left
her area of work even for thirty minutes in the morning of 15 September 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn to the argument of the accused that the police informer
had "framed" her up because she had been the lover of one Mario
Ramirez, a nephew of the informer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming that this claimed love affair had in fact taken place, it
appears to this Court as too petty and inadequate a motive to support such a
serious act as falsely implicating a person in a violation of the Prohibited
Drugs Act which carries with it life imprisonment as a penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claimed illicit affair was over and done
with before the entrapment and arrest of the accused took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither are we convinced by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> claim that the marijuana was not hers but that of
the informer; assuming such claim was correct, the accused was unable to
explain away the marked bills found in the back pocket of her pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the prosecution to present the
informer as a witness does not substantially affect the prosecution's case; the
informer's testimony would have been merely corroborative and cumulative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the accused appellant claimed that
she personally knew the informer and where he resided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would follow that the defense could have
easily required the informer to have been subpoenaed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, however, the defense never applied for issuance of a subpoena to the
informer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused also contends that the information sheet (Exhibit
"A") was taken in violation of her constitutional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">rights </span>because she was not provided
with counsel at the time of her investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The information sheet contained the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>"Suspect when investigated was apprised of her constitutional
rights to Counsel to remain silent and the crime she is being charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She verbally admitted her guilt and added
that the <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">source of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">One </span>notes that the
record is bare of any suggestion of any sign of physical injuries upon the body
of the accused, and that the accused never complained either to the police
authorities or to the court that she had been maltreated or that violence had
been exercised upon her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This matter,
however, need not detain us, for on the view most favorable to the accused and
assuming, for purposes of argument only, that the above-mentioned statement was
obtained and presented in violation of her constitutional rights, still there
was more than enough independent evidence to show the guilt of the accused
appellant beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
eye-witness, Police Corporal <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> testified
directly and positively, giving all the requisite details of the entrapment
operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the assaying of the value
and credibility of evidence, witnesses are weighed and not numbered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The testimony of a single witness if credible and positive and if satisfies the
court as to the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, is sufficient to
convict.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
