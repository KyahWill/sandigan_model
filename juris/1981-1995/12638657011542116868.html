				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Rape is a very emotional word, and the natural human reactions to
it are categorical:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>admiration and
sympathy for the courageous female publicly seeking retribution for her
outrageous violation, and condemnation of the rapist.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, being interpreters of the law and dispensers of justice,
we must look at a rape charge without those proclivities, and deal with it with
extreme caution and circumspection.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, we must free ourselves of the natural tendency to be
overprotective of every woman decrying her having been sexually <span class="GramE">abused,</span> and demanding punishment for the abuser.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are cognizant of the anguish and
humiliation the rape victim goes through as she <span class="GramE">demands</span>
justice, but our responsibility is to render justice based on the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second is the other side of the coin, wherein the culpability of
the accused must be examined with utmost objectivity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the Court has held that it takes a
woman with remarkable courage to report to the authorities, and inevitably, bring
to public knowledge, her violation, we must also look upon the accused as we
must in all cases where men are criminally charged, that is, as innocent until
proven otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so because a
charge of rape perforce throws the accused into the status of a pariah to be
feared and avoided like the plague; such a state is not dissimilar to an actual
finding of the accused as guilty of the crime in which case he is officially
removed from public and social circulation for life--reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
evidence for the prosecution must be so strong as to prove the accused guilty
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, it is not required that the evidence presented by the defense must be so
convincing as to absolve the accused of the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Simply put, what is decisive is the strength
of the prosecution's case as shown by its proof; that of the accused is of
little moment, if at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the horrendous nature and consequence of the charge of
rape, the victim must show that indeed she has been bodily violated, forcibly
and against her will, and has brought the matter to the authorities out of
righteous indignation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A charge of rape
cannot be a fanciful whimsy as its consequences compel the courts to examine,
analyze, and evaluate painstakingly, the facts of the case, and come away with
the conviction that the victim has been telling the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case now before us, an appeal from the decision of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XXV,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
convicting the accused of rape under Article 335, paragraph 1 of the Revised
Penal Code, "by means of force, violence and intimidation,"
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>,
and requiring him to indemnify the complainant in the sum of P20,000 as
"consolidated damages," we are tasked with weighing the evidence
against the accused to see if he indeed should be put away for life.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant is Czarina Santos, who in March 1983 was 17 years
old and a graduating student at <st1:place><st1:placename>Christian</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Hope</st1:placename> <st1:placename>High School</st1:placename></st1:place>

filed a complaint of rape against Michael Herrick, 38, an American citizen,
divorced, an importer by occupation, living in this country since <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1975</st1:date>, and who at the
time he was charged, had taken up residence at <st1:street><st1:address>102 <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mactan</span></st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">Examining meticulously the records of the case, we have tried to
see if Czarina Santos’ complaint can stand the scrutiny of factual
evaluation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had she evidenced the
natural behavior of a victim of rape?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Or, had her actuations been such that her claim to having been violated
becomes subject to doubt as to its truth and correctness?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had she shown genuine grief, tried to flee
from the scene of her violation, <span class="GramE">shunned</span> her
violator?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or, could it have been out of
pique, on her part or on her <span class="GramE">family, that</span> impelled her
to cry "rape"?</p>

<p class="BODY">The reported ravishment of the complainant did not take place
only once, but purportedly four times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And yet, strangely, she has accused the appellant of only one crime of
rape--just the first.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Czarina is seeking
vindication for only one abuse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She has
chosen to ignore altogether three succeeding defilements she allegedly suffered
three nights in a row in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first rape was supposed to have been committed at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1983</st1:date>, in a private room of
the Las Palmas Hotel in <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The alleged first rape had been committed on the fourth time the complainant
met the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their first meeting had
been on February 15, 1983<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
when she was interviewed by the accused for possible employment, the latter
having plans to open an outlet at the <span class="SpellE">Pistahang</span>
Pilipino,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> a
commercial complex specializing in Philippine handicrafts located just
diagonally across the street from the Las Palmas Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant was supposedly asked to
report back to the accused after her high school graduation, on <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant and the accused met the second time when the
accused attended her graduation, after which both were invited by the mother of
the complainant's best friend and classmate, <span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span>
Jordan, 18, to a "blow-out" dinner at a Chinese restaurant in <span class="SpellE">Ongpin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Her father and mother did not attend Czarina's high school graduation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused undoubtedly showed some interest in Czarina when he
again attended her Citizen’s Army Training (C.A.T.) closing rites two days
later, on March 25, 1983:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>his presence
at the rites and their having lunch at the Jordan family residence in <span class="SpellE">Bacood</span>, Sta. Mesa thereafter was their third time to be
together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Czarina went home at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening, and was given a
tongue-lashing by her mother who did not approve of her going out with <span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The scolding
culminated in the slapping of Czarina by her mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Czarina left her house and called up <span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span> who agreed to meet her at the Las Palmas Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at the lobby of the hotel<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
that Czarina and Herrick met for the fourth time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she entered the lobby, she saw him and
his secretary, Mildred <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>, who forthwith took her
to Room 618 where <span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span> was waiting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Left to themselves, Czarina told her best
friend of her having run away from home; of her parents’ belief that she had
not been chaste, and of their decision not to send her to college.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span> comforted
her and assured that Michael Herrick might help her out of her predicament as
he was a generous man and one who could be easily trusted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

After a while, when her feelings had been assuaged, Czarina went out with <span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gerosa's</span> brothers,
Mildred, Michael Herrick, and two other girls, to dance at the <span class="SpellE">Galactica</span> Disco at the V.V. <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span>
Building at <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos Avenue (EDSA).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
Mildred and Czarina were at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Domestic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to buy Czarina a plane ticket for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

After buying the ticket, the two returned to the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at the hotel that Czarina was
allegedly raped for the first time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Czarina testified that at about 2:00
o'clock in the morning of March 26, 1983, she was awakened "because I felt
that somebody was on top of me, kissing me...I opened my eyes, and I saw
Michael on top of me...I pushed him…I wiggled my body and pleaded to him not to
do anything...I shouted but he covered my mouth and even my nose...with his
hand...He told me not to resist anymore or else he is going to kill
me...Because I felt very weak and very nervous, I did not do anything
anymore...He took off my underwear...My panty…He placed his penis on top of my
vagina...Suddenly, I felt a searing pain...I lost consciousness...(I regained
consciousness) in the morning... I saw Michael still hugging me... I cried and
tried to free myself and I tried to stand up but I can't... I felt the pain all
over my body, my legs, my back... I grabbed a blanket and covered my body with
it...Michael woke up...He found me crying and told me that I can do nothing
anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't have to worry because
he was going to take care of everything...After that, he ordered me to get
dressed...Yes, sir (I got dressed)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It must be noted that the complainant testified that the accused, who
threatened to kill her if she mentioned the incident to anybody, was not armed
with a deadly weapon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What baffles us is that the complainant put on her clothes under
the direction of her supposed rapist, then, along with Mildred, accompanied the
same rapist to the domestic airport, where he took the <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> morning flight to <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span>
in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After Michael Herrick's departure, Czarina
waited at the airport for the <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>
flight for the same city, boarded it, and upon arrival at the southern airport,
was met by Josephine "<span class="SpellE">Gigi</span>" <span class="SpellE">Egot</span>, a secretary of Michael Herrick, who then took her to
Michael Herrick's apartment in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

In the evening, Czarina went disco-dancing with the accused and some
companions, and during the four nights that she stayed in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
she was allegedly raped again by the accused three times.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Czarina's parents were very upset by their
daughter's disappearance since the slapping incident in the evening of <st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1983</st1:date>, they went to the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>
Western Police District, to report that their daughter was missing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The search for Czarina led to a phone call from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
made by Mildred to Herrick in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
saying that Czarina had run away from home.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
When Herrick confronted Czarina, the latter admitted that she had indeed flown
the coop and said she was afraid to go back because of what her father might do
to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father, however, insisted
that she return home, and bought a plane ticket for her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Czarina was not able to use that ticket as
Josephine had borrowed money from someone for the purchase of two tickets--one
for Czarina and another for herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the confrontation, Michael Herrick flew back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following day, Czarina and Josephine took
the early <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6:00 A.M.</st1:time> PAL flight bound for
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Czarina and Josephine arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Domestic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
they were met by Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM) personnel who brought them
to the police precinct on <st1:street><st1:address>United Nations Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Czarina saw her parents, she broke down.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top:12.0pt">The next day, the medico-legal officer
of the Western Police District examined Czarina for physical injuries and
vaginal lacerations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His findings were
that the examinee's "hymen (was) relatively thick, circular in shape with
deep old lacerations at <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00</st1:time> and past
<st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> positions with rounding

Explaining these findings in laymen's terms, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Cenido</span> testified that "(T)<span class="SpellE">hese</span>
are lacerations of the hymen which are the result of a previous sexual
intercourse prior…or the introduction of the penis into the vagina prior to the
incident of the alleged rape" (on March 26, 1983).<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top:12.0pt">Having examined the evidence of the
prosecution, we now turn to that of the defense whose witnesses corroborate one
another's testimonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those testimonies
essentially point to the weakness of the evidence, as well as to its paucity,
presented by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, defense witness Mildred <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>,

Lodge on Monica Street, <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, Manila, on March 26,

statement was corroborated by Andres E. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>,
receiving clerk at the lodge, who testified that the two stayed at the lodge

<p class="BODY">Curiously, after the alleged rape, Czarina dressed up, went with

airport she was met by Josephine "<span class="SpellE">Gigi</span>" <span class="SpellE">Egot</span>, 21, single, and a secretary at MR Exporters, which
was managed by Michael Herrick.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Josephine brought her to Michael's apartment at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
After resting, Czarina went out with one of Michael's housekeepers to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Marigondon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that evening, she went to dinner and to a
discotheque with Michael and Josephine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The following two evenings also found her at the disco house in the same
company.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her testimony, Josephine <span class="SpellE">Egot</span>
claimed that in one of her conversations with Czarina, the latter asked how she
could win Michael's love, and whether she could do that by "<span class="SpellE">gayuma</span>" or "muscle control."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Josephine said she stopped this kind of conversation, showing her disapproval.</p>

<p class="BODY">Czarina arrived together with Josephine at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Domestic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1983</st1:date>, and upon
seeing her parents, she broke down and cried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Only then did she make the "confession" that she had been
raped by the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, we make the following observations:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are convinced that
the complainant did not seriously resist the alleged sexual advances of the
accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The medical
examination of Czarina conducted on <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1983</st1:date>, a day after her arrival from <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, showed not a scintilla of extra-genital
injuries although there were indications of "deep old lacerations" of
the hymen resulting from intercourse before her alleged rape (first) on <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the doctor found no fresh <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> lacerations.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The absence of indications of a recent rape when ordinarily there should have
been signs of new lacerations, and of external injuries on any part of the
complainant's body that would have shown her violent struggle to preserve her
chastity, considering that she claimed she had been raped four times (once in
Manila and thrice in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>), compel us to seriously
question the probability of the complainant's accusation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary rule is
that "in crimes against chastity the testimony of the injured woman must
not be received with precipitate credulity; and when the conviction depends at
any vital point upon her uncorroborated testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should not be accepted unless her
sincerity and candor are free from suspicion."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find it hard to believe that the "stinging pain"
caused by her violation knocked her unconscious for four hours--from 2:00
o'clock to 7:00 o'clock in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If she had been unconscious for that long, she would have ended up in
the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Corollary
to this point, why would Michael tarry by her side after the rape?</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not the natural tendency of a man to
remain for long by the side of the woman he had raped.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, we are intrigued by Czarina's behavior after her
alleged rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A woman's conduct
immediately after the assault is of utmost importance in the resolution of a
rape case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of Czarina, she failed to contact her parents, or tell her best
friend <span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span>, about her defloration by Herrick.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor did she leave the hotel room where she
had supposedly been raped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A rape
victim's natural reaction upon regaining consciousness and discovering that she
was naked and that she had been violated, would be to put on her clothes, and
rush out to seek help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Czarina did none
of these.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find even more
incredible the idea of a victim of rape voluntarily accompanying her violator
to the domestic airport, and later flying in the next plane to join him in a
faraway city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How can a victim of rape
agree to a rendezvous with her alleged abuser?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While she was waiting for her flight, she chatted with people (some
military personnel at that), although showing some uneasiness and looking
sleepy,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
and read the morning papers, but she did nothing to start the process of
vindicating her honor--like complaining to the military security persons around
her that she had been raped earlier that morning and soliciting their
help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, she simply and patiently
waited for her flight that would reunite her with her supposed abuser.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination,
she was asked what had transpired between her and Herrick when they were in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, and she said, "He had sex with me
for three consecutive nights," during the four nights that she stayed in
his apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked what she did,
if she shouted or kept silent when she was being abused, she said, "I just
kept silent."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of
fatherly affection and concern by Czarina's father is belied by the
records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he was very
strict with his children and took good care of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Czarina testified that nobody from her
family attended her high school graduation, which is an important watershed in
a young persons’ life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Santos gave
flimsy excuses for his absence at his daughter's graduation:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>he was very busy with his law practice, that
he had to attend to a more important matter on that day, and that the
graduation was not a very special occasion as Czarina did not graduate with
flying colors.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the trial court showed pique over the actuations
of the accused, whose police record is not exactly spotless, there having been
charges lodged against him previously.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had figured in an automobile accident and was charged for reckless
imprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His landlady in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> had filed a case against him for
malicious mischief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mely's</span>
Export Trading in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> filed

<p class="BODY">Trial Judge <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> C. Cui, now
Justice of the Court of Appeals, found Herrick guilty:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Defendant Michael Herrick is an
unusually big man--5 feet and 11 inches in height, and 210 pounds in
weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is divorced and was 39 years
old at the time he gave his direct testimony on <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was petulantly glib as he gave his testimony, noticeably interspersed
with pejorative remarks like 'Immigration told me I can buy anything I want,’ x

has a macho inclination towards the erotic, as shown by the suggestive pictures
he took in his hotel room of <span class="SpellE">Gerosa</span> Jordan (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">F, F-1, F-2 and F-3)."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">"Defendant's physical build equips him with adequate
strength to overpower Czarina the way she said he did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And his ingrained petulance and deprecating
attitude to things Filipino could have been a decisive leverage in making
defendant believe that he could do anything and then walk away from it with a
defense strung together by audacious testimonies.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">We have taken note, as obviously the lower court had, with
contempt, of the arrogance of the accused-appellant, as when, for example, he
referred to "the honest fiscal over there," which is like saying
there are "dishonest fiscals here." He made references as well to
things being easily had in this country if one had money.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

As a foreigner who earns his livelihood in this country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Herrick should show more respect for the
Philippine courts and institutions and raise charges of anomaly or irregularity
against erring members of the court or government officials in the proper
venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, judgment on the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
culpability must not be colored by one's prejudices and biases against the
accused, even if these had actually been inspired by the accused himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A judge should be able to put his dislike for
the accused aside and determine judiciously from the facts presented whether or
not the accused is guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well to note that despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the rape case against the accused, he petitioned for, and was granted,
permission to leave the country twice, first on <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1983</st1:date>, returning on <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1983</st1:date>, and again on <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1983</st1:date>, returning just over a month later, on <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could have elected not to return to this
country during those times he was allowed to leave it, yet he chose to return,
knowing that the charge of rape slapped on him is unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tested in the light of human nature and experience, we find
wanting the credibility of the testimony of the offended party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the requirement of moral certainty
has not been met.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>
