APPEALS, HON. EUTROPIO MIGRIÑO, PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE RTC OF PASIG, BRANCH
151, ADELA MENDOZA AND CECILIO MENDOZA AND THE BRANCH SHERIFF OF THE RTC OF
PASIG, BRANCH 151, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On April 14, 1975, the petitioner, Laura Mateo, filed an action
in the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Rizal.  (1) to annul a deed of sale of a half-hectare parcel of land in Las
Piñas which she had executed in favor of the spouses, Adela and Cecilia
Mendoza, in 1970, and (2) to cancel the Mendozas’ TCT No. 275004 with
damages.  The trial court, in a decision
dated October 10, 1983, dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the action
had prescribed and that it was "unfounded and frivolous" (p. 31,
Rollo).  The plaintiff filed a notice of
appeal on October 28, 1983 signifying her intention to appeal the decision to
the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Three (3) years later, the trial court discovered that the records
had not been forwarded to the Court of Appeals, so on January 16, 1986, it
ordered the clerk of court to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three (3) more years passed without the clerk of court nor the
appellant having taken any steps to ele­vate the records to the Court of Appeals.  Consequently, the defendants (Mendoza
spouses) through counsel, filed in the trial court on April 10, 1989 a Motion
to Disal­low Appeal.  The plaintiff
opposed the motion.  She alleged that
the delay in the transmittal of the records of the case to the appellate court
was "not attributa­ble to the plaintiff." Furthermore, "if there
are missing papers or documents in the records x x x plaintiff is very much
ready and willing to give whatever assistance [is needed] in reconstituting
said missing papers" (p. 36, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 14, 1989, the Court issued an order granting the
plaintiff ten (10) days "within which to furnish this Court with copies of
the missing tran­scripts of stenographic notes so that the records of this case
can be elevated to the Court of Appeals" (p. 37, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 16, 1989, the defendants filed a Second Motion to Disallow
Appeal which the plaintiff did not oppose despite the Court's order for her to
comment thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the plaintiff failed to live up to her undertaking "to
give whatever assistance [was needed] in reconstituting said missing
papers," (p. 37, Rollo) the trial court on June 19, 1989, granted the
defendants' second motion to di<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">s</span>allow
the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's counsel filed a motion for reconsideration explaining
that this failure to comply with his undertaking to reconstitute some missing
records of the case was due to the fact that he had been suffering from urinary
tract infection.  Moreover, he was never
informed what the missing records were.  He argued that the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>without
jurisdiction and gravely abused its discretion in disallowing his client's
appeal be­cause the appeal had already been perfected, hence, it could no
longer be disallowed; what remained to be done was only the transmittal of the
records to the appellate court which was solely the duty of the clerk of court
and court personnel.  He further alleged
that the delay in the transmittal of the records on account of some allegedly
missing transcripts was due to the laxity and dereliction of the court
personnel in handling said records.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 25, 1990, the trial court denied the motion for
reconsideration.  It observed that
despite her promise "to give whatever assistance [was needed] in
reconstituting some missing papers," the plaintiff failed to live up to
her undertaking.  She and her counsel
also failed to show up at several conferences which the Court had scheduled,
namely, on August 24, 1989, then again on September 6, 1989, September 19,
1989, October 10, 1989, October 25, 1989, November 15, 1989, December 1, 1989
and January 5, 1990.  The trial court's
observations are quoted hereunder:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">"x x x.  On several
occasions, the Clerk in Charge has brought the record of this case to the
Appeal Section of the Office of the Clerk of this Court for transmittal to the
Court of Appeals but was refused acceptance because some transcripts of
stenographic notes are missing, and the Court of Appeals does not accept record
of cases on appeal that are incomplete.  These facts were brought to the attention of plaintiff and she
repeatedly undertook, thru counsel, to complete the records so that the same
may be accepted by the Court of Appeals and her appeal duly prosecuted.  To this very late date, plaintiff has failed
to live up to her undertakings.</p>

<p class="3Q">"Completing the record of a case that is being appealed should
be the concern of the appellant, because if the decision appealed from is not
disturbed, she stands to lose.  Plaintiff's inaction and complacency in the case at bar is
understandable, as she is in possession and enjoyment of the property subject
of the deed of sale and torrens title sought to be nullified in the case at
bar.  She would naturally be contented
in folding her arms and allow the record of this case to gather dust in this
Court and pray that the said record may eventually get lost, thereby negating
the decision adverse to her." (pp. 46-47, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Mateo's motion for reconsideration of this order was denied by
the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">on </span>May 28, 1990.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 31, 1990, Mateo filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> in the Court of Appeals, CA-G.R SP No. 22679, "Laura
Mateo, petitioner vs. Hon. Eutropio Migriño, Adela Mendoza, Cecilio Mendoza and
the Branch Sheriff, Branch 151, RTC, Pasig, Metro Manila" praying that the
respondents be restrained from enforcing the decision in Civil Case No. 21071
of Branch 151 of the RTC at Pasig, Metro Manila; that the orders dated June 19,
1989, January 25, 1990 and May 28, 1990 of respondent Judge be annulled, and
that he be ordered to elevate the records of said Civil Case No. 21071 together
with all the evidence, both oral and documentary, for review by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 8, 1990, a decision was rendered by the Court of
Appeals, Tenth Division,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a>
dismissing the petition.  The Appellate
Court held:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">"On the facts of this case, the petitioner may be viewed as
having abandoned her appeal.  She had
appealed the respondent Court's decision on October 28, 1983, and had failed to
prosecute her appeal until the private respondents, to protect their own
interest, were compelled to file their motion to disallow appeal of April 10,
1989, a period of almost 6 years during which, the appeal had lain <i>frozen</i>
and forgotten.  The petitioner blames
the Clerk of Court for this delay, but it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is
</span>a hollow contention as shown in the text of the contested order above
quoted.  The peti­tioner's advertence to
the lack of competence on the part of the respondent Court has an empty
ring.  In situations involving shorter
period of time, the Highest Court of the land had unmistakably spoken and
expressed condemnation of such delays.  It had also made clear that the responsibility for the tr<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">ansmit</span>tal of records to the appellate
court, in other words, the responsi­bility for making the appeal move, belongs
to the appealing party and cannot be passed off to the Clerk of Court."
(p. 77, Rollo.)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals cited the following ruling of this Court in
Arcega, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 166 SCRA 773, 776: </p>

<p class="3Q">"x <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x.  </span>It cannot be said that the respondent
Court of Appeals abused its discretion or exceeded its jurisdiction in
dismissing the appeal of the petitioners for failure to prosecute, since it
appears that the petitioners did nothing to effect or facilitate the
transmittal of the records of the case to the appellate court for almost two
(2) years from the issuance of the order to elevate said records to the
appellate court.  The Court has held
that, while it is the duty of the clerk of the lower court to transmit the
records of an appealed case to the appellate court, it is also the duty of the
appellant to make the clerk of court act, and the failure of the clerk to
perform his legal duty is no justification for the appellant's failure to
perform his, and he cannot justify his failure by saying that the fault <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>that of the clerk of the lower
court."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals recalled that in Fagtanac, et al. vs. Court
of Appeals, et al., 22 SCRA 1227, 1234, we similarly ruled:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">"The negligence of private respondents in prosecuting their
appeals in these cases is palpably clear.  Their failure to assist the courts of justice to dispose of these cases
with reasonable dispatch is a sufficient reason to take away from them their
right to have the alleged errors in the appealed judgment corrected.  They delayed the administration of justice
by their delay in prosecuting their appeals.  And this, in spite of the fact that the civil suit was commenced on June
5, 1951, and the land registration case, on September 14, 1951.  In this situation, the spirit of the Rules
of Court forbids that efficacy of the administration of justice be shackled by
appellants' failure to prosecute the appeals.  The rule in this respect is to be held rigid.  Failure of an appellant to so prosecute must be reckoned against
him.  It would be a travesty in the
administration of justice if we are to order now the return of the records <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">to </span>the lower court just to complete
the records on appeal; to procure approval of the amended record still to be
presented by private respondents in the land registration case; and thereafter
to elevate the cases once again to the appellate court for resolution of the
appeals.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">"Delays in litigation have always been a bane in our judicial
system.  And we have observed a growing
tendency <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>defeated suitors and
their lawyers to disregard their duties under the Rules of Court, in the hope
that they may stall the final day of reckoning.  These are the considerations that now impel this Court to make a
policy state­ment that failure to prosecute wilI not be countenanced."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reversible error in the decision of the Court of
Appeals.  Indeed, while the transmittal
of the records of an appealed case to the appellate court is the duty of the
clerk of court of the trial court (Sec. 6, Rule 40, Rules of Court), for the
simple reason that said court employee is the custodian of those records and is
responsible for their safety and integrity, the speedy prosecution of the
appeal is principally the responsibility of the appellant, rather than of the
personnel of the trial court.  It is the
appellant, not the trial court, that is presumed to be interested in the review
and reversal of the latter's decision.  It is presumed that the appellant desires <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>speedy resolution of his appeal and
swift rectification of the errors in the appealed decision.  It behooves the appellant to be vigilant for
the protection of his right.  He should
take it upon himself to call the attention of the trial court to any delay in
the transmittal of the records of his case.  As we said in Estela vs. CA, 185 SCRA 732, 738:</p>

<p class="3Q">"We cannot subscribe to peti­tioner's gratuitous statement
that ‘as the rule now exists, the appel­lant is justified if he merely ‘folds
his hands’ after the trial judge has ordered that the records of the case be
transmitted to the appellate court.’</p>

<p class="3Q">"Conceding to the point that is the clerk of court who is
primarily responsible for seeing to it that the records of appealed cases are
properly sent to the appellate court without delay (and having failed to do so
subjects him to administrative liability), it behooves the litigants to be more
vigilant of their rights.  They should
take it upon themselves to call the attention of the trial court as to any
delay in action over their cases."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, if the appellant does nothing to press his appeal, it may
safely be concluded that he believes the judgment of the trial court to be
correct and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span>appeal aims to
accomplish nothing more than mere delay in the execution of the adverse
judgment, certainly unfair to the appellee who is denied the enjoyment of the
fruits of his victory in the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>long
as the appeal is not resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the records of this case, it is perfectly clear that such
was the purpose sought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>be
achieved by the petitioner's six-year delay in prosecuting her appeal.  The trial court correctly disallowed her
appeal and the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in affirming the
action of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule, that the trial court loses jurisdiction over a
case after the perfection of the appeal<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
hence, a motion to dismiss the appeal should be filed in the appellate court,
not in the trial court, presupposes that the record on appeal had been transmit­ted
to the appellate court.  In this case,
however, the motion to dismiss the appeal or to declare it abandoned, was not,
and could not, be filed in the Court of Appeals because there was no record on
appeal in the appellate court to speak of, Mateo's "appeal" was not
docketed there.  The records were still
in the trial court.  And even assuming
that Mateo's appeal was perfected upon the filing of her notice of appeal, the
trial court was not entirely divested of jurisdiction over the case.  Under Section 9, Rule 41 Rules of Court, it
retained jurisdiction "to issue orders for the protection and preservation
of the rights of the parties <u>prior</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>transmittal</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>record</u> <u>on</u> <u>appeal</u> to the appellate
court." The Court of Appeals’ affirmance of the trial court's order
declaring the appeal abandoned, cured whatever defect there might have been on
the trial court's jurisdiction to act on the appellees' motion to dismiss the
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for review is DENIED for lack of

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PADILLA, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion has denied the petition for review in this
case, which seeks to annul the decision of the Court of Appeals, thus,
upholding the dismissal by the Regional Trial Court Branch 151 Pasig of herein petitioner's
appeal from the decision in Civil Case No. 21071.</p>

<p class="BODY">The denial is based on a finding that there was no reversible
error committed by the Court of Appeals in applying the cases of <u>Arcega v.
The Honorable Court of Appeals</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and <u>Fagnatac, et. al. v. Court Of Appeals</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and holding that there was failure to prosecute the appeal and that the appeal
"aims to accomplish nothing more than mere delay."</p>

<p class="BODY">I regret I cannot join the majority notwithstanding my being the <u>ponente</u>
in the <u>Arcega</u> case, for reasons to be stated and discussed hereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Arcega</u>, it will be recalled, the appeal was dismissed
by the appellate court not by the trial court.  The same is true in <u>Fagnatac</u> where the Court of Appeals was
directed by this Court to dismiss the appeals taken upon a finding that there
was failure to prosecute.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>Aguirre v. CFI of Leyte</u>, <u>Branch III</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled in language that can well apply to the case at bar, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent trial court acted without juris­diction when it
ordered the dismissal of the appeal for failure to prosecute, the proper court
to order the dismissal of the appeal for failure to prosecute, after the
perfection of said appeal, being the Court of Appeals, before which the appeal
is taken."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Heirs of Gavino Sabanal v. Gorospe, et al</u>.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court pointedly held "that it is not within the province of the lower
court to determine at that stage of the proceedings whether an appeal is
frivolous or not.  Such duty devolves
upon the appellate courts."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it is my considered view that the admitted
filing of the notice of appeal and the expiration of the reglementary period of
fifteen (15) days for filing the same, <u>perfected</u> <u>the</u> <u>appeal</u>
from the trial court.  The trial court
therefore lost jurisdiction over the case "except to issue orders for the
protection and preservation of the rights of the parties which do not involve
any matter litigated by the appeal x x x."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In <u>Aguirre</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"The<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>order granting
private respondent's motion to dismiss appeal for failure of petition­ers to
prosecute their appeal is not merely an order for the protection of the rights
of the parties but is an order which disposes of the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that whether the dismissal is based on a finding
that the appeal is frivolous and dilatory or on failure to prosecute the
appeal, the court with jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal is the appellate
court and not the trial court as, in my opinion, erroneously held by the
majority.  To stress the point further,
the venerable Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes in the case of <u>Repubic v. Rodriguez</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
had occasion to emphasize that:</p>

<blockquote>"Sections 13 and 14 of Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court
clearly establish that, unless the appeal is abandoned, the only ground for
dismissing an appeal in the trial court is the failure of the appellant to file
on time the notice of appeal, appeal bond or record on appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Section 39 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 and
its Implementing Rules and Guidelines modified this by requiring a record on
appeal only in certain cases and eliminating the appeal bond.  Thus, applying the rule in <u>Dosalla v.
Caluag</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the appeal having been perfected by the filing of the notice of appeal and the
expiration of the fifteen (15) day period to appeal it became the duty of the
trial court to give due course to the appeal.  The soundness of this rule is supported by Section 1 paragraph (c), Rule
50 of the Revised Rules of Court which provides for the following as one of the
grounds for dismissal of an appeal by the Court of Appeals, <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u>
or upon motion of the appellee, namely:  appellant's failure to prosecute his appeal under Section 3 of Rule 46.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the trial court in the case at bar acted without
jurisdiction in granting the motion to dismiss (disallow) the appeal, such
order is plainly null and void and can have no force or effect whatsoever.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now examine whether there was failure to prosecute the appeal
on the part of the defendant (herein petitioner).</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied that it was only on 16 January 1986, or more
than two (2) years from the filing of the notice of appeal that the trial court
ordered the Clerk of Court to forward the records of the case to the
Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of Appeals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Absent any showing that petitioner refused to supply the supposedly missing
documents or papers to complete the record, there cannot be a finding of
failure to prosecute.  The case of <u>Estela
v. CA</u>, cited by the majority,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
should be distinguished from the case at bar for in the former not only was it
the Court of Appeals which dismissed the appeal but more importantly there was
a finding of "gross inaction for a period which exceeded one year" on
the part of the appellant.  Certainly
such gross inaction cannot be attributed to herein petitioner who had
undertaken, through counsel, to complete the records of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The inability to complete the records of the case should not deprive the
appellant of his chance and statutory right to appeal, specially in the case at
bar where the missing documents are transcripts of stenographic notes which are
under the care and custody of court personnel and the ultimate control of the
trial court.  Otherwise, not only will
there arise occasions for trial courts to delay or prevent review or reversal
of their decisions by appellate courts but the conditions would be ripe for
unscrupulous and/or corrupt court personnel to frustrate the ends of justice by
preventing the completion of the case records (like stenographic notes) and, in
the process making it appear that there is failure to prosecute on the part of
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, vote to GRANT the petition.  Petitioner's appeal should be REINSTATED.<span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
