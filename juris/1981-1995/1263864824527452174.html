falsification of public document through reckless imprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He points to the personnel officer, <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> <span class="SpellE">Salic</span>, or the latter's
subordinates, as responsible for the erasures and alterations in said
appointment paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He likewise asserts
that Director <span class="SpellE">Kundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahm</span>
should also be held responsible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
support of this assertion, he quotes a portion of the cross-examination of
witness <span class="SpellE">Pahm</span>, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner thus claims
that the appointment paper (Exhibit "C") already bore the erasures,
alterations and intercalations even before <span class="SpellE">Pahm</span>
signed it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner also contends
that the following elements of the crime charged under paragraph 4, Article
171, of the Revised Penal Code, are absent in the case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. The offender makes in a document false statement in a narration
of facts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. He has a legal obligation to disclose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the truth of the facts narrated by him;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The person making the narration of facts must be aware of the
falsity of the facts narrated by him.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner submits that
he is not a public officer who is in charge of preparing appointments of the
employees in</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the agency; that he had no participation or
intervention in the preparation of his appointment paper nor held it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">custody in an official capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, petitioner argues that granting, for the sake of argument, but
not admitting, that he did falsify the questioned document, no third person had
been damaged thereby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also points out
that the alleged falsified document bears the correct item number and
appropriate civil service eligibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, there is no falsification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He cites the case of <u>U.S. </u></span><u>vs. <span class="SpellE">Lino</span>
Reyes</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in which:</span></p>

<blockquote>"It was ruled that there can be no con­viction for
falsification of a public document in the absence of proof that the defendant
maliciously perverted the truth with wrongful intent<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner invokes good faith in his defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims that after the personnel officer
handed him the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">questioned document,
which bore the erasures and alterations as well as the Director's signature, he
brought it to the Civil Service Commission in Manila upon suggestion and with
the permission of the personnel officer.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petition is without
merit.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The core of petitioner's
arguments is based on the testimony of witness <span class="SpellE">Kundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahm</span>, earlier quoted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner makes capital of the testimony of </span>Director <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pahm</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> that the latter signed Exhibit "C"
even if he already noticed the mistake in the stated eligibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, an analysis and examination of </span>the
same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">testimony and that of witness <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> <span class="SpellE">Salic</span>, the personnel
officer, would show that Exhibit "C" was precisely discarded or cancelled
after Director <span class="SpellE">Pahm</span> had inadvertently signed it
before noticing the mistake in the entry on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

eligibility </span><u>only</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, petitioner's citation of
the testimonies of both <span class="SpellE">Kundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahm</span>
</span>and <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> <span class="SpellE">Salic</span>
disproves his contention that both officers are to be blamed for the
falsification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both officers
categorically stated that Exhibit "C" was replaced by another
appointment paper (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B") which was duly
approved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>the CSC Regional
Office in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that Exhibit "C" was
the cancelled appointment paper that was missing but later found in the
possession of petitioner already bearing erasures, alterations and
superimpositions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consider the following
testimonies:</p>

authorize him (<span class="SpellE">Sarep</span></span>)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, he knew that
if the falsified document had been presented before the CSC Regional Office, it
would have surely been attested </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">temporary only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he purposely avoided filing the appointment
paper with the CSC Regional Office, which is the practice and standard
procedure in the regional office of the Bureau of Soils and, instead,
personally brought it to Manila where somehow he was able to have it </span>stamped
approved as permanent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court also rejects <span class="SpellE">Sarep's</span> argument that there is no falsification, as the
alleged falsified document bears the correct item number and appropriate
eligibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
respondent court that "(I)t is falsification, and not a correction, which
the law punishes (People vs. Mateo, 25 Phil. 324; <span class="SpellE">Arriola</span>

public or official </span>documents, whether by public officials or by private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">persons, it is not necessary that there be
present the idea of gain or the intent to injure a third person, for the reason
that, in contradiction to private documents, the principal thing </span>p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unished is the violation of the public faith
and the destruction of the truth as therein solemnly proclaimed (Decision of

the benefit of the circumstance that he did not maliciously pervert the truth
with the wrongful intent of injuring some person (People vs. Reyes, 1 Phil.
341).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since he sincerely believed that
his CSC eligibility based on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">his </span>having
passed the Regional Cultural Community Officer (Unassembled) Examination <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">and </span>educational attainment were
sufficient to qualify <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">him for a </span>permanent
position, then he should only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be held
liable for falsification through reckless imprudence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Leopando</span>, 36 O.G. 2937, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Maleza</span>,
14 Phil. 468; People vs. Pacheco, 18 Phil. 399).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, which punishes
criminal negligence or quasi-offenses, furnishes the middle way between a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> wrongful act </span>committed with wrongful
intent, which gives rise to a felony, and a wrongful act committed without any
intent which may entirely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">exempt the
doer from criminal liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the
duty of everyone to execute his own acts with due care and diligence in order
that no prejudicial or injurious results may be suffered by others from acts
that are otherwise offensive (<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, R.P.C. Vol.
III, 1976, Ed., p. 1884).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is
penalized is the mental attitude or condition behind the acts of dangerous
recklessness and lack of care or foresight although such mental attitude might
have produced several effects or consequences (People vs. Cano, L-19660, </span>May
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">24, 1966).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consequently, the penalty to be imposed upon the accused
herein should be that as provided for in the first paragraph of Article 365 of
the Revised Penal Code, which is the penalty prescribed for any person who by
reck­less imprudence, shall commit any act which, had it been intentional,
would constitute a grave <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">felony, to
