				<H3>MANUEL CO KENG KIAN, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT (FOURTH SPECIAL CASES DIVISION) AND PLAZA ARCADE, INC., RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The legal issue raised in this petition is whether the notice to
vacate required to be served on the lessee under Section 2, Rule 70 of the
Revised Rules of Court in order to confer jurisdiction on the Metropolitan
Trial Court in an action <span style="">for </span><span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, may be served by registered mail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 23, 1982, a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
against petitioner Manuel Co <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> <span class="SpellE">Kian</span>
was filed by private respondent Plaza Arcade, Inc., alleging that despite the
expiration of the written contract of lease over a portion of the ground floor
of the former Manila Times Building, petitioner refused to vacate the premises
and to pay the monthly rentals notwithstanding receipt of several letters of
demand, the last of which was <span style="">sent </span>to
petitioner by registered mail.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the trial before
the Metro<span style="">politan </span>Trial Court of
Manila or on <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1982</st1:date>,
petitioner voluntarily vacated the disputed premises, turning over the key to
the clerk of court but without paying the accrued rent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1984</st1:date>,
the inferior court rendered its judgment <b style="">dismissing</b><span style=""> </span>the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
refused to give probative value to the three letters of demand to vacate which
were all sent to petitioner and which he refused to receive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court held that since none of the demand
letters <span style="">was served (1) personally, or
(2) by written notice of such demand upon a person found on the premises, or
(3) by posting such notice on the premises if no person can be found thereon
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, there
was no valid demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If none was made,
the case came within the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court and not </span>the
Metropolitan Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, it
ordered Plaza Arcade, Inc. to pay petitioner P5,000.00 as attorney's fees and
another P5,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaza Arcade, Inc. appealed to the Regional Trial Court which
initially reversed the decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court, but on motion
for reconsideration by petitioner, <b style="">affirmed</b><span style=""> </span>the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case in its order of <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1985</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A petition for review was filed with the then Intermediate
Appellate Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision dated <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1986</st1:date> the Appellate Court <b style="">overturned</b><span style=""> </span>the appealed order of the trial court which had earlier sustained
the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cas<span style="">e.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Motion
for reconsideration having been denied, the aforesaid decision of the Appellate
Court was elevated to this Court on a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reversing the dismissal order, the Appellate Court took the
lower courts to task for taking a rather constricted view of Section 2, Rule
70, and declaring that the service of demand letters to vacate on the lessee is
strictly limited to the three (3) modes enumerated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They failed to note the common practice of
serving said notices on the tenant by registered mail with return card so that
the registry receipt and the receipt thereof by the addressee through the
return card could be presented in evidence to prove the fact of delivery, in
the event of a litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree and in our opinion the facts in the instant case
indicate personal service on the lessee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In arriving at this conclusion, we have been greatly aided by
respondent's citation of American cases which, by and large, represents a
practical, if not realistic, approach to the problem.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Nunlist</u></span> <u>vs.</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Motter</span></u></span><u><span style="">,</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and <span class="SpellE"><u>Gehring</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Swoll</u></span><u>,</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held that where the notice to leave the prem­ises is transmitted by
registered mail with a return card and thereafter the receipt bearing the
signature of the defendant wa<span style="">s </span>returned,
a prima facie case is established of the fact of delivery of said notice to the
defendant personally by the Postal Office Department although he refused to
accept the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, notice by registered mail is considered an effective
service on the person concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be avoided by the mere expediency of declining to accept delivery after
notification thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The service is
deemed complete regardless of such refusal to accept if the addressee fails to
claim his mail from the postal office after the lapse of five (5) days from the
date of the first notice of the postmaster.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In conclusion, we stress that the notice to vacate the leased
premises, required by the Rules to be served on the tenant before a forcible
entry or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> action can be com­menced
against him, may be served by registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a substantial compliance with the modes of service enumerated
under Section 2, Rule 70 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture it bears repeating that actions for forcible
entry and unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> are summary in nature
because they involve <span style="">a </span>disturbance
of social order which must be abated as promptly as possible without any undue
reliance on technical and procedural rules which only cause delays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the ultimate analysis, it matters not how
the notice to vacate was conveyed, so long <span style="">as </span>the lessee or his agent has personally received the <span style="">written demand, whether handed to him by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, his attor</span>ney, a messenger or even a
postman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The undisputed facts in the
instant case show that the Manila Times Publishing Company, through its
manager, had informed petitioner that Plaza Arcade Inc. was the new owner of
the subject building; that on October 18, 1979, a demand letter was sent to
petitioner advising him to leave the premises but petitioner refused to receive
the letter; that a second demand on January 12, 1981 elicited the same
reaction; that a final demand dated November 16, 1981 was sent to petitioner by
registered mail which he again refused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And even on the supposition that there was no personal service as
claimed by petitioner, this could only be due to petitioner’s <span style="">blatant attempts at evasion which compelled
the new landlord to resort </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court cannot countenance an unfair
situation where the plaintiff in an eviction case suffers further injustice by
the unwarranted delay resulting from the obstinate refusal of the defendant to
acknowledge the existence of a valid demand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the petition is denied for lack of merit and the assailed
decision of the Court of Appeals reversing the dismissal <span style="">order of </span><span style="">the trial court is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. </span><span style="">071279-CV </span>is hereby ordered reinstated in the Metropolitan Trial
Court of Manila, Branch 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision
