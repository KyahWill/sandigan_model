<p class="BODY">On August 21, 1989, the First Division of this Court issued a Resolution<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
requiring the parties to manifest whether they are still interested in
prosecuting the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 16, 1989, private respondents' counsel manifested that
he is still interested in the early resolution of this case without which his
Motion to enforce the attorneys lien dated December 28, 1985 would be without
basis and that private respondents were only forced to accept the amounts
offered by the petitioner due to the delay in the resolution of this case since
they could no longer endure and sustain a long litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition alleging grave abuse of discretion on the
part of the public respondent NLRC in finding that private respondents are
employees of the petitioner considering that she is only a lessor of "Sa
Kabukiran Restaurant" since said restaurant was leased to Eddie Daguinotan
from April, 1978 to November, 1978; to Elaine Asejo from January, 1979 to
December, 1979; to Gilda Montilla from the middle of January, 1980 to July,
1980; and to Alice Araneta from February, 1981 up to the time when this case
was set for hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with petitioner's allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that in determining the existence of an
employer-employee relationship, the elements that are generally considered are
the following:  (a) the manner of
selection and engagement of the putative employee; (b) the mode of payment of
wages; (c) the presence or absence of the power of dismissal; and (d) the
presence or absence of a power to control the putative employee's conduct.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had generally relied on the so-called right-of-control
test where the person for whom the services are performed reserves a right to
control not only the end achieved but also the means to be used in reaching
such end.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, petitioner's contention that private respondents are not
her employees since she was merely a lessor of the restaurant and had acted
only in a representative capacity for her different lessees is not
meritorious.  As held by the Labor
Arbiter in its Order:</p>

<blockquote>"A similar conclusion could also be made as regards the
testimonies given by Eddie Daguinotan and Alice Araneta, both alleged to be
lessees of the property during the period covered by the complaint.  There is no dispute that both had been
employees of respondent Enieda Montilla (herein petitioner).  Relative to their declarations, it would not
be amiss to state that the same were made more in deference to the wishes of
respondent Enieda Montilla, their employer.  The fact is that Alice Araneta, for instance, is still an employee of Sa
Kabukiran Restaurant.  It would be more
logical to believe, instead, the testimonies made by Jose Javelosa,
respondent's (petitioner's) former promoter and PRO manager, no longer having
any connection at all with any of the litigants.  He consistently averred that Eddie Daguinotan was hired as a cook
of Sa Kabukiran Restaurant and was, in fact, under his supervision at the said
restaurant.  The various documents shown
by respondent (Exhibits "1", "1-A", "1-B" and
"2") are not absolute proof of ownership.  Precisely, the same are contested by complainants (herein private
respondents) as the same are alleged to be a scheme adopted by respondent
Enieda Montilla (herein petitioner) to evade her responsibilities under the
law.  Exhibit "C" for the
complainants (herein private respondents), [which is a] Pacific Banking
Corporation Interbank/Master Charge Merchant Agreement, acknowledged before a
notary public on March 21, 1979 is very material to the issue.  It shows respondent Enieda Montilla (herein
petitioner) signing the agreement as authorized representative of Sa Kabukiran
Restaurant.  How can she now claim to
have nothing to do with the restaurant's operations except as lessor
thereof?"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, private respondents' testimonies that Gilda Montilla,
proprietor/manager of Sa Kabukiran Restaurant, paid their Social Security
System premium contributions adds strength to the conclusion that the latter
are considered employees of the restaurant.  Indeed, private respondents are employees of petitioner's restaurant.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the fact that private respondents entered into a
compromise agreement in connection with the complaints they filed against
petitioner and executed af<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">f</span>idavits
of waiver in full settlement of the judgment in the NLRC case, amounts to a
valid and binding compromise agreement.  As we held in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Periquet vs. NLRC</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúNot all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against public
policy.  If the agreement was
voluntarily entered into and represents a reasonable settlement, it is binding
on the parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of
mind.  It is only where there is clear
proof that the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person, or
the terms of settlement are unconscionable on its face, that the law will step
in to annul the questionable transaction.  But where it is shown that the person making the waiver did so
voluntarily, with full understanding of what he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>doing, and the consideration for
the quitclaim is credible and reasonable, the transaction must be recognized as
a valid and binding undertaking.  As in
this case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the Motion filed by the private respondents'
counsel praying that the Court order petitioner to pay 10% of the total award
granted to the private respondents as his attorney's lien under the authority
of Rule VIII, Section 11 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, we
hold that no such attorney's lien could be enforced.</p>

<p class="BODY">A charging lien to be enforceable as security for the payment of
attorney's fees requires as a condition <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">sine qua non</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

pursuance of such judgment.  A lawyer

<p class="BODY">The attorney's lien can be enforced in the same action if his
client is awarded a certain sum by the Court.  Only in cases where no amount is awarded to his client will the filing of
an appropriate action be necessary.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>
