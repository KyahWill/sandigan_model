				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a murder case where the accused interposed as a defense
the exempting circumstance of insanity.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that at about two o'clock in the after­noon of
September 8, 1970, Ernesto Puno, 28, a jeepney driver, entered a bedroom in the
house of Francisca Col (Aling Kikay), 72, a widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was located in the area known as
Little Baguio, Barrio Tinajeros, Malabon, Rizal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On seeing Aling Kikay sitting in bed, Puno insulted her by
saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mangkukulam ka,
mambabarang, mayroon kang bubuyog".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, he repeatedly slapped her and struck her several times on the head
with a hammer until she was dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assault was witnessed by Hilaria de la Cruz, 23, who was in
the bedroom with the old woman, and by Lina Pajes, 27, a tenant of the
adjoining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They testified that
Puno's eyes were reddish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His look was
baleful and menacing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Puno was a
neighbor of Aling Kikay.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the killing, Puno went to the room of Lina, where Hilaria
had taken refuge, and, according to Hilaria, he made the following confession
and threat:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Huag kayong
magkakamaling <span style="">tumawag ng pulis at
sabihin ninyo na umalis kayo ng bahay at hindi ninyo alam kung sino ang pumatay
sa matanda." Or, according to Lina, Puno said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pinatay ko na iyong matanda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huag kayong tumawag ng pulis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pag tumawag kayo ng pulis, kayo ang
paghihigantihan ko."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the killing, Puno fled to his parents' house at Barrio
Tugatog, Malabon and then went to the house of his second cousin, Teotimo Puno,
located at Barrio San Jose, Calumpit, <span style="">Bulacan,
reaching that place in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
he was able to go to that place, which was then flooded, is not shown in the
record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Disregarding Puno's threat, Una, after noting that he had left,
notified the Malabon police of the killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Corporal Daniel B. Cruz answered the call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found Aling Kikay sprawled on her bed
already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her head was bloody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her blanket and pillows were bloodstained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took down the statements <span style="">of </span>Lina and Hilaria at the police
station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They pointed to Puno as the
killer (pp. 15-17, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">A medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investi­gation
conducted an autopsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He certified that
the victim <span style="">had </span>lacerated wounds
on her right eyebrow and contusions on the head caused by a hard
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On opening the skull, the
doctor found extensive and generalized hemorrhage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death was intracranial,
traumatic hemorrhage (Exh. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">Puno's father surrendered him to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two Mala­bon policemen brought him to the
National Mental Hospital in Mandaluyong, Rizal on September 10, 1970 (p. 14,
Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was charged with murder in
the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He waived the
second stage of the preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 21, 1970, he was indicted for murder in the Circuit
Criminal Court at Pasig, Rizal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleged
in the inform­ation as aggravating circumstances were evident premeditation,
abuse of superiority and disregard of sex.</p>

<p class="BODY">Puno, a native of Macabebe, Pampanga, who testified about five
months after the killing, pretended that he did not remember having killed Aling
Kikay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He believes that there are
persons who are "mangkukulam", “mambabarang" and
"mambubuyog" and that when one is victimized by those persons, his
feet might shrink or his hands might swell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Puno believes that a person harmed by a "mambabarang" might
have a headache or a swelling nose and ears and can be cured only by a quack
doctor (<u>herbolaryo</u>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, it <span style="">is </span>necessary
to kill the "mang­kukulam" and “mambabarang''.</p>

<p class="BODY">Puno is the third child in a family of twelve children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is married with two children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He finished third year high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father is a welder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among his friends are drivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exh. B).</p>

<p class="BODY">Zenaida Gabriel, 30, Puno's wife, testified that on the night
before the murder, Puno's eyes were reddish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He complained of a headache. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
following day while he was feeding the pigs, he told Zenaida that a bumble bee
was coming towards him and he warded it off with <span style="">his </span>hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Zenaida did
not see any bee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Puno then went upstairs and took the cord of the religious habit
of his mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted to use that
cord in tying his dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked for
another rope when Zenaida admonished him not to use that cord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Puno tied the dog to a tree by looping the
rope through its mouth and over its head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He repeatedly boxed the dog.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aida Gabriel, <span style="">Zenaida's
elder </span>sister, saw Puno while he was boxing that dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aida observed that Puno's eyes were bloodshot
and his countenance had a ferocious expression.</p>

<p class="BODY">Teotimo Puno testified that on the night of September 8, 1970,
Ernesto Puno came to their house in Barrio San Jose, Calumpit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto was soaking wet as there was a flood
in that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was cuddling a puppy
that he called "Diablo".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
called for Teotimo's mother who invited him to eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto did not eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he fed the puppy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ernesto introduced
Teotimo to his puppy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he </span>sang
an English song.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Teotimo asked him
to change his wet clothes, Ernesto refused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, he tried on the clothes of Teotimo's father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When told that Teotimo's father had been dead
for a couple of years already, Ernesto just looked at Teotimo.</p>

<p class="BODY">While he was lying down, Ernesto began singing again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he emitted a moaning sound until he fell
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto was awakened the next
morning by the noise caused by persons wading in the flood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto thought they were his fellow <u>cursillistas.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented three psychiatrists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of proving that Puno was
insane when he killed Aling Kikay, the medical experts testified that Puno
acted with discernment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, Doctor Araceli
Maravilla of the Psychiatry Section of the Dr. Jose R. Reyes Memorial Hospital,
to whom Puno was referred for treatment ten times between September 8, 1966 and
</span>July 24, 1970, testified that Puno was an out-patient who could very
well live with society, although he was afflicted with <span style="">"schizophrenic reaction"; that Puno knew what he was doing
and that he had psychosis, a slight destruction of the ego.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Puno admitted to Doctor Maravilla that one
cause of his rest­lessness, sleeplessness and irritability was his financial
prob­lem (7 tsn November 4, 1970).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Doctor Maravilla observed that Puno on July 24, 1970 was already cured.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Doctor Reynaldo Robles of the National Mental Hospital testified
that Puno was first brought to that hospital on July 28, 1962 because his
parents complained that he laughed alone and exhibited certain eccentricities
such as kneeling, praying and<span style=""> making
his body rigid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doctor Robles observed
that while Puno was suffering from "schizophrenic reaction", his
symptoms were "not socially incapacitating" and that he could adjust
him­self to his environment (4 tsn January 20, 1971).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He agreed with Doctor Maravilla's testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Doctor Carlos Vicente, a medical specialist of the National
Mental Hospital, testified that from his examination of Puno, he gathered that
Puno acted with discernment when he committed the killing and that Puno could
distinguish between right and wrong (5 tsn January 11, 1971).</p>

<p class="BODY">Doctor Vicente also concluded that Puno was not suffering from
any delusion and that he was not mentally deficient; otherwise, he would not
have reached third year high school (8-19 tsn January 11, 1971).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1970 or three months after the com­mission of the
offense, Doctors Vicente, Robles and Victorina V. Manikan of the National
Mental Hospital submitted the follow­ing report on Puno (Exh. B or 2):</p>

<blockquote>"Records show that he had undergone psychiatric treat­ment at
the Out-Patient Service of the National Mental Hospital for schizophrenia in
1962 from which he recovered; in 1964 a relapse of the same mental illness when
he improved and in 1966 when his illness remained unimproved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"His treatment was continued at the JRR Memorial Hospital at
the San Lazaro Compound up to July, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was relieved of symptoms and did not come back anymore for
medication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 8, 1970,
according to inform­ation, he was able to kill an old woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Particulars of the offense are not given.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"MENTAL
CONDITION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x </span>x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presently, he is quiet and as usual manage­able.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is fairly clean in person and without
undue display of emotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He talks to
co-patients but becomes evasive when talking with the doctor and other
personnel of the ward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knows he is
accused of murder but refuses to elaborate on it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"REMARKS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing findings, Ernesto Puno, who
previously was suffering from a mental illness called schizo­phrenia, <u>is
presently free from any social incapacitating psychotic symptoms.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The seeming ignorance of very simple known facts and amnesia
of several isolated accounts in his life do not fit the active pattern of a
schizophrenic process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be found
in an acutely disturbed and confused patient or a markedly re­tarded individual
of which he is not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, persons who recover from an acute episode of mental
illness like schizophrenia may retain some residual symptoms impairing their
judgment but <u>not necessarily their discernment of right from wrong of the
offense committed."<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing report was submitted pursuant to Rule 28 of the
Rules of Court and the order of the trial court dated Novem­ber 16, 1970 for
the mental examination of Puno in the National Mental Hospital to determine
whether he could stand trial and whether he was sane when he committed the
killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court concluded that Puno was sane or knew that the
killing of Francisca Col was wrong and that he would be punished for it, as
shown by the threats which he made to Hilaria de la Cruz and Lina Pajes, the
old woman's companions who witnessed his dastardly deed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court also concluded that if Puno was a homi­cidal
maniac who had gone berserk, he would have killed also Hilaria and Lina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he singled out Aling Kikay sig­nified
that he really disposed of her because he thought that she was a witch.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Onofre A. Villaluz said that during the trial he
"meticulously observed the conduct and behavior of the accused inside the
court, most especially when he was presented on the witness stand” and he was
convinced "that the accused is sane and has full grasp of what was
happening" in his environment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court convicted Puno of murder, sentenced him to death
and ordered him to pay the heirs of the victim an indemnity of twenty-two
thousand pesos (Criminal Case No. 509).</p>

<p class="BODY">His counsel <u>de</u> <u><span style="">oficio</span></u>
in this review of the death sentence, contends that the trial court erred in
not sustaining the defense of insanity and in appreciating evident
premeditation, abuse of superiority and disregard <span style="">of sex </span>as aggravating circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">When insanity is alleged as a ground for exemption from
responsibility, the evidence on this point must refer to the time preceding the
act under prosecution or to the very moment of its execution (U.S. vs. Guevara,
27 Phil. 547).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insanity should be proven
by clear and positive evidence (People vs. Bascos, 44 Phil. 204).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense contends that Puno was insane when he killed
Francisca Col because he had chronic schizophrenia since 1962; he was suffering
from schizophrenia on September 8, 1970, when he liquidated the victim, and
schizophrenia is a form of psychosis which deprives a person of discernment and
free<span style="">dom of will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Insanity under article 12 of the Revised Penal Code means that
the accused must be deprived completely of reason or discernment and freedom of
the will at the time of committing <span style="">the
crime (People vs. Formigones, 87 Phil. 658, 660).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"Insanity exists when there is <u>complete</u> deprivation
of intelligence in committing the act, that is, the accused is dep­rived of
reason, he acts without the least discernment because there is <u>complete</u>
absence of the power to discern, or that there is <u>total deprivation of
freedom of the will</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere
abnormality of the mental faculties will not exclude imputability."
(People vs. Ambal, G.R. No. 52688, October 17, 1980; People vs. Renegado,
L-27031, May 31, 1974, 57 SCRA 275, 286; People vs. Cruz, 109 Phil. 288,
292.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to "el trastorno mental
transitorio" as an exempting circumstance, see 1 Cuello Calon, Codigo
Penal, 15th Ed., 1974, pp. 498-504 and art. 8 of the Spanish Penal Code.)</p>

<p class="BODY">After evaluating counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio's</u> contentions in
the light of the strict rule just stated and the circumstances sur­rounding the
killing, we are led to the conclusion that Puno was not legally insane when he
killed the hapless and helpless victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts and the findings of the psychiatrists reveal that on that
tragic occasion he was not completely deprived of reason and freedom of will.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. Fausto y Tomas, 113 Phil. 841, the ac­cused was
confined in the National Mental Hospital for thirteen days because he was
suffering from schizophrenia of the para­noid type.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His confinement was recommended by Doctor
Antonio Casal of the San Miguel Brewery where the accused used to work as a
laborer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About one year and two months
later, he killed Doctor Casal because the latter refused to certify him for re-­employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His plea of insanity was rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was con­victed of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the trial court correctly characterized the
killing as murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The qualifying
circumstance is abuse of superiority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
liquidating Francisca Col, Puno, who was armed with a hammer, took advantage of
his superior natural strength <span style="">over that
of the unarmed septuagenarian female victim who was unable to offer any
resistance and who could do nothing but exclaim "Diyos ko".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it was held that "an attack made by a man with a
deadly weapon upon an unarmed and defenseless woman consti­tutes the
circumstance of <span style="">abuse of<span style=""> </span>that superiority</span> which his
sex and the weapon used in the act afforded him and from which the woman was
unable to defend herself" (People vs. Guzman, 107 Phil. 1122, 1127 citing
U.S. vs. Consuelo, 13 Phil. 612; U.S. vs. Camiloy, 36 Phil. 757 and People vs.
Quesada, 62 Phil. 446).</p>

<p class="BODY">Evident premeditation (<u>premeditacion conocida</u>) cannot be
appreciated because the evidence does not show (a) the time when the offender
determined to commit the crime, (b) an act manifestly indicating that the
culprit had clung to his determi­nation and (c) a sufficient interval of time
between the deter­mination and the execution of the crime to allow him to
reflect upon the consequences of his act (People vs. Abletes, L-33304, July 31,
1974, 58 SCRA 241, 247).</p>

<p class="BODY">The essence of premeditation "es la mayor perversidad del
culpable juntamente con su serenidad o frialdad de animo".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is characterized (1) "por la
concepcion del delito y la reso­lucion de ejecutarlo firme„ fria, reflexiva,
meditada y dete<span style="">nida" and (2)
"por la persistencia en la resolucion de delin­quir demostrada por el
espacio de tiempo transcurrido entre dicha resolucion y la </span>ejecucion <span style="">del hecho".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Premeditation should be evident, meaning that
it should be shown by "signos reiterados y externos, no de meras
sospechas" (1 Cuello Calon, Codigo Penal, 1974 or 15th Ed., pp. 582-3).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dwelling and disregard of the respect due to the victim on
account of her old age should be appreciated as generic aggravating
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disregard of sex is not
aggravating because there <span style="">is </span>no evidence that the accused deliberately in<span style="">tended to offend or insult the sex of the
victim or showed mani­fest disrespect to her womanhood (People vs. Mangsant, 65
Phil. 548; People vs. Mori, L-23511-2, January 31, 1974, 55 SCRA 382, 404;
People vs. Jaula, 90 Phil. 379; U.S. vs. De Jesus, 14 Phil. 190).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, those two aggravating circumstances are off­set by the
mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender to the authorities and, as
contended by counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>, the offender' s mental illness
(mild psychosis or schizophrenic reaction) which diminished his will-power
without however depriving him of consciousness of his acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs. Francisco, 78 Phil. 694,
People vs. Amit, 82 Phil. 820 and People vs. Formigones, 87 Phil. 658.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it was held that "la equivocada creencia de los
acusados de que el matar a un brujo es un bien al publico puede considerarse
como una circunstancia atenuante pues los que tienen la obsesion de que los
brujos deben ser eliminados estan en la misma condicion que aquel que, atacado
de enfermedad morbosa, pero consciente aun de lo que hace, no tiene verdadero
imperio de su voluntad" (People vs. Balneg, 79 Phil. 805, 810).</p>

<p class="BODY">It results that the medium period of the penalty for murder
should be imposed (Arts. 64[4] and 248, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the death penalty is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused is sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity imposed by the trial court is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
should not be held liable for the crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was mentally ill when he committed the
alleged killing of Francisca Col (Aling Kikay), a 72-year old widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His </span>medical
records, as properly evaluated and confirmed by the<span style=""> expert testimony of the three physicians/psychiatrists who examined
and treated him, undeniably establish the fact that appellant had been ailing
with a psychotic disorder medically known as chronic schizophrenia of the
paranoid type.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Inevitably, WE must look into the nature of appellant's mental
disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Noye's Modern Clinical
Psychiatry, Seventh Edition, explains:</p>

<blockquote>"Symptomatically, the schizophrenic reactions are recognizable
through odd and bizarre behavior apparent in aloofness, suspiciousness, or
periods of impulsive destructiveness and immature and exaggerated emotionality,
often ambivalently directed and considered inappropriate by the observer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interpersonal perceptions are distorted

<p class="BODY">Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by
inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and often accompanied by
hallucinations and delusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Formerly
called dementia praecox, it is the most common form of psychosis and usually
develops between the ages of 15 and 30 (Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine
and Nursing, Miller-Keane, p. 860).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For a clear appreciation
of appellant's mental condition, quoted hereunder are pertinent portions of the
discussion on the paranoid type of schizophrenia:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><u>"Paranoid Types</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The features that tend to be most evident in this type or phase are
delusions, which are often numerous, illogical, and disregardful <span style="">of reality, hallucinations, and the usual
schizophrenic disturbance of associations and of affect, together with
negativism.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Frequently the prepsychotic personality of the paranoid
schizophrenic is characterized by poor interpersonal rapport.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Often he is cold, withdrawn, distrustful, and
resentful of other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many are
truculent, have a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude, and are argumentative,
scornful, sarcastic, defiant, resentful of suggestions or of authority, and given
to caustic remarks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Sometimes flippant,
facetious responses cover an underlying hostility.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The patient's
previous negative attitudes become more marked, and misinterpretations are
common.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ideas of reference are among the
first symptoms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disorders of association
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many <span style="">patients show an unpleasant emotional aggressiveness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Through displacement, the patient may
begin </u></span><u><span style="">to </span></u><u><span style="">act out his hostile impulses.</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>His
grip on reality begins </u></span><u><span style="">to
</span></u><u><span style="">loosen</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
first his delusions are limited, but later they become numerous and changeable
x x x x x x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delusions of persecution
are the most prominent occurrences in paranoid schizophrenia, but expansive </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">obviously wish-fulfilling ideas and hypochondriacal and depressive
delusions are not uncommon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
increasing personality disorganization, delusional beliefs become less
logical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verbal expressions may be
inappropriate and neologistic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
patient is subjected to vague magical forces, and his explanations become
extremely vague and irrational.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Imaginative fantasy may become extreme but take on the value of
reality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Repressed aggressive
tendencies may be released in a major outburst; some inarticulate paranoids may
manifest an unpredictable assaultiveness</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many paranoid schizophrenics are irritable, discontented, resentful, and
angrily suspicious and show a surly aversion to being interviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some manifest an unapproachable, aggressively
hostile attitude and may live in a bitter aloofness" (Noyes' Modern
Clinical Psychiatry, Seventh Edition, pp. 380 and 381, underscoring supplied).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the prognosis of schizophrenia, the aforenamed source thus
further states:</p>

<blockquote>"Occasionally one observes a schizophrenic episode of <span style="">a </span>mild, <span style="">fleeting nature with no subsequent
recurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In many instances,
however, the favorable outcome should be characterized as ‘social recovery’
rather than as ‘cured’ or as full recovery</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By this it is meant that the patient is able to return to his previous
social environment and to previous or equivalent occupation, but with minor
symptoms and signs, such as irritability, shyness, or shallowness of affective
responses.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From what has been said, it is evident that in any given case
the effect upon the personality and future adjustment of the appearance of a
schizophrenic reaction may be quite uncertain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In some cases the course is continuously progressive; in others it is
intermittent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>More frequently it is a
question of remissions and relapses in which, although from the first interests
and habits tend to be undermined insidiously, there occur periods of adjustment
at a lower level for a considerable period of time.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It </u><u><span style="">is estimated that 40 per cent of the
schizophrenic patients who enter public mental hospitals or clinics recover or
improve; the other 60 per cent fail to improve or ultimately suffer that
permanent, malignant disorganization of personality somewhat inaccurately
designated as deterioration</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
committed patients who improve sufficiently to be released, about 80 per cent
leave the mental hospital within the first year of residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The expectancy of recovery falls with each
year of continued illness</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roughly,
about one-third of those patients who are hospitalized during the first year of
their illness make a fairly complete recovery; one-third get a bit better and
become <u>able to return to outside life but remain damaged personalities and
may have to return to the hospital from time to time</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x (pp. 387-388, <u>supra,</u>
underscoring supplied).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When appellant was examined and treated for the first time on
July 28, 1962, his father revealed the patient's initial symptoms of laughing
alone and making gestures, poor sleep and appetite, praying and kneeling always
and making his body rigid (per con­sultation chart, p. 154, CCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon interview <span style="">on aforesaid date, appellant stated that
"he could see God" and "That a neighbor is bewitching her"
("pina­pakulam ako") Why?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"hindi ko alam kung bakit" (p. 156, CCC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant underwent eighteen (18) treatments and checkups from
July 28, 1962 to July 24, 1970 which covered eight (8) years before the alleged
crime was committed on September 8, 1970 (Medical Certificates, pp. 25 and 26,
CCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the medical certificate
dated September 15, 1970, the following was reflected:</p>

<blockquote>"Diagnosis - Schizophrenic Reaction - Recovered (1962)
Improved (1964) <span style="">Unimproved (1966)".</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Per the same record dated November 22, 1966, appellant's
diagnosis was described as <u>"Schizo?</u><u><span style="">Reaction Relapse</span></u><span style="">" and his
condition of termination was indicated as "Unimproved".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In appellant's "Out-Patient Psychiatric Service Record"
dated January 31, 1968 (p. 126, CCC rec.), his condition of termination was
described as merely "improved" neither "recovered" nor
"unimproved".</p>

<p class="BODY">In another "Out-Patient Psychiatric Service Record"
dated August 31, 1968, patient's condition of termination was also described as
"improved" only and "treatment not completed" was noted
therein (p. 137, CCC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was treated eighteen (18) times in the National Mental
Hospital and Jose Reyes Memorial Hospital from July 28, 1962 to July 24, 1970
or for <span style="">a span of 8 years, characteristic
of the chronic nature of his mental disease (pp. 4-5, TSN, November 12,
1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on direct examination, Dr.
Carlos Vicente confirmed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q - From your study, when he was
an out patient at the National Mental Hospital and its extension at the Jose
Reyes Memorial Hospital, would you say that he was and has been suffering from
chronic schizophrenia?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A - Yes, chronic, because it
started in 1962 and became in <u>remission in </u><u><span style="">1970, July"</span></u><span style=""> (p.
10, TSN, January 11, 1971, underscoring supplied).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For chronic schizophrenia, the patient does not recover fully in
two months' time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His condition may
simply be "in remission", which term means "social
recovery", not cured or fully recovered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. Vicente thus stated:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q
- </span>How long, if there is any usual period, does a schizophrenic attack
last at any given time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A - T<span style="">hat is </span>waivable (sic).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are those who cannot recover and there are those who recover after
ten days or <u>three months</u>" (p. 14, TSN, January 11, 1971,
underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On a schizophrenic's behavior pattern:</p>

<blockquote>"Q - <u>Is it possible that a
person </u><u><span style="">suffering from chronic </span>schizophrenia
</u><u><span style="">can have a violent reaction</span></u><span style="">?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A - <u>Yes, it is possible, if he
was</u> at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he is
schizophrenic at the time" (Testimony of Dr. Carlos Vicente, p. 10, TSN,
January 20, 1971, underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q - By suffering from
schizophrenia, <span style="">would </span>you say
that his suffering has <span style="">affected his
power of control over his will?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A - During the time that he <span style="">was </span>suffering,
he could not stick to the right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He </span>made mistakes at the time that he
was mentally sick.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q - <u>His power of control over
his will to commit a crime is affected</u>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A - <u>Yes, sir.</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q - <u>Are you sure of that</u>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A- <u>Yes, somehow it is
controlled </u><u><span style="">by <span style="">some </span></span>ideas, example, one who
has that (im)pulse to kill will kil</u>l” (Testimony of Dr. Carlos Vicente, p.
17, TSN, January 11, 1971, underscoring supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the mental condition of appellant when the alleged crime was
committed which is and should be considered determinative of his liability:</p>

<blockquote>"Q - Would you be able to state
Doctor <u>whether the accused when </u><u><span style="">he
</span>committed the act was suffering from an onset </u><u><span style="">of schizophrenic reaction</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">from
which he has been known to be suffering since 1962?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A - <u>It is possible, sir, that
he was already suffering fr</u><u><span style="">om</span>
an onset of the schizophrenic reaction at that time</u>” (Testimony of Reynaldo
Robles, p. 6, TSN, January 20, 1971, under­scoring supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be stressed that between July 24, 1970 when appellant
suffered from his last attack or relapse and September 8, 1970 when he
committed the alleged crime, barely 1 month and 15 days had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Medically speaking, the interval was not
sufficient time for appellant's full recovery nor did such time give <span style="">any </span>guaranty for his mental disease to
be "cured".</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span style="">was </span>still
mentally sick at the time he attacked the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He previously suffered from a
"displacement of aggressive and hostile behavior" when he got angry
with his wife and when he tied and boxed their dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had the mental delusion that a "mang­kukulam"
was inflicting harm on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
delusion found its mark on the victim whom he believed was the “<span style="">mangkukulam" and fearing that she would
harm him, appellant had to kill her in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simply stated, the victim was a mere consequence
of his mental delusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He killed the
"mangkukulam" as personified by the victim; he did not kill Aling
Kikay herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the said fatal act
was made by appellant i</span><span style="">n </span><span style="">defending himself from the
"mangkukulam".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it has been established that appellant was
"manageable" and was "presently free from any social
incapacitating psychotic symptoms" during the trial, the fact remains that
at the very moment of the com­mission of the alleged crime, he was still a
mentally sick person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was
produced to prove otherwise against the bulk of appellant's medical history for
8 years clearly indicative of his mental psychosis.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, "social recovery" of a schizophrenic
does not mean that he is "cured" (totally recovered) from the disease.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the foregoing,
appellant should be acquitted of the charge of murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
