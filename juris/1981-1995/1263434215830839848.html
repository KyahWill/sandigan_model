				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The instant petition for

Secretary's power to discipline employees <span style="">of the </span></span><span style="">Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) below the rank of Assistant General
Manager in his capacity as <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u> of the President.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 15, 1987, President
Corazon C. Aquino issued Administrative Order No. 25 creating a Presidential
Committee on Public Ethics and Accountability, Sec. 1 of which declares as a
policy that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Department Secretary shall be directly responsible to the
President in eradicating graft and corruption in his Department and the
offices, agencies, government-owned or controlled corporations attached to or
under his Department.  The Department
Secretary shall likewise be responsible to the President for the implementation
of policies and programs to minimize or prevent graft and corruption and to
promote the ethical standards of public service."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to the mandate
of A.O. No. 25, former DOTC Secretary Rainerio Reyes issued Office Order No.
88-318 creating the Administrative Action Board (AAB) "to act, decide and
recommend to the Secretary appropriate measures on cases of administrative
malfeasance, irregularities, grafts and acts of corruption in the
Department."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 26, 1988, two
PPA police officers; Rosmelito del Mundo and Geronimo Gorospe, filed in the AAB
which was then presided by Chairman Onofre Villaluz, a complaint for dishonesty
and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service against Leopoldo
Bungubung, District </span><span style="">Manager of the Port of Manila (AAB-031-88).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Bungubung filed his
answer but later, he filed a motion to dismiss assailing the jurisdictional
competence of the AAB on the ground that it was the General Manager of the PPA
who had jurisdiction over the case.  AAB
denied the motion to dismiss in </span><span style="">a written order which was issued by Secretary Reyes
himself upon the recommendation of the AAB.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, the PPA
General Manager, Rogelio A. Dayan, filed another "formal charge"
against Bungubung and one Mario Tan for dishonesty, inefficiency and incompetence
in the performance of official duties, willful violation of reasonable office
rules and regulations and/or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the
service.  Docketed as Adm. Case No.
11-01-88, the case was indorsed to the AAB for appropriate action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Questioning the
jurisdiction of the AAB over the administrative cases against him, Bungubung
filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction and/or temporary
restraining order with this Court (G.R. Nos. 86468-69).  In the resolution of January 26, 1989, the
Court required the respondents to file their comment on the petition and issued
a temporary restraining order enjoining the AAB from further acting on the
administrative cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, on August 26,
1988 or on the same date that the first administrative case against Bungubung
was filed, Secretary Reyes </span><span style="">also </span><span style="">filed a complaint with the AAB against
Cristeto Dinopol, then Manager of the Port of Davao, for dishonesty, grave </span><span style="">misconduct, conduct
prejudicial to the best interest of the </span><span style="">service and for violation of the Anti-Graft
Law (Adm. Case No. AAB-006-88).  PPA
General Manager Dayan then issued a preventive suspension order against
Dinopol.  On September 19, 1988, said
PPA General Manager also filed Adm. Case No. AAB-016-88 against Dinopol for
dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At
the hearings conducted by the AAB, Dinopol actively participated.  He presented his evidence therein although
he asserted that the PPA General Manager, not the AAB, had jurisdiction to
initiate and conduct an administrative investigation under Sec. 8 of P.D. No.
857; the PPA Charter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
October 27, 1988, the AAB rendered a decision in Adm. Case AAB-006-88 finding
Dinopol guilty as charged and imposed on him the penalty of dismissal from the
service with cause plus the accessory penalties of cancellation of
eligibilities, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits, and
disqualification for re-employment in the government service.  On November 23, 1988, AAB rendered its
decision in Adm. Case AAB-016-88 also finding Dinopol guilty as charged.  He was also meted the same penalty and its
accessories as those imposed on him in Adm. Case AAB-006-88.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Copies
of said decisions were mailed to Dinopol on December 6, 1988 but on that day,
Dinopol filed with the Regional Trial Court of Pasig,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a petition for
certiorari, prohibition and mandamus with prayer for preliminary injunction
and/or temporary restraining order challenging the jurisdiction of the AAB over
the administrative cases against him.  The following day, said court issued an order directing the respondents
therein (petitioners herein) "to desist from continuing the proceedings of
the Administrative Action Board" and "to observe the status quo on
the situation prior to (Dinopol's) suspension."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents
therein opposed the application for the </span><span style="">issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction but on January 9, 1988, the
court issued a resolution ordering the reinstatement of Dinopol to his former
position of Port Manager of Davao and the payment to him of back salaries and
other emoluments during his preventive suspension.  The court also issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed
for by Dinopol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A motion praying for the
reconsideration of the said resolution and for the dissolution of the writ was
filed by the respondent officials therein.  On the other hand, Dinopol filed a motion to cite<span style=""> </span>the PPA General Manager in contempt of court for failing to
reinstate him and pay his back salaries.  On January 26, 1989, the court denied the motion and directed the
immediate implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction with a warning
that in case of non-compliance therewith, respondent officials, therein shall
be fined P1,000.00 and imprisoned for a period not exceeding one month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This prompted the said
respondents to file with this Court a petition for certiorari and prohibition
with an urgent prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or
writ of preliminary injunction.  Acting
on the petition which was captioned as "Hon. Rainerio O. Reyes, etc., et
al. v. Engr. Cristeto E. Dinopol, et al." and docketed as G.R. No. 86646,
on February 2, 1989, this Court issued the temporary restraining order prayed
for and enjoined the lower court to cease and desist from implementing the
resolution and writ of preliminary injunction both dated January 9, 1989 as
well as the order of January 26, 1989.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">G.R. Nos. 86488-69 (the
Bungubung case) and G.R. No. 86646 (the Dinopol case) were later consolidated
upon the submission of the petitioners in the latter case that the two
petitions present the common issue of whether or not the Secretary of the DOTC
and/or the AAB have jurisdiction to initiate and hear administrative cases
against PPA personnel whose rank are below that of an assistant general
manager.  After their consolidation, the
two cases were referred to the Court of Appeals "for appropriate
action."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The cases were docketed
in the Court of Appeals as CA - G.R. No. SP-17195.  Asserting that the periods of their preventive suspension had
been unduly extended, Bungubung and Dinopol moved for their immediate
reinstatement <u>pendente</u> <u>lite</u>.  The Court of Appeals granted the motion in its resolutions of July 5 and
20, 1989.  Hence, then DOTC Secretary
Oscar Orbos, PPA General Manager Dayan and then AAB Chairman Villaluz
interposed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with urgent prayer for the
issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction
with this Court, submitting the issue of whether or not Dinopol and Bungubung
were entitled to immediate reinstatement and payment of backwages pending
adjudication on the merits of their cases by the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting on said petition
which was docketed as G.R. No. 92358, on March 20, 1990, the Court issued a
temporary restraining order enjoining the Court of Appeals from implementing
its resolutions of July 5, 1989, July 20, 1989 and January 19, 1990.  In due course, on November 21, 1990, the
Court <u>En</u> </span><u><span style="">Banc</span></u><span style=""> rendered a decision granting the petition.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 17, </span><span style="">1990, the Court of
Appeals promulgated its decision in CA-G.R. SP-17195.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In substance, the
Court of Appeals ruled that the DOTC Secretary is without jurisdiction over the
administrative cases against Bungubung and Dinopol for two reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">First</span></u><span style="">.  While the Civil Service Law
vests upon the Department heads "jurisdiction to investigate and decide
matters involving disciplinary action against officers and employees under
their jurisdiction,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> said law cannot
prevail over <span style="">Sec. </span>8, Art. V of
the PPA Charter (P.D. No. 857) which states that "(t)he General Manager
(of the PPA) shall, subject to the approval of the Board, appoint and remove
personnel below the rank of Assistant General Manager." The Court of
Appeals explained:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The above-quoted provision is in the nature of a special law
while the present Civil Service Law granting jurisdiction to department heads,
is in the nature of a general law.  Special law prevails over general law.  Being a special rule limited to the creation and functions of the Philippine
Ports Authority, PD No. 857 prevails over the Civil Service Law, insofar as it
involves jurisdiction to remove<span style=""> personnel below the rank of Assistant General
Manager as specifically lodged in the PPA General Manager.  The Civil Service Law authorizes a
department head to </span><span style="">commence and
try administrative cases, but this general provision must yield to the specific
provision found in the PPA Charter.  The
particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken
to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the
provisions of the particular enactment (25 R.C.L., p. 1010, citing numerous
cases)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The appellate court also stressed that, not only is
the PPA Charter a particular law - said Charter, having been enacted on
December 23, 1975, is a more recent enactment than P.D. No. 807 which was
issued on October 6, 1975.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Second</span></u><span style="">.  </span><span style="">The power of review
by the Office of the President has been repealed by P.D. 1409.  The DOTC Secretary, acting as the </span><u><span style="">alter</span></u><span style=""> <u>ego</u></span><span style=""> of the President, can no longer exercise disciplinary jurisdiction over
PPA personnel:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  Further, the
power of review by the Office of the President under P.D. No. 807 was repealed
by P.D. 1409 creating the Merit Systems Board in the Civil <span style="">Service Commission (Meran v. Edralin, 154
SCRA 235).  The theory that Secretary
Reyes, acting as alter ego of the President, can no longer be sustained.  The Administrative Action Board (AAB) of the
DOTC must yield to the jurisdiction of the PPA General Manager."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner
moved for the reconsideration of the decision of the Court of Appeals but the
motion was denied.  Hence, the instant
recourse through a petition for review on certiorari submitting that the Court
of Appeals' decision is contrary to law and settled jurisprudence because:  (a) it effectively deprived the DOTC
Secretary, acting as the </span><u><span style="">alter</span></u><span style=""> <u>ego</u> </span><span style="">of the President, of the authority to control
and/or supervise personnel actions involving employees of the PPA; (b) it nullified
the proceedings of the AAB for want of jurisdiction, notwithstanding that
respondent Dinopol submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the body, and (c)
it granted writs of certiorari in favor of </span><span style="">respondents who, on the other hand, failed to exhaust <span style="">available </span>and adequate remedies.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue of the
jurisdiction of the Secretary of the DOTC and/or the AAB over administrative
cases involving personnel <span style="">below the

<blockquote>Although the foregoing section does not expressly provide for a

personnel like the private respondents herein, is correct only to a certain

spectacle of the DOTC Secretary acting as complainant-initiator of an </span><span style="">administrative </span><span style="">case which later falls upon him to review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What is prescribed by the
law and the </span><u><span style="">Beja</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">case
is that all </span><span style="">complaints against a PPA official or employee below the rank of Assistant
General Manager shall be filed before the PPA General Manager by the proper
officials, such as the PPA police or any aggrieved party.  The aggrieved party should not, however, be
one and the same official upon whose lap the complaint he has filed may
eventually fall on appeal.  <u>Nemo</u> <u>potest</u>

<blockquote>"Attachment of an agency to a Department is one of the three

<blockquote>An attached agency has a larger measure of independence from the
Department to which it is attached than one which is under departmental
supervision and control or administrative supervision.  This is borne out by <span style="">the </span>'lateral relationship' between the Department and the
attached agency.  The attachment <span style="">is merely for
‘policy and program coordination.’ With respect to administrative matters, the
independence of an attached agency from Departmental control and supervision is
further reinforced by the fact that even an agency under a Department's
administrative supervision is free from Departmental interference with respect
to appointments and other personnel actions "in accordance with the
decentralization of personnel functions' under the Administrative Code of
1987.  </span><u><span style="">Moreover</span></u><span style="">, <u>the</u> <u>Administrative</u> <u>Code
explicitly</u> <u>provides</u> <u>that</u> <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u> <u>of</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Book</span></u><span style=""> <u>VI</u> <u>on</u>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Thus, while PPA personnel are, as mandated by P.D.
868, "embraced in the Civil Service," the DOTC may not "act
directly whenever a specific function is entrusted by law or regulation to a
subordinate.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
should be noted that in AAB-031-88, the complaint against Bungubung was
erroneously filed directly with the AAB and it was no less than DOTC Secretary
Reyes who, upon the recommendation of the AAB, denied Bungubung's motion to
dismiss.  The PPA General Manager also
errodeously indorsed to the AAB Adm. Case No. 11-01-88, the complaint he
himself filed against Bungubung, without having conducted an investigation and
recommending the appropriate penalty as required by the facts found at said
investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With
regard to Adm. Case No. AAB-006-88 against Dinopol, it was filed with the AAB
by Secretary Reyes himself while the other </span><span style="">case against Dinopol, Adm. Case No. 016-88, was filed by the PPA General
Manager directly with the AAB without said PPA official's appropriate
investigation and corresponding recommendation.  Under these circumstances, the absurd situation mentioned above
could ensue:  the DOTC Secretary
deciding on appeal his own complaint.  On the other hand, in Adm. Case No. 016-88, the PPA General Manager
abdicated his duty of conducting an investigation and submitting his
recommendation, as demanded by his factual findings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Filing a case directly
with the AAB may be a shortcut to accomplish the laudable purpose of A. O. No.
25.  However, whatever advantage may
accrue therefrom in terms of time element, may be offset by the denial of the
right to a fair and unbiased proceeding insofar as the personnel complained
against is concerned.  At the very
least, he should be afforded the opportunity of confronting the charges against
him in the forum where the law requires that they should be ventilated.  If at all, this procedure may deprive the
DOTC Secretary of control and supervision over personnel of the PPA below the
rank of Assistant General Manager but only at </span><span style="">the <u>initial</u>
</span><span style="">stage of an administrative proceeding.  Should the defendant employee be
dissatisfied with the ruling of the PPA General Manager, he can always elevate
his case to the DOTC Secretary wherein the AAB will play a pivotal role or, at
his option, go directly to the Civil Service Commission.  Hence, the Court of Appeals </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">less than accurate in
its sweeping statement that the DOTC Secretary, as <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u> of
the President, has completely lost control and supervision over disciplinary
matters involving the PPA employees concerned.  In fact, in the administrative hierarchy set up under both the PPA
Charter and the Civil Service Law, the DOTC Secretary has the ultimate say
before recourse to the courts may be made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
Court, however, agrees with the Court of Appeals' ratiocination in arriving at
the conclusion that Sec. 8, Art. V of the PPA Charter should prevail over <span style="">Sec. </span>37(b) of the Civil Service Law,
considering that where a later special law on a particular subject is repugnant
to, or inconsistent with, a prior general law on the same subject, a partial
repeal of the latter will be implied to the extent of the inconsistency, or an
exception grafted upon the general law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Since, in a sense,

that whenever the legislature enacts a law, it has in mind the previous

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Applying the foregoing
rules on statutory construction, the DOTC Secretary has not entirely
relinquished his power of control and supervision over an attached agency, such
as the PPA.  The PPA Charter merely
defined and, to a certain extent, delimited such power which, under the Civil
Service Law is of general application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners'
claim that the private respondents are estopped </span><span style="">from challenging the jurisdiction of the AAB as they actively
participated in the proceedings therein deserves scant consideration.  While it is true that a party may be
estopped from raising the question of jurisdiction on appeal,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> such estoppel may be invoked successfully
only if the party failed to raise such question in the early stages of the
proceedings.  The records show that Bungubung
did not wait for the rendition of an AAB decision before he questioned its
jurisdiction.  After filing his answer,
he filed a motion to dismiss on the issue of jurisdiction and even went to the
extent of elevating the issue to this Court.  For his part, Dinopol also filed a motion to dismiss the case against
him and, upon its denial, filed a motion for reconsideration.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the absence of proof of laches on the

the ruling in the <u>Tijam</u> case is but an exception to the general rule
that the lack of jurisdiction of a court may be raised at any stage of the
proceedings, even on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies
applicable in this case.   Besides the
fact that the AAB was patently without jurisdiction to act on the
administrative complaints filed against respondents Dinopol and Bungubung, the
instant petition raises only questions of law, one of the exceptions to the
general rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies.   Most enlightening is the following portion of
the decision in <u>Quisumbing</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Gumban</u>:<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"x x x.   The doctrine
of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a hard and fast rule.   It has been repeatedly held that the
principle requiring previous exhaustion of administrative remedies is not
applicable where <u>the</u> <u>question</u> <u>in</u> <u>dispute</u> <u>is</u> <u>purely</u>
<u>legal</u> <u>one</u>: <u>  where</u> <u>the</u>
<u>controverted</u> <u>act</u> <u>is</u> <u>patently</u> <u>illegal</u> <u>or</u>

jurisdiction; where the respondent is a department secretary, whose acts as an
alter ego of the President, bear the implied or assumed approval of the latter;
where there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention;
or where the respondent has acted in disregard of due process.   The rule does not apply where insistence on
its observance would result in nullification of the claim being asserted; and
when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy."
