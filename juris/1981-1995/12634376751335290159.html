<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The records show that

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appointment and inclusion as court
stenographer in the plantilla of said trial court, without prejudice to the
filing of the appropriate administrative charge.  This was precipitated by several incidents as explained in the
aforesaid order of Judge Gonong, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of the fact that this court has been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">functioning </span>with ONLY ONE stenographer
since July, 1984 in the person of Mrs. Rebecca J. Herrera due to the fact that
the other stenographer, Ms. Elizabeth San Juan had been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">on </span>a prolonged sick leave since July, 1984 and the other one,
Mrs. MARILYN O. SAAVEDRA, whose services as such (are) sorely needed, the
services of the latter could not be effectively utilized since July, 1984 up to
the present, reason being her frequent absences without any justifiable cause,
which is a culpable violation of her oath of office amounting to abandonment of
her position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As evidence of Mrs. Saavedra's indifference to her official
duties and abandonment of her position are:  (1) From the period covering the months of July, August and September
she had, on several occasions, absented herself without justifiable cause
and/or did not report for duty, and as regards her timecard, she leaves the
court without punching it, in order to attend to her personal businesses, never
to return again until the next day when she reports and punches again her
timecard, making entries thereon in ballpen, thus falsifying her entries
(Please refer to Mrs. Saavedra's Daily Time Card for the month of July (and)
August, now with the Leave Section of the Supreme Court); (2) Sometime in the
first week of September, 1984 Mrs. Saavedra requested permission to transfer to
Branch LIII of this Court of (sic) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">which
said request was granted and thereafter she did not report anymore to this
court; (3) Surprisingly, on September 18, 1984 Mrs. Saavedra filed a letter
requesting permission to transfer to Branch CXLII of the Regional Trial Court
of Makati (NCJR), the same was again granted x x x; (4) Lately, Mrs. Saavedra
appeared again in court requesting that a letter/order be issued for her to be
detailed in any branch of the RTC-Makati, and there being no merit in it, the
same was denied due course.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"With the above findings, this court is of the considered view
that these actuations of Mrs. Marilyn O. Saavedra means (sic) only one thing,
that is, SHE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE WITH THE SERVICE, and that her continued
stay would only serve as a blot to the good name of the judiciary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and, above all, prejudicial to the interest
of the litigants in court cases."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Regulations, hence, Complainant charges Respondent with misrepresentation,

follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">That on September 16, 1989, without the knowledge of herein
Complainant, the Respondent prepared and filled up her daily time records (Form
No. 48) for the months of April, 1989 up to August, 1989 inclusive and
presented the same for certification to the Presiding Judge of said sala.  The Presiding Judge, not being aware that
said daily time records were not in accord of (sic) what appeared in the
logbook and acting on the impression that those daily time records were correct
as the same were already signed by the Respondent, certified the correctness of
said entries.  Respondent then filed the
said daily time records to (sic) the office of the Administrative Services of
the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="2Q">Later, the Presiding Judge came to know that the daily time records
were prepared without consulting the logbook, called complainant in his
chamber, the former informing the latter that he was deceived by Respondent;
the Complainant got the transmittal of the daily time records to the Office of
the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Makati, Metro Manila, stamped
received and showed the same to the Presiding Judge (Pls. see Annexes 'H',
'H-1' and 'H-2').  Complainant sent a
telegram addressed to the Office of the Hon. Court Administrator not to allow Respondent
to withdraw the daily time records already filed (Pls. see Annex 'I'), and also
followed by a formal letter dated September 20, 1989 with the same tenor (Pls.
see. Annex 'J').  Respondent sensing
that Complainant was already aware of the daily time records signed by the
Presiding Judge, intended to fill up application forms for leave and with the
intention of swapping the same with the daily time records already with the
Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In answer to the telegram
and </span>letter, Ma. Rowena Castro-Benipayo, Asst. Chief of Office,
Administrative Services, in her letter dated September 26, 1989 (Pls. see Annex
'K') furnished complainant with certified xerox copies of said daily time
records on file with the Supreme Court attached thereto as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Annexes 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', and 'Q'.‚Äù<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"11. That upon
examination and comparison of the aforesaid daily time records marked as
Annexes 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P' and 'Q' inclusive, with the entries appearing
in the logbook and transmittal of daily time records to the Clerk of Court,
Complainant found the following discrepancies, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">a)  For the month of March, 1989, it appears
from the logbook and transmittal of daily time records to the Office of the
Clerk of Court that Respondent was absent on March 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31, 1989;
the reason was that Respondent guided her balikbayan sisters in different
places (Pls. see Annexes 'H' and 'H-1'; 'S'); in Annex 'S', her signature does
not appear and yet in her daily time record for the month of March, 1989 marked
as Annex 'L', she was present on those dates.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">b)  For the month of April, 1989, it appears
from the logbook that Respondent was absent on April 3, 4, 5 and 6, 1989,
reason:  she did continue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">guiding her balikbayan sisters (Pls. see
Annexes 'H', 'H-1' and 'I'), and yet in her daily time record for the month of
April furnished by the Supreme Court marked as </span>Annex <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">'M', she was present on those dates;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">c)  For the month of (sic) April 24, 25, 26, 27
and 28, 1989, Respondent joined the personnel who initiated a mass leave of
absence as substantiated by several Orders of the Court resulting in the
resetting of trials scheduled for hearing on those dates (Pls. see Annexes 'T',
'T-1', 'T-2', 'U', 'U-1', 'U-2', 'U-3', 'V', 'V-1', 'V-2', 'V-3' &amp;
'W').  In a resolution En Banc by the
Hon. Supreme Court dated April 27, 1989, the same should have been charged
against the accumulated leave credits of said employee (Pls. see Annexes 'X',
'X-1', 'X-2', and 'X-3') and yet in Respondent's daily time record for the
month of April, 1989 (Pls. see Annex 'M'), it appears that she was present (o)n
those dates.  Another thing noticeable
in Annex 'M', the name under the capitalized DAILY TIME RECORD written is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Marilyn A. </span>Oribiana</u> while the
signature below is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">MOSaavedra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">; </span>(t)his is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">d)  For the month of May, 1989, it appears from
the logbook that Respondent was absent on May 16, 1989 (Pls. see Annex 'Y') and
yet in Respondent's daily time record for the month of May, 1989 (Pls. see
Annex 'N') it appears that she was present on that date.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">e)  For the month of June, 1989, it appears from
the logbook that Respondent was absent on June 5, 1989 (Pls. see Annex 'Z') and
yet in Respondent's daily time record for the month of June, 1989 (Pls. see
Annex 'O') it appears that she was present on that date;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">f)  For the month of July, 1989, it appears
from the logbook that Respondent was absent on July 10, 11, 12 and 28, 1989
(Pls. see Annexes 'AA' and 'AA-1') and yet in Respondent's daily time record
for the month of July, 1989 (Pls. see Annex 'Q') it appears that she was
present on those dates.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">g)  For the month of August, 1989 the name
Marilyn A. Oribiana was typewritten below the capitalized words "DAILY

signature thereon, Judge de Guzman, doubting the veracity of respondent's DTRs,
immediately informed Atty. Mirano of his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">suspicions.  Upon verification with the court personnel's
logbook which was in the custody of Atty. Mirano, it was discovered that
respondent had actually incurred several absences from March to July of 1989

any application for leave filed by her therefor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mirano established that on March 27, 28, 29 and 31, 1989, as well as on April

guide for her two <i>balikbayan</i> sisters.  On April 24, 25, 26 and 27, 1989, respondent joined in the mass leave of
court personnel initiated by the Philippine Association of Court
Employees.  Withal, she did not file any
application for leave for these later dates, despite this Court's directive of
April 17, 1989 to the effect that the absences of </span>court personnel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">during the period from April 24 to April 28,

Mirano before
the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Makati anent the latter's
conduct in dealing with court personnel.  She likewise claims that she accomplished her DTRs without first
consulting the court logbook allegedly because Atty. Mirano refused to </span>give
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it to her and she was already being
required by the Office of the Court Administrator to submit the same, under
pain of being declared absent without leave (AWOL) and dropped from the
roll.  In addition, respondent submits
that if indeed she had incurred absences, the same could easily be charged
against her earned leave credits which were more than enough to cover her
absences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">What is worthy, of note,
however, is that respondent does not refute, much less deny, the testimony of
Atty. Mirano that she was indeed absent on certain specified dates and yet she
failed to report the same by not </span>filing the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">appropriate applications for leave.  In a futile attempt to rectify her alleged mistakes, or so respondent
claims, she tried to retrieve the DTRs which she submitted with the </span>leave
section of the Supreme Court but was deterred from doing so when Atty. Mirano
advised then Court Administrator Tiro not to allow her to change her DTRs.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

part of respondent to change the entries on her DTRs is, for all intents and
purposes, an admission on her part that she actually falsified the same.  The dishonesty of respondent in
misrepresenting to the court that she was present during the dates specified,
when in truth and in fact she did not report for work, constitutes serious
misconduct which we cannot countenance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her contention that Atty. Mirano merely filed this case in
retaliation for the complaint she filed before the Executive Judge of the
Regional Trial Court of Makati against the former, even if true, is of no
controlling significance.  Whatever
motivated Atty. Mirano to file the present administrative charge is beside the
point when we consider the preponderance of evidence proving that respondent is
guilty of falsifying her DTRs.  Moreover, the Court has observed that it has long been the practice of
respondent to falsify entries in her DTRs as this was also the precise reason
why Judge Gonong, in whose court she was previously employed, issued an
administrative order directing the cancellation of her appointment as court
stenographer.  This only serves to
fortify the postulation that Atty. Mirano was actually impelled by a sense of
vindication in administratively charging herein respondent.  Finally, and evidently, the fact that
respondent has sufficient leave credits to cover her absences cannot in law absolve
her from liability for falsification of her DTRs.</p>

to, hold inviolate, and invigorate the principle solemnly enshrined in the 1987
Constitution that a public office is a public trust; and all public officers
and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with
utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency.  The conduct and behavior of everyone
connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the
presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy
burden of responsibility.  Their
conduct, at all times, must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum
but, above all else, must be above suspicion.  Indeed, every employee of the judiciary should be an example </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">integrity, uprightness and honesty.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
