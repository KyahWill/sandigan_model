				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A complaint filed by Rosana M. Turla with the court below charged
appellant Romeo Pinca y Turla with the crime of forcible abduction with rape;
it read:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned complainant accuses ROMEO PINCA Y TURLA the
crime of forcible abduction with rape, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about August 11, 1991, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, with lewd designs and by means of force, violence, and
intimidation, to wit:  by threatening
her with a gun should she resist or refuse to go with him, abduct, take and
carry away the undersigned complainant in a taxicab from Del Pan Bridge, Tondo,
this City, to a house at Don Bosco, Tondo, this City, and while inside the said
house by means of force and violence or intimidation, to wit:  by forcing her to lie down, succeeded in
having carnal knowledge of the undersigned, 16 years of age, all against her
will and consent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused pleaded "not guilty" to the
accusation.  On 01 October 1991, the
prosecution and the defense stipulated thusly:</p>

<blockquote>“1.  That the accused and
the private complainant are second cousins;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  That prior to the incident in question, the
accused used to sleep in the house of the private complainant at an average of
three to four days a week;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  That at around 10:30 o'clock on the evening
of August 11, 1991, the accused and the private complainant were in the house
of the latter.  It was the intention of
the accused to sleep in the said house;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.  That later that evening, the accused and the
private complainant proceeded to the house of their aunt, Gloria Pinca.  In this regard, the complainant claims that
she was forced by the accused to go with him by threatening her with a gun and
forcing her to ride in a taxi with him to the house of their aunt, which claim
was denied by the accused, who alleges that the complainant voluntarily went
with him and that they merely walked to their aunt's house."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the complainant declared that on 11 August 1991, at
around 10:30 in the evening, the accused arrived at the residence of the
complainant.  He asked her to accompany
him to a nearby bakery.  On their way,
the accused poked a gun at her, hailed a taxicab and forced her to get on
board.  He instructed the driver to take
them to Don Bosco, Tondo, Manila.  He
took her to an unoccupied house of their aunt (Gloria Pinca).  Inside the house, the accused hit the
complainant twice.  He then made
advances on her and, when she resisted, he threatened her with a gun.  Accused-appellant tore her shirt, forced her
to lie down and forcibly undressed her.  She fought back, <u>albeit</u> without success, by kicking, scratching
and boxing the accused.  He ultimately
succeeded in raping her three times.  He
then hid her clothes to prevent her from leaving the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning, at around six o'clock, the complainant's
father arrived and forcibly opened the door of the house.  Entering, her father at once stabbed the
accused twice, one found its mark at the right wrist and the other at the back.  In spite of the injuries he sustained, the
accused was still able to run and escape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant's family, believing that the accused must have
died from his wounds, did not file, forthwith a complaint.  Upon learning, however, that the accused
survived his injuries, on 16 August 1991, they went to the Western Police
District Headquarters at United Nations Avenue, Manila, where they reported the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination made by Dr. Marcial Ceñido, Medico-Legal Officer
of the Western Police District, disclosed, among other things, the following
findings:</p>

<blockquote>“1.  Breasts are fairly developed, conical in
shape, firm and with prominent brownish nipples and areole;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  Abdomen is flat, firm and without striae of
pregnancy;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  Hymen is thick, stretched and with deep old
healed at 3, 6, 7 and 9 o'clock position;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.  Introitus vagina admits two (2) examining
fingers with relative ease, while vault is almost dry;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.  Last menstrual period - Last week of July
1991 for 3 days;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.  Purplish fading contusion, left infraorbital
region; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.  Four (4) small almost healed abrasions,
dorsum of the left hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>O</u> <u>P</u> <u>I</u> <u>N</u> <u>I</u>
<u>O</u> <u>N</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above findings is consistent with a girl who is no longer
a virgin."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused vehemently denied the accusation.  He insisted that the complainant had been
his "girlfriend" since 1990.  On the night of the alleged rape, he visited her at her house and found
her in the act of entertaining a suitor.  He confronted her, and an argument ensued between the two.  The complainant hastily left and proceeded
towards their aunt's house at Don Bosco, Tondo, Manila.  He immediately followed her.  They did not take a taxicab but merely
walked to the place, which was not that distant away.  At the house, they finally settled their misunderstanding and
decided to spend the night there at the behest of the complainant herself who
preferred not to go home.  The next
morning, the "uncle" (father) of the complainant arrived and,
suddenly, he started to stab the accused.  He was saved only by the timely intervention of the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused averred that the filing of the case was fabricated in
order to cover up the attempt against his life.  The accused admitted that he and the complainant had previous
carnal relations but denied that they had one on the night of 11 August 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 January 1993, the trial court rendered its decision,
finding the accused guilty; hence -</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the accused is hereby convicted of the complex
crime of forcible abduction with rape with the aggravating circumstances of
abuse of confidence, nighttime and uninhabited place and with no mitigating
circumstance, and sentenced to suffer <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> and to
pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant has interposed this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 March 1994, the Solicitor-General, representing the People,
submitted a manifestation and motion, in lieu of an appellee's brief, asking
for the reversal of the trial court's decision, thus -</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that Decision dated
January 28, 1993 in Crim. Case No. 91-97472 be REVERSED and the appellant be ACQUITTED
on reasonable doubt."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully reviewed the records of the case, and we,
ourselves, similarly find for acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quite damaging to the cause of the complainant was the testimony
of prosecution witness Dr. Marcial Ceñido, who conducted the physical
examination on the person of the supposed victim.  He himself testified:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
Doctor, in No. 3 of your findings states ‘Hymen is thick, stretched and with
deep old healed at 3, 6, 7 and 9 o'clock position,’ how old are the lacerated
wounds which you found?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
could have been months or even years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could
these lacerations be one week old at the time you examined the victim?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
Ma'am."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The physician's examination was made five
(5) days after the alleged rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also doubtful was accused-appellant's alleged use of a gun to
intimidate the complainant.  Accused-appellant was supposedly wearing only a pair of shorts when he
went to the house of the complainant.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
If, indeed, he had anything on his person she, quite strangely, did not see or
notice,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
although the gun was said to be about seven (7) inches long.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Unexplainably, accused-appellant did not attempt to use the gun to defend
himself, nor did it deter the complainant's father from attacking and twice
stabbing accused-appellant.  Yet, during
all this time, accused-appellant was supposedly holding the gun.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant's testimony itself suffered from material
inconsistencies.  In the hearing of the
case on 07 November 1991, she was asked by the Court to bring the clothes she
wore on the night she was allegedly raped.  On 14 November 1991, she told the Court that she did not bring the bra
because it was not torn,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
but when asked how the accused undressed her, she said "he pulled (her)
shirt and he tore (her) bra."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
She declared that at the time they were riding the taxicab, accused-appellant
was poking his gun at the taxicab driver;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
later, recounting the incident on board the taxicab, she, however, declared
that accused-appellant all the while was poking his gun at her.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
(It would seem unnatural, in fact, for a taxicab driver to pick up a half-naked
passenger who is poking a gun at a frightened woman in front of him.)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well known that appellate courts are often constrained to
rely on the assessment by trial courts of testimonial evidence, for it is the
trial judges who personally are able to observe the demeanor of witnesses and
how their testimonies are given.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It is assumed that in the process extreme care has been exercised by such
judges in weighing conflicting declarations of witnesses and in discerning
between fact and fiction.  In rape
cases, particularly, it would be well to consider that an accusation for rape
can be made with some degree of facility, and it is here, more than at anytime
perhaps, when a trial court understandably must have a concentrated attention
on, and should exercise great caution in the evaluation of, the testimony of
the complainant.  It would be most
unfortunate if such testimony were indeed to be received with precipitate
credulity.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, the defense is generally hard put to disprove the fact of
rape; thus, it is easy to appreciate the reason why the cause for the
prosecution must not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the
evidence for the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All told, like the Solicitor General, we are not convinced in
this case at bench that the prosecution has been able to establish appellant's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court is
REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  Accused-appellant is ACQUITTED of the offense charged, and this Court
orders his immediate release from detention unless there are lawful other
reasons for his continued confinement.</p>

accused-appellant and the complainant as to the identity of the person who
fetched the latter from the house and stabbed the former.  The accused-appellant kept on referring to
the complainant’s uncle as the person who stabbed him.  The complainant continued to say that it was
her father who committed the act.</p>
