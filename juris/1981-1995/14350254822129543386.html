The herein accused shall be entitled to one-half (1/2) of the preventive imprisonment he has already undergone in the service of his sentence.</p><p>"So Ordered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p></blockquote><p>In Criminal Case No. CCC-IV-67 (525)-NE, the trial court, in the absence of evidence of conspiracy and the autopsy examination of the victim Rolando Molina, acquitted Panfilo Bias.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p>Panfilo Bias appealed from the judgment of conviction. The version of the prosecution is as follows:</p><p>In the morning of February 18, 1968, at sitio Bulihan, Barrio Malimba, Municipality of Gapan, Nueva Ecija, Nathanael Lotuaco was in his farm together with his companions, Mario dela Cruz, Danilo dela Cruz and Rolando Molina. Three persons arrived, later on allegedly identified as Panfilo Bias, Ramon Jose and Mario Ramos. At that time victim Rolando Molina was sleeping in his hut, while victim Nathanael Lotuaco and the cousins Mario and Danilo dela Cruz were laying iron pipes on the ground. Ramon Jose asked Lotuaco the question in Tagalog: "<em>Pare, yari na ba ang kadena ng landmaster?</em>" (Friend, is the chain for the Landmaster already finished?) Without answering, Lotuaco told Mario de la Cruz to get the chain. Mario and Danilo left the place to comply. Not having gone far, Mario and Danilo heard two gunshots. Looking in the direction of the gunfire, they saw the victim Nathanael Lotuaco in a kneeling position with the accused Bias and his two companions behind him. Bias held a gun. The three then entered the hut, and the cousins afterwards heard two shots inside the hut. Both Mario and Danilo, because of fear, ran towards the creek and did not return to the hut. Later, they saw Lotuaco and Rolando already dead.6</p><p>Dr. Diosdado del Fonso, a rural health officer, conducted the autopsy on Lotuaco's cadaver, with the following findings:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"HEAD AND NECK:â€”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"(a) Gunshot wound of about 1/2 cm. in diameter with clean cut edges. The said wound is about 5 cm. away from the left pinna, on the occipital region, on the level of the left ear. The said wound is through and through to exit on the frontal aspect, about 2 cm. above the left eyebrow. The said wound is about 1 and 1/2 cm. by 2 cm. with corrugated edges.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>"(b) Gunshot wound on the left parietal region of about J1 cm. above the external auditory meatus of the left ear. The said wound is 1/2 cm. in diameter with clean cut edges to make an exit on the right parietal region of about 9 cm. above the right external auditory meatus. The said wound is the exit with 1 and 1/2 cm. by 2 cm. with corrugated edges.&nbsp; </p><p>"(c) Brain substances with blood are found oozing on the point of exit of the bullets. <br></p></blockquote><p>"IMPRESSION: Death is due to shock with internal hemorrhage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Dr. del Fonso testified that when victim Lotuaco was fired at he was most probably in a sitting or standing position, and his assailant was on his left side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Mario de la Cruz testified that he saw Lotuaco in a squatting position after he heard the shots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p>The version of the defense is as follows:</p><p>Accused-appellant Panfilo Bias presented as alibi that on February 18, 1968, he drove his tricycle to the house of Mayor Nagano of San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija, with Luis Asperas and Exequiel Marquez, at between 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. Between lunch time and 5:00 p.m. on that day he drove his tricycle to get passengers for pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Luis Asperas, Sixto Nunez, Tagumpay Nagano corroborated the alibi of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p>Sgt. Benito Vispo of the PC testified that the extrajudicial statements of witness Mario de la Cruz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> were taken before him and not before the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p>Artemio Reyes, the incumbent Chief of Police of San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija, testified that Adriano Marquez, son of Exequiel Marquez, was a policeman of that town from January 20 to April 2, 1968.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p>Exequiel Marquez and Luis Asperas were brought by the accused to the house of Mayor Tagumpay Nagano of San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija, on February 18, 1968, in the morning, on board the accused Bias' tricycle precisely to talk on the case filed against policeman Adriano Marquez.</p><p>Appellant questions the veracity and credibility of the testimony of the lone prosecution witness Mario de la Cruz as glaringly inadequate and insufficient for conviction in this case.</p><p>It is claimed that witness Mario de la Cruz contradicted himself in his testimony. As to the gun used by appellant in relation to the size of the victim Lotuaco's head wound, witness Mario de la Cruz was shown a .45 caliber gun during the trial, and he testified that it was that "kind of gun" that was used.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It is true that the entry wound in the head was caused by a .22 caliber firearm, but witness Mario de la Cruz did not testify that the gun used was a .45 caliber one. What he said was that he saw the appellant holding a small gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Witness Mario de la Cruz, having reached no higher than grade school cannot be expected to have knowledge of kind and caliber of guns. He had no experience in handling guns.</p><p>Regarding the witness Mario's description of appellant being dark complexioned, mustached, and limping, it was simply his first impression of appellant Bias. Witness Mario said he remembered appellant's face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Mario also stated that appellant could have shaved already.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Witness also said that it was not appellant but Ramon Jose who limped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> A person's complexion may be considered a relative matter. We are convinced of the positive identification of the appellant by witness Mario de la Cruz.</p><p>Mario de la Cruz knew the appellant's name is Bias because the Gapan Police told him so on February 20, 1968.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> His having failed to state Bias' name in the statement of February 21, 1968<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> must be for the reason that he was not asked by the P.C. investigators the name of the appellant. Witness Mario de la Cruz stated in his statement, Exhibit 9, that Narciso Ramos was one of those who shot the victim Lotuaco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He clarified that statement during the hearing, stating that appellant was the one who shot the victim, and Ramos was one of the appellant's companions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p>On the wounds of the deceased, Dr. Del Fonso testified that when the victim was fired at he was probably in a sitting or standing position, his assailant on his left side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Witness Mario de la Cruz testified that the victim was in a squatting position when the former saw the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Prosecution witness was not precise on this point because he was in a confused state of mind at that moment.</p><p>The supposed inconsistencies of the witness Mario de la Cruz in his testimony were more apparent than real. The trial court observed that witness de la Cruz, like any other normal witness "inexperienced and unlearned", had to fall into some inconsistencies. His "apparent confusion in dates was probably caused by the poor memory of herein witness which is not unusual under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Truthful witnesses are seldom perfect witnesses.</p><p>The evidence of record is bereft of any known motive why this witness should falsely testify against the appellant, or of any special personal interest in appellant's conviction. His testimony must be given full faith and credit.</p><p>It is true that witness de la Cruz did not testify that he saw the appellant shoot the victim. It is however true that this witness said that of the three intruders he "only saw Bias holding a gun."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Witness de la Cruz told the police that the appellant was the one who shot the victim;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that appellant Bias was the assailant;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and that "Panfilo Bias was the only one who shot Nathanael."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p>The positive identification of appellant by the witness Mario de la Cruz is beyond doubt, hence the alibi of appellant cannot stand against it. The trial court was morally convinced that it was appellant Panfilo Bias, together with Ramon Jose, deceased, and Narciso Ramos, still at large, who shot and killed the victim in the morning of February 18, 1968, and no evidence of record appears to contradict such conclusion.</p><p>WHEREFORE, the decision dated January 8, 1970, in Criminal Case No. CCC-IV-66 (524)-NE, is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against appellant.</p><p>SO ORDERED.</p><p><em>Barredo (Chairman), Aquino, Abad Santos </em>and<em> De Castro, JJ.,</em> concur.</p><p><br>&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> CCC-IV-66 (524)-NE and CCC-IV-67 (525)-NE.&nbsp; <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> p. 1, Original Record, CCC-IV-66 (524)-NE.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> p. 1, Original Record, CCC-IV-67 (525)-NE.</p>&nbsp; <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> pp. 42-43, rollo.</p>&nbsp; <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> pp. 43-45, rollo.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> pp. 5-8 t.s.n., April 14,1969. <br></p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Exh. 1, Exh.
