at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 p.m.</st1:time>, Ricardo Rivera
with companion Jaime <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> was walking along <span class="SpellE">Deparo</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> on their way to <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
reaching a place thereat near the school and store of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maring</span>, <span style="">a </span>motorcycle
with two (2) persons riding tandem passed by towards <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the motorcycle passed Ricardo Rivera and
companion, the rider behind the one driving the <span class="SpellE">motorcyle</span>
shot Ricardo Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two (2) persons
then fled towards <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Momentarily, for reasons only known to them
and apparently to make certain that Ricardo Rivera <span style="">was </span>dead, they turned back the
motorcycle, ran towards Ricardo Rivera and shot him again after alighting from
the <span class="SpellE">motorcyle</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two (2) shots found their marks at the back of victim Ricardo
Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim fell down mortally
wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span>
Arellano, who was then at the store of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maring</span> buying cigarettes and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
Rivera, brother of the victim who was then on his way home to <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span> and after hearing shots, both responded to help
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
Rivera placed the victim <span style="">in </span>a tricycle and rushed him to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately, <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Arellano </span>witnessed
the whole incident as the place of the crime was lighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw and recognized the person who shot the
victim <span style="">as </span>he
positively pointed to accused Gregorio Clamor as the killer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Rivera was
also positive and certain that he saw and recognized the person at the back
seat of the motorcycle as the accused Gregorio Clamor, the <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>
of his deceased brother, Ricardo Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention is that the deceased Ricardo Rivera was not
in a physical and mental condition to have intelligently given the question and
answer statement recorded by Detective <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alilam</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Police
Department and (allegedly) signed by the deceased at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00 p.m.</st1:time> on the same evening that he was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant seeks to base his contention here
on the testimony of Dr. Salvador, NBI Medico-Legal Officer, on
cross-examination that the bullet wounds sustained by the deceased would have
put the latter in deep trauma and shock within two (2) to five (5) hours after
the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Ricardo Rivera was
shot at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 p.m.</st1:time> in the
evening and the statement taken at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00
 p.m.</st1:time> in the same evening, appellant claims by that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo Rivera could not have understood the
questions put to him and given sensible answers thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal difficulty with appellant's argument is that it
places excessive reliance upon the precise time when the <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u>
statement was, in appellant's view, taken down and signed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, appellant did not
challenge the genuineness of Ricardo Rivera's signature on the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, the signed statement,
which was taken in longhand, itself recorded the time it was supposed to have
been made; 8:45 p.m. on 27 March 1981 or about an hour and fifteen (15) minutes
after the victim was shot earlier in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alilam</span> himself did estimate himself that the statement was
taken about 11:00 p.m. that evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It was clear from his statement, however, that <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alilam's</span> sense of the timing and sequence of events that
evening <span style="">in </span>the
hospital was rather impressionistic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
<span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alilam</span> also testified
that Ricardo Rivera died several hours after his statement <span style="">was </span>taken down in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Salting, and that Ricardo Rivera died at about 11:00 <span style="">p.m. </span>that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing appears clear:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alilam</span> testified that the statement was taken down not long
after the deceased was brought to the hospital; indeed, the attending physician
had not yet begun to examine the victim personally though a nurse had begun to
attend to him.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The entry of "8:45 p.m." on the statement of Ricardo Rivera having
been made in the regular course of official police business, the Court is bound
to presume that that time was correctly recorded.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
That presumption was not overcome by the impressionistic estimate given by <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alilam</span> on cross-examination
that the <u><span style="">ante-mortem</span></u><span style=""> </span>statement was taken at about 11:00
p.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, while <span class="SpellE">Det</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Alilam</span> had failed to have either <span class="SpellE">Det</span>.
Salting or Dr. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> sign the statement as
witnesses thereto, appellant has neither alleged nor proved that <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alilam</span> had deliberately
fabricated the whole <u><span style="">ante-mortem</span></u><span style=""> </span>declaration to falsely accuse an
innocent man.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Court believes that the trial court properly admitted
and took account of the <u><span style="">ante-mortem</span></u><span style=""> </span>statement of Ricardo Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider that that statement complied with
the requirements of a dying declaration, to wit?</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">While the gunshot wounds inflicted on
Ricardo Rivera did not immediately cause his death, he had anticipated the
onset of death while giving his statement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When asked whether he believed he was mortally wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo Rivera answered "(<u>S)a <span class="SpellE">palagay</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span></u>."
There is here sufficient indication that he believed that death would shortly
-- in a matter of hours -- take him away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also agree with the trial court that the statement of Ricardo Rivera
naming appellant as the gunman who had shot him was part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>,
admissible as a separate exception to the hearsay rule.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial court had rendered its decision sentencing
appellant for the crime of murder, two (2) of the prosecution witnesses
apparently executed affidavits in which they retract testimony given by
them:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio Rivera, father of the
victim Ricardo Rivera; and <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Arellano, uncle
of the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Gregorio Rivera had testified only in respect of hospital and funeral expenses
incurred by the family of Ricardo Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His affidavit of retraction, where he makes statements to the effect
that appellant Gregorio Clamor knew nothing about the murder of Ricardo Rivera
and that Ricardo was unconscious when he arrived at the hospital, is clearly
worthless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span>
Arellano had, <span style="">as </span>prosecution
witness, identified appellant <span style="">as </span>the
gunman, riding on the backseat of the motorcycle, who had shot Ricardo Rivera
as the motorcycle zoomed past him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
retraction affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Arellano, where he denied
that he had seen appellant Gregorio Clamor shoot the victim, cannot, however,
be given effect to absolve appellant from any participation <span style="">in </span>the killing of Ricardo Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The well-settled rule is summarized in <span class="SpellE"><u>Reano</u></span><u>, et al. v. Court of Appeals</u><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style=""> </span>The Court has looked with disfavor upon
retraction of testimonies previously given in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Court has ruled against the grant
of a new trial on the basis of a retraction by a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale for the rule is obvious:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Affidavits of retraction can easily be secured from poor and
ignorant witnesses usually for a monetary consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recanted testimony is exceedingly
unreliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is always the
probability that it may later be repudiated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So courts are wary or reluctant to allow a new trial based on retracted
testimony.</p>

<blockquote>However, when aside from the testimonies of the retracting witness
or witnesses there <span style="">is </span>no other
evidence to support a judgment of <span style="">conviction,
a new trial may be granted.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a witness testifies for the prosecution
and retracts his or her testimony and subsequently testifies for the defense,
the test in determining which testimony to believe is one of comparison coupled
with the application of the general rules in evidence, <span style="">as </span>enunciated in <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Ubina</span>
[97 Phil. 515 (1955)], where the Court said:<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The testimony of Ruben Francisco for the prosecution is claimed to
be unworthy of credit because later on he testified for the defense, declaring
that all he had stated against the defendants is not true. . .</p>

<p class="2Q">The theory of the defense that Francisco's previous testimony is
false, as he subsequently declared it to be so, is as illogical as it is
dangerous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Merely because a witness says
that what he had declared is false and that what he now <span style="">says </span>is true, is not sufficient
ground for concluding that the previous testimony is false.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such reasoning has ever crystallized into
a rule of credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is that
a witness may be impeached by a previous contradictory statement (Rule 123,
section 91); not that a previous testimony is presumed to be false merely
because a witness now says that the same is not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence of this Court has always
been otherwise, i.e., that contradictory testimony given subsequently does not
necessarily discredit the previous testimony if the contractions are
satisfactorily explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have also
held that if a previous confession of an accused were to be rejected simply
because <span style="">the latter subsequently makes
another confession, all that an accused would do to acquit himself would be to
make another confession out of harmony with the previous one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, it would be a dangerous rule for
courts to reject testimonies solemnly taken before courts of justice </span><span style="">simpl</span><span style="">y</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">because the witnesses who had given them
later on change their mind for one reason or another, for such rule would make
solemn trials </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">mockery </span>and place the investigation of
truth at the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If Francisco <span style="">says </span>that when he testified for the prosecution he was paid P700,
what can prevent the court from presuming that subsequently he testified for
the defense because the defendants also paid him to testify for them?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The rule should be that </u><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>testimony
solemnly given in court should not be lightly set aside and that before this
can be done, both the previous testimony and the subsequent one be carefully
compared, the circumstances under which each given carefully scrutinized, the
reasons or motives for the change carefully scrutinized -- in other words, all
the expedients devised by man to determine the credibility of witnesses should
be utilized to determine which of the contradictory testimonies represents the
truth</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
(Citations omitted; underscoring in the original)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has examined the testimony given by Arellano before the
trial court and the retraction affidavit later executed by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Arellano before the trial
court was forthright, clear and positive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Arellano had recognized appellant Clamor as the rider mounted behind the
man driving the motorcycle when the two (2) returned, after having passed and
shot Ricardo Rivera, and the rear rider dismounted, shot Ricardo again,
remounted the motorcycle and the two (2) riders sped off.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, in his affidavit, Arellano stated that he did not <span style="">see </span>the
shooting of Ricardo that he did not remember who had first brought up the name
of appellant Clamor <span style="">as a </span>possible
suspect due to an earlier dispute Clamor had with Ricardo concerning some farm
animals owned by Clamor.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
We do not believe that this simple, blanket denial warrants rejection of the
detailed testimony of Arellano, testimony that he had clung to throughout
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, we must note
that the decision of the trial court did not rest exclusively on the testimony
of Arellano:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there was the dying
declaration of Ricardo and the equally positive identification in court of
appellant as the killer by <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Rivera, a brother
of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant raised as his principal defense that at the time
Ricardo Rivera was shot, he (appellant) was in <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>
(or <span class="SpellE">Maypajo</span>), <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that as early as 9:00 o'clock in the morning of 27 March 1981, he
left <span style="">his </span>residence
at MBA Subdivision in <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City for <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> at the invitation and in the company of several
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took them at least two (2)
hours to reach their destination because instead of taking a bus or <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, they decided to go to <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>
on foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, the group ate lunch at
the house of one <span class="SpellE">Rody</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, they transferred to the place of one <span class="SpellE">Kiko</span>, also in <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, where they
finished two (2) bottles of gin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 4:00
o'clock in the afternoon, they <span class="SpellE">proceded</span> to the house
of a third friend, one <span class="SpellE">Taruk</span>, still in <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, to eat watermelons and then drank beer
afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were, appellant claims,
in <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> practically the whole day and evening leaving
at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They returned to <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City again by foot
arriving thereat at 12:00 o'clock midnight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not until the following morning that Gregorio Clamor learned
about the death of Ricardo Rivera; stories about <span style="">Gre</span>gorio's alleged participation in
the crime came to his knowledge only on 29 March 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then sought the assistance of his uncle
who volunteered to accompany him to the headquarters of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City Police for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
gave a written statement before the police investigator and was made to undergo
a paraffin test.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi, however, cannot overcome the dying
declaration of the victim and the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
which uniformly pointed to appellant as the person mounted on the back of the
motor­cycle who fired at Ricardo Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, appellant had not sufficiently demonstrated that it <span style="">was </span>physically
impossible for him to be in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City at any time
during the day assuming he was indeed in <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and was to
come from that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant made it <span style="">a </span>point to
stress that he and his companions had gone on foot all the while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public motor transportation was, of course,
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if he had opted to walk,
he himself had testified that he could have reached <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
from <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> in approximately two (2) hours or even less.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding in the Chemistry Report<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
prepared by the Forensic Chemistry Section of the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI), that nitrates were not found in the hands of appellant, is
not conclusive evidence that appellant did not fire a gun at the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court notes that the paraffin test was
conducted by the NBI on <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="3">30 March 1981</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon
while the shooting incident occurred in the night of <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="3">27 March 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As testified to by the NBI Forensic Chemist on cross-examination, there
are many factors that could cause the disappearance of nitrates or gunpowder
residue, e.g., perspiration and washing of the hands.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It cannot be discounted that after the lapse of more than two (2) days, the
powder residues, if any, had been washed away.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information alleges that appellant shot Ricardo Rivera with
treachery and evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court found both treachery and evident premeditation, either one of which
would of course qualify the killing to murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery was correctly taken into account by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was armed with a gun,
riding tandem on a motorcycle, suddenly and without warning shot Ricardo Rivera
in the back as the motorcycle sped by.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ricardo Rivera was then walking with another man, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, along the road to <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span>,
unsuspecting and unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motorcycle
then turned back and returned to where Ricardo lay wounded, and appellant fired
at Ricardo once more, again hitting him in the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo had no effective opportunity to
defend himself and to strike back at the assassin.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, evident premeditation cannot be said to have
been proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the elements of
evident Premeditation -- (1) proof of the time when the accused decided to
commit the crime; (2) proof of an overt act showing that the accused had clung
to his determination to commit the crime; and (3) the lapse of time between the
decision and the execution of the crime sufficient to allow the accused to
reflect upon the consequences of his acts -- ­had been established by the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nighttime was similarly erroneously appreciated by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Towards the end of the Decision,
the trial judge observed that the crime had been committed at night and
concluded that it was purposely sought not only to assure successful execution
of the killing but also to prevent identification or recognition by
eyewitnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ordinary rule,
however, is that <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> is deemed absorbed in
treachery and as such is not be appreciated separately.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span style="">may </span>be credited
with voluntary surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having learned
of the rumor about his participation in the killing of Ricardo Rivera,
appellant sought the advice of his uncle and then voluntarily went to the
police station for interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
surrendered himself personally to the police authorities and had his hands
subjected to a paraffin test to determine the presence of nitrates or gunpowder
residue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was released from detention
only upon posting of a bond in the amount of P30,000.00.</p>
