sentenced him to </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The facts, according to
the prosecution, follow:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The 13 year old minor <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> <span class="SpellE">Indita</span> y Alfonso had known the appellant <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Alfonso as a relative and neighbor in <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> since she was nine years old.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With her mother's permission, she went to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
alone to take her vacation at the house of her uncle Mario Alfonso, her
mother's brother, who lives in <span class="SpellE">Balic-Balic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>

was still dark outside, so she decided to wait for the morning light before
proceeding to her uncle's place in <span class="SpellE">Balic-Balic</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"While passing time inside the waiting station at the bus
terminal, she was approached by appellant <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
Alfonso who offered to accompany her to <span class="SpellE">Balic-Balic</span>
as it was still dark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Recognizing and
knowing him to be a relative, she accepted the invitation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant guided her to a dark place still
inside the terminal compound leading to <st1:street><st1:address>Roosevelt
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> which according to him, was a short cut.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the said dark place behind one of the buses, a place where
buses are cleaned, appellant made his move.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He pushed <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> and she fell face up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While in that position, she noticed that
appellant was beside her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She shouted
for help but appellant covered her mouth with a handkerchief using his left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then knelt between her legs and forcibly
took off her skirt and panty with his right hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Laila</span> resisted by boxing the
appellant, so that he was only able to pull her skirt and panty down to her
knees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But appellant who is definitely
stronger, succeeded in removing completely her skirt and panty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now kneeling again between her legs, he
pulled down his brief and pants to his knees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At this point, <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> was already feeling weak
and could not move anymore because one of her hands was pinned down by the left
hand of the appellant and her other hand was under her legs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was her first experience with a man that
she was so afraid, stunned by it and became immobile.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, using his right hand, mashed her
breasts and then inserted his penis into her vagina.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the left hand of the appellant covering her mouth with a
handkerchief loosened, she shouted for help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant was on top of her then and he took something from his side and
pressed it against her throat, threatening to kill her if she would shout.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After having carnal knowledge with <span class="SpellE">Laila</span>,
appellant put on his pants and brief, and then left.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only that time that the handkerchief
was removed from the mouth of the minor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then she put on her panty and skirt and ran to a bright place."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It was not impossible for the crime to have been committed thereat, as alleged
by the defense, since the concurring circumstances of time - around 4:00 o'clock
in the morning, and place - when there was very little mobility in the area -
afforded adequate opportunity for the crime to have been committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That there were hardly any people around is
shown by the fact that although <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> shouted for
help before the accused gagged her, no one came to her rescue.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

to her mother three (3) days later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
three-day delay cannot affect her credibility. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It was perfectly natural for her to have had
qualms about revealing a humiliating episode in her life to her uncle, a man,
who was only collaterally related to her compared to her mother in whom she
could repose full trust and confidence and who could listen to her sad and
delicate plight with fuller understanding and deeper compassion.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. In this third assigned error, the accused assails <span class="SpellE">Laila's</span> credibility and insists that just because she hails

convincing, free from any serious <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contradiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cross-examination to which she was

humiliation of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public trial, and to
an examination of her </span>private parts at an age when she was just flowering
into womanhood, if her purpose were other than to bring before the bar of
justice the villain who had wronged her.</p>

<p class="BODY">There may be some inconsistencies between her statement to the
police and her testimony in Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
example, in her statement she stated that the accused removed his pants and

<p class="BODY">4. The accused asserts that <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> was
motivated to file the complaint only because he had refused to lend money to
her uncle, Mario Alfonso.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>unworthy of credence just as it is
logically unsound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one, it is not
borne out by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For another, the
failure to lend money to an uncle has no connection at all with the indignity
committed on <span class="SpellE">Laila's</span> person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is incredible that a 13-year old girl
would claim in public that she was the victim of sexual assault simply to
settle a score which an uncle, a collateral relative, has with the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. The only defense of the accused is that of alibi and
denial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he was at the
Philippine Heart Center for <st1:place>Asia</st1:place> ministering to his wife
who was confined thereat from March 15 to <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
the defense of alibi to succeed, however, an accused must establish physical
impossibility and improper motive of prosecution witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused has been unsuccessful in either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Maura <span class="SpellE">Samin</span>, the other watcher at the
hospital, testified, on <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1982</st1:date>,
the date of the incident, her "duty" was from <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1:00 A.M.</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6:00 A.M.</st1:time>,
during which time interval, the accused was sleeping on a sofa outside his
wife's hospital room.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused himself admitted that he slept outside the room because starting at
<st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1:00 o'clock A.M.</st1:time>, visitors were no
longer allowed to go inside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the accused was not on watch on <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="4">April
 3, 1982</st1:date> at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4:00 A.M.</st1:time><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since he slept outside the room, he could
have easily slipped out of the hospital at that time without Maura's nor his
wife's knowing about it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, as the
Trial Court had found, and in this it did not err, the distance between the
Philippine Heart Center and the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> Terminal is
only short so that it was not physically impossible for the accused to have
been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">More, a defense of alibi
cannot prosper where the accused has been positively identified as the
assailant, as in this case.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">And as far as improper
motivation of prosecution witnesses is concerned, this has not been shown, but
on the contrary, as pointed out above, <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> and her
family could not have been impelled by any other motive except to seek </span>redress
for the shame and dishonor brought on <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> and the
wrong done to all of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In claiming that his
guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt, the accused would vary the
interpretation of the medico-legal report in that the finding of "strong
resistance of the vaginal orifice of the complainant to the insertion of the index
finger and the virgin-sized vaginal speculum" as well as the shallow
laceration of the hymen would negative rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again, this is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
medical certificate clearly concluded "Subject is in non-virgin state,
physically" (Exhibit "C").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The doctor's conclusion, therefore, that <span class="SpellE">Laila</span>
lost her virginity is an incontestable fact.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The medical finding of "resistance", far from disproving rape, only
serves to show that <span class="SpellE">Laila</span> was a virgin at the time
she was abused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
And as to the finding of shallow laceration of the hymen, this neither
negatives rape for, as has been consistently held, the slightest penetration of
the labia consummates the crime of rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Of note also is the fact that medical examination was performed only four (4)
days after the incident, which could account for the shallowness of the
laceration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Neither does the absence
of a finding in the medical certificate of physical injuries on <span class="SpellE">Laila's</span> person negate the commission of Rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be remembered that considering the
petite size of the victim (5' 1" in height and 100 lbs. in weight), the
accused, whom the Trial Court described as "tall and bulky", could
have easily overpowered her without much use of force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has also been held that absence in the
medical certificate of external signs of physical injuries and spermatozoa on
the victim does not negate the commission of rape.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Laila's</span> panty and dress
were not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">presented in evidence cannot
militate against the finding of guilt of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly held in People vs. Garcia,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

blood-stained dress and underwear of the complainant does not destroy the case
for the prosecution, there being sufficient and convincing evidence to prove
the rape charges beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those clothes are not essential, and need not be presented, as they are
not indispensable evidence to prove rape.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">That <span class="SpellE">Laila's</span>
testimony stands uncorroborated would neither tilt the scales in favor of the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is ample jurisprudence
holding that "when a woman testifies that she has been raped, she says in
effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed provided her
testimony is clear and free from contradiction, and her </span>sincerity and
candor, free from suspicion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
For, by the very nature of the crime of Rape, conviction or acquittal depends
almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony because of
the fact that usually only the participants can testify as to its occurrence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, like the Trial Court, we have found no reason to doubt <span class="SpellE">Laila's</span> credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

doubt.</p>
