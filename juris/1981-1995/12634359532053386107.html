<p class="BODY">Petitioner Manuel R. Dulay Enterprises, Inc., a domestic
corporation with the following as members of its Board of Directors:  Manuel R. Dulay with 19,960 shares and
designated as president, treasurer and general manager; Atty. Virgilio E. Dulay
with 10 shares and designated as vice-president; Linda E. Dulay with 10 shares;
Celia Dulay-Mendoza with 10 shares; and Atty. Plaridel C. Jose with 10 shares

and known as Dulay Apartment consisting of sixteen (16) apartment units on a
six hundred eighty-nine (689) square meter lot, more or less, located at
Seventh Street (now Buendia Extension) and F.B. Harrison Street, Pasay City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner corporation through its president, Manuel Dulay,
obtained various loans for the construction of its hotel project, Dulay
Continental Hotel (now Frederick Hotel).  It even had to borrow money from petitioner Virgilio Dulay to be able to
continue the hotel project.  As a result
of said loan, petitioner Virgilio Dulay occupied one of the unit apartments of
the subject property since 1973 while at the same time managing the Dulay
Apartment as his shareholdings in the corporation was subsequently increased by
his father.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">On October 1, 1979, private respondent Torres filed a petition
for the issuance of a writ of possession against private respondents spouses
Veloso and Manuel Dulay in LRC Case No. 1742-P.  However, when petitioner Virgilio Dulay appeared in court to
intervene in said case alleging that Manuel Dulay was never authorized by the
petitioner corporation to sell or mortgage the subject property, the trial
court ordered private respondent Torres to implead petitioner corporation as an
indispensable party but the latter moved for the dismissal of his petition
which was granted in an Order dated April 8, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, 1980, private respondent Torres and Edgardo Pabalan,
real estate administrator of Torres, filed an action against petitioner
corporation, Virgilio Dulay and Nepomuceno Redovan, a tenant of Dulay Apartment
Unit No. 8­-A for the recovery of possession, sum of money and damages with
preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. 8198-P with the then Court of First
Instance of Rizal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 21, 1980, petitioner corporation filed an action against
private respondents spouses Veloso and Torres for the cancellation of the

Apartment Unit No. 7-B, with petitioner corporation as intervenor for ejectment

2880-P.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the three (3) cases were jointly tried and the trial
court rendered a decision in favor of private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with said decision, petitioners appealed to the
Court of Appeals which rendered a decision on October 23, 1989, the dispositive
portion of which reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision being appealed should be as
it is hereby AFFIRMED in full."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 8, 1989, petitioners filed a Motion for
Reconsideration which was denied on January 26, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the pendency of this petition, private respondent Torres
died on April 3, 1991 as shown in his death certificate<a style="mso-footnote-id:

dated October 31, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that the respondent court had acted with
grave abuse of discretion when it applied the doctrine of piercing the veil of
corporate entity in the instant case considering that the sale of the subject
property between private respondents spouses Veloso and Manuel Dulay has no
binding effect on petitioner corporation as Board Resolution No. 18 which
authorized the sale of the subject property was resolved without the approval
of all the members of the board of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">directors
and said Board Resolution was prepared </span>by a person not designated by the
corporation to be its secretary.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 101 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 101.  When board
meeting is unnecessary or improperly held.  Unless the by-laws provide otherwise, any action by the directors of a
close corporation without a meeting shall nevertheless be deemed valid if:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.  Before or after such action is taken,
written consent thereto is signed by all the directors; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  All the stockholders have actual or implied
knowledge of the action and make no prompt objection thereto in writing; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  The directors are accustomed to take
informal action with the express or implied acquiesce of all the stockholders;
or</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.  All the directors have express or implied knowledge
of the action in question and none of them makes prompt objection thereto in
writing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If a directors' meeting is held without proper call or
notice, an action taken therein within the corporate powers is deemed ratified
by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">a </span>director who failed to
attend, unless he promptly files his written objection with the secretary of
the corporation after having knowledge thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, petitioner corporation is classified as a
close corporation and consequently a board resolution authorizing the sale or
mortgage of the subject property is not necessary to bind the corporation for
the action of its president.  At any
rate, a corporate action taken at a board meeting without proper call or notice
in a close corporation is deemed ratified by the absent director unless the
latter promptly files his written objection with the secretary of the
corporation after having knowledge of the meeting which, in this case,
petitioner Virgilio Dulay failed to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is relevant to note that although a corporation is an entity
which has a personality distinct and separate from its individual stockholders
or members,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
the veil of corporate fiction may be pierced when it is used to defeat public
convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The privilege of being treated as an entity distinct and separate from its
stockholders or members is therefore confined to its legitimate uses and is
subject to certain limitations to prevent the commission of fraud or other
illegal or unfair act.  When the corporation
is used merely as an alter ego or business conduit of a person, the law will
regard the corporation as the act of that person.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The Supreme Court had repeatedly disregarded the separate personality of the
corporation where the corporate entity was used to annul a valid contract
executed by one of its members.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' claim that the sale of the subject property by its
president, Manuel Dulay, to private respondents spouses Veloso is null and void
as the alleged Board Resolution No. 18 was passed without the knowledge and
consent of the other members of the board of directors cannot be
sustained.  As correctly pointed out by
the respondent Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant Virgilio E. Dulay's protestations of complete
innocence to the effect that he never participated nor was even aware of any
meeting or resolution authorizing the mortgage or sale of the subject premises
(see par. 8, affidavit of Virgilio E. Dulay, dated May 31, 1984, p. 14, Exh.
"21") is difficult to believe.  On the contrary, he is very much privy to the transactions
involved.  To begin with, he is an
incorporator and one of the board of directors designated at the time of the
organization of Manuel R. Dulay Enterprises, Inc.  In ordinary parlance, the said entity is loosely referred to as a
'family corporation'.  The nomenclature,
if imprecise, however, fairly reflects the cohesiveness of a group and the
parochial instincts of the individual members of such an aggrupation of which
Manuel R. Dulay Enterprises, Inc. is typical:  four-fifths of its incorporators being close relatives namely, three (3)
children and their father whose name identifies their corporation (Articles of
Incorporation of Manuel R. Dulay Enterprises, Inc., Exh.
"31-A")."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the fact that petitioner Virgilio Dulay on June 24, 1975
executed an affidavit<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> that
he was a signatory witness to the execution of the post-dated Deed of Absolute
Sale of the subject property in favor of private respondent Torres indicates
that he was aware of the transaction executed between his father and private
respondents and had, therefore, adequate knowledge about the sale of the
subject property to private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, petitioner corporation is liable for the act of
Manuel Dulay and the sale of the subject property to private respondents by
Manuel Dulay is valid and binding.  As
stated by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x the sale between Manuel R. Dulay Enterprises, Inc. and
the spouses Maria Theresa V. Veloso and Castrense C. Veloso, was a corporate
act of the former and not a personal transaction of Manuel R. Dulay.  This is so because Manuel R. Dulay was not
only president and treasurer but also the general manager of the
corporation.  The corporation was a
closed family corporation and the only non-relative in the board of directors
was Atty. Plaridel C. Jose who appeared on paper as the secretary.  There is no denying the fact, however, that
Maria Socorro R. Dulay at times acted as secretary x x x, the Court can not
lose sight of the fact that the Manuel R. Dulay Enterprises, Inc. is a closed
family corporation where the incorporators and directors belong to one single
family.  It cannot be concealed that
Manuel R. Dulay as president, treasurer and general manager almost had absolute
control over the business and affairs of the corporation."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the appellate courts will not disturb the findings of
the trial judge unless he has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and
value that, if considered, might affect the result of the case,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
which is not present in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention that private respondent Torres never
acquired ownership over the subject property since the latter was never in
actual possession of the subject property nor was the property ever delivered to
him is also without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 1, Article 1498 of the New Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>“When the sale is made through a public instrument, the execution
thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the object of
the contract, if from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly
be inferred.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the aforementioned article, the mere execution of the deed
of sale in a public document is equivalent to the delivery of the
property.  Likewise, this Court had held
that:</p>

<blockquote>“It is settled that the buyer in a foreclosure sale becomes the
absolute owner of the property purchased if it is not redeemed during the
period of one year after the registration of the sale.  As such, he is entitled to the possession of
the said property and can demand it at any time following the consolidation of
ownership in his name and the issuance to him of a new transfer certificate of
title.  The buyer can in fact demand
possession of the land even during the redemption period except that he has to
post a bond in accordance with Section 7 of Act No. 3133 as amended.  No such bond is required after the
redemption period if the property is not redeemed.  Possession of the land then becomes an absolute right of the
purchaser as confirmed owner.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, prior physical delivery or possession is not legally
required since the execution of the Deed of Sale is deemed equivalent to
delivery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we hold that the respondent appellate court did not err
in denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration despite the fact that
private respondents failed to submit their comment to said motion as required
by the respondent appellate court.  There is nothing in the Revised Rules of Court which prohibits the
respondent appellate court from resolving petitioners' motion for
reconsideration without the comment of the private respondent which was
required merely to aid the court in the disposition of the motion.  The courts are as much interested as the
