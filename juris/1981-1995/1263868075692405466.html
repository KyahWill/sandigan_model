				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For the taxable year 1974 ending on 30 June 1974, and the taxable
year 1975 ending 30 June 1975, private respondent Procter and Gamble Philippine
Manufacturing Corporation ("P&amp;G-Phil.") declared dividends
payable to its parent company and sole stockholder, Procter and Gamble Co., <span style="">Inc. (USA) ("P&amp;G-USA"),
amounting to P24,164,946.30, from </span>which dividends the amount of
P8,457,731.21 representing the thirty-five percent (35%) withholding tax at
source was deducted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 5 January 1977, private respondent P&amp;G-Phil. filed with
petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue a claim for refund or tax credit in
the amount of P4<span class="GramE">,832,989.26</span> claiming, among other
things, that pursuant to Section 24 (b) (1) of the National Internal Revenue
Code ("NIRC"),<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as amended by Presidential Decree No. 369, the applicable rate of withholding
tax on the dividends remitted was only fifteen percent (15%) (<span class="GramE">and</span> not thirty-five percent [35%]) of the dividends.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no responsive action <span style="">on </span>the part of the Commissioner, P&amp;G-Phil., on <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="7">13 July 1977</st1:date>, filed a petition for
review with public respondent Court of Tax Appeals ("CTA") docketed
as CTA Case No. 2883.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="1">31 January 1984</st1:date>, the CTA rendered <span style="">a </span>decision
ordering petitioner Commissioner to refund or grant the tax credit <span style="">in </span>the amount of P4<span class="GramE">,832,989.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by the Commissioner, the Court through its Second
Division reversed the decision of the CTA and held that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b) <span style="">&nbsp;</span>"there is nothing in Section 902 or other
provisions of the US Tax Code that allows a credit against the US tax due from
P&amp;G-USA of taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to
twenty percent (20%) which represents the difference between the regular tax of
thirty-five percent (35%) on corporations and the tax of fifteen percent (15%)
on dividends;" and<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

P&amp;G-Phil. failed to meet certain conditions necessary in order that
"the dividends received by its non-resident parent company in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(P&amp;G-USA) may be subject to the preferential tax rate of 15% instead of
35%."</p>

<p class="BODY">These holdings were questioned in P&amp;G-<span class="SpellE">Phil.'s</span>
Motion for Reconsideration and we will deal with them <u><span style="">seriatim</span></u><span style=""> </span>in this Resolution resolving that Motion.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are certain preliminary aspects of the
question of the capacity of P&amp;G-Phil. to bring the present claim for refund
or tax credit, which need to be examined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This question was raised for the first time on appeal, i.e., in the
proceedings before this Court on the Petition for Review filed by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question was <u>not</u> raised by the Commissioner on the administrative level,
and neither was it raised by him before the CTA.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the Bureau of Internal Revenue ("BIR")
should not be allowed to defeat an otherwise valid claim for refund by raising
this question of alleged incapacity for the first time on appeal before this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly a matter of procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner does not pretend that
P&amp;G-Phil., should it succeed in the claim for refund, is likely to run
away, as it were, with the refund instead of transmitting such refund or tax
credit to its parent and sole stockholder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is commonplace that in the absence of explicit statutory provisions
to the contrary, the government must follow the same rules of procedure which
bind private parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, for
instance, clear that the government is held to compliance with the provisions
of Circular No. 1-88 of this Court in exactly the same way that private
litigants are held to such compliance, save only in respect of the matter of
filing fees from which the Republic of the Philippines is exempt by the Rules
of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, there arises here a question of fairness should
the BIR, unlike any other litigant, be allowed to raise for the first time on
appeal questions which had not been litigated either in the lower court or on
the administrative level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, if
petitioner had at the earliest possible opportunity, i.e., at the
administrative level, demanded that P&amp;G-Phil. produce an express authoriza­tion
from its parent corporation to bring the claim for refund, then P&amp;G-Phil.
would have been able forthwith to secure and produce such authorization before
filing the action in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The action here was commenced just before <span style="">expiration </span>of the two (2)-year prescriptive period.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of the capacity of
P&amp;G-Phil. to bring the claim for refund has substantive dimensions as well <span style="">which, as will be seen below, also ultimately
relate to fairness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 306 of the NIRC, a claim for refund or tax credit
filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is essential for maintenance of
a suit for recovery of taxes allegedly erroneously or illegally assessed or
collected:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 306.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Recovery of tax erroneously or illegally
collected</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- <u>No suit or
proceeding shall be maintained in any court</u> for the recovery of any
national internal revenue tax hereafter alleged to have been erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been
collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in
any manner wrongfully collected, <u>until a claim for refund or credit has been
duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue</u>; but such suit or proceeding
may be maintained, whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under
protest or duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, no such
suit or proceed­ing shall be begun after the expiration of two years from the
date of payment of the tax or penalty regardless of any supervening cause that
may arise after payment: x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 309 (3) of the NIRC, in turn,
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section

in writing</u> with the Commissioner <u>a claim for credit or refund</u> within
two (2) years after the payment of the <span style="">tax
or penalty." (As amended by P.D. No. 69) (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since the claim for refund was filed by
P&amp;G-Phil., the question which arises is: is P&amp;G-Phil. a "<u>taxpayer</u>"
under Section 309 (3) of the NIRC?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
term "<u>taxpayer</u>" is defined in our NIRC as referring to "<u>any
person subject to tax </u>imposed by the Title [on Tax on Income]."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It thus becomes important to note that under Section 53 (c) of the <span style="">NIRC, </span>the withholding agent who is
"required to deduct and withhold any tax" is made "<u>personally
liable for such tax</u>" and indeed is indemnified against any claims and
demands which the stockholder might wish to make in questioning the amount of
payments effected by the withholding agent in <span style="">accordance with the provisions </span>of the NIRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The withholding agent, P&amp;G-Phil., is <u>directly
and independently liable</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></u></span></a>
for the correct amount of the tax that should be withheld from the dividend
remittances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The withholding agent is,
moreover, subject to and liable for deficiency assessments, surcharges and
penalties should the amount of the tax withheld be finally found to be less
than the amount that should have been withheld under law.</p>

<p class="BODY">A "person liable for tax" has been held to be a
"person subject to tax" and properly considered a
"taxpayer."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The terms "liable for tax" and "subject to tax" both
connote legal obligation or duty to pay a tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is very difficult, indeed conceptually impossible, to consider a
person who is statutorily made "liable for tax" as <u>not</u>
"subject to <span style="">tax." </span>By any
reasonable standard, such a person should be regarded as a party in <span class="GramE">interest,</span> or as a person having sufficient legal interest,
to bring a suit for refund of taxes he believes were illegally collected from
him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Philippine </u><u><span style="">Guaranty
</span>Company, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court pointed out that a withholding <span style="">agent
</span>is in fact the agent both of the government <span style="">and of</span> the taxpayer, and that the withholding agent is not an
ordinary government agent:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>The law sets no condition for the personal liability of
the withholding agent to attach</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason is to compel the withholding agent to<span style=""> withhold the tax under all circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the responsibility for the
collection of the tax as well as the payment thereof is concentrated upon the
person over whom the Govern­ment has jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <u>the withholding agent </u></span><u>is
</u><u><span style="">constituted the agent of both
the Government and the taxpayer</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the collection and/or
withholding of the tax, he is the Government's agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In regard to the filing of the necessary
income tax return and the payment of the tax to the Government, he is the agent
of the taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The withholding agent,
therefore, is no ordinary government agent especially because under Section 53
(c) he is held personally liable for the tax he is duty bound to withhold;
whereas the Commissioner and his deputies are not made liable by law</u>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (Emphases supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">If, as pointed out in <u>Philippine
Guaranty</u>, the withholding agent is also an agent of the beneficial owner of
the dividends with respect to the filing of the necessary income tax return and
with respect to actual payment of the tax to the government, such authority may
reasonably be held to include the authority to file a claim for refund and to
bring an action for recovery of such claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This implied authority is especially warranted where, as in the instant
case, the withholding agent is the <u>wholly owned subsidiary of the
parent-stockholder</u> and therefore, <u>at all times, under the effective
control of such parent-stockholder</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the circumstances of this case, it seems particularly unreal to deny
the implied authority of P&amp;G-Phil. to claim a refund and to commence <span style="">an </span>action
for such refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that, even now, there is nothing to preclude the BIR
from requiring P&amp;G-Phil. to show some written <span style="">or </span>telexed confirmation by P&amp;G-USA of the subsidiary's
authority to claim the refund or tax credit and to remit the proceeds of the
refund, or to apply the tax credit to some Philippine tax obligation of
P&amp;G-USA, <u>before actual payment of the refund or issuance of a tax credit
certificate</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What appears to be
vitiated by basic unfairness is petitioner's position that, although
P&amp;G-Phil. is directly and personally liable to the Government for the taxes
and any deficiency assessments to be collected, the Government is not legally
liable for <span style="">a
</span>refund simply because it did not demand a written confirmation of
P&amp;G-<span class="SpellE">Phil.'s</span> implied authority from the very
beginning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sovereign government should
act honorably and fairly at all times, even <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span>
taxpayers.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe and <span style="">so </span>hold
that, under the circumstances of this case, P&amp;G-Phil. is properly regarded
as a "taxpayer" within the meaning of Section 309, NIRC, and as
impliedly authorized to file the claim for refund and the suit to recover such
claim.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn to the principal substantive
question before us; the applicability to the dividend remittances by
P&amp;G-Phil. to P&amp;G-USA of the fifteen percent (15%) tax rate provided for
in the following portion of Section 24 (b)(1) of the NIRC:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(b)
<u>Tax on foreign corporations</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Non-resident corporation</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- A foreign corporation not engaged in trade
and business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, shall pay <span style="">a tax </span>equal
to 35% of the gross income receipt during its taxable year from <span style="">all </span>sources within the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
as x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> dividends x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, still further, that on
dividends received from a domestic corpora­tion liable to tax under this
Chapter, the tax shall be 15% of the dividends, which shall be collected and
paid <span style="">as </span>provided
in Section 53 (d) of this Code, subject to the condition that the country in
which the non-resident foreign corporation <span style="">is </span>domiciled shall allow a credit
against the tax due from the non-resident foreign corporation, taxes deemed to
have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to 20% which represents the
difference between the regular tax (35%) on corporations and the tax (15%) on
dividends as provided in this Section <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ordinary thirty-five percent (35%) tax rate applicable to
dividend remittances to non-resident corporate stockholders of a Philippine
corporation, goes down to fifteen percent (15%) if the country of domicile of
the foreign stockholder corporation "shall allow" such foreign
corporation a tax credit for "taxes deemed paid in the Philippines,"
applicable against the tax payable to the domiciliary country by the foreign
stockholder corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
in the instant case, the reduced fifteen <span style="">percent
</span>(15%) dividend tax rate is applicable if the USA "shall allow"
to P&amp;G-USA a tax credit for "taxes deemed paid in the
Philippines" applicable against the US taxes of P&amp;G-USA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NIRC specifies that such tax credit for
"taxes deemed paid in the Philippines" must, as a minimum, reach an <span style="">amount equivalent </span>to twenty (20)
percentage points which represents the difference between the regular
thirty-five percent (35%) dividend tax rate and the preferred fifteen percent
(15%) dividend tax rate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to <span style="">note </span>that
Section 24 (b)(1), <span style="">NIRC, </span>does <u>not</u>
require that the <span style="">US </span>must give a
"<u>deemed paid" tax credit for the dividend tax (20 percentage
points) waived by the Philippines</u> in making applicable the preferred
dividend tax rate of fifteen percent (15%).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, our NIRC does <u>not</u> require that the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> </span>tax law <u>deem the parent?corporation
to have paid the twenty (20) percentage points of dividend tax waived</u> by

amount equivalent to the twenty (20) percentage points</u> waived by the Philippines.</p>

rate or the reduced fifteen percent (15%) rate?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question of whether or not P&amp;G-USA is in fact given by the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
tax authorities a "deemed paid" tax credit in the required amount,
relates to the administrative implementation of the applicable reduced tax
rate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, Section 24 (b)(1), NIRC, does <u>not</u> in
fact require that the "deemed paid" tax credit shall have actually
been granted <u>before</u> the applicable dividend tax rate goes down from
thirty-five percent (35%) to fifteen percent (15%).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted several times earlier, Section 24
(b)(1), NIRC, merely requires, in the case at bar, that the USA <span style="">"<u>shall allow</u> </span>a credit
against the tax due from [P&amp;G-USA for] taxes deemed to have been paid in
the Philippines <span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span>." There is
neither statutory provision nor revenue regulation issued by the Secretary of
Finance requiring the actual grant of the "deemed paid" tax credit by
the US Internal Revenue Service to P&amp;G-USA before the preferential fifteen
percent (15%) dividend rate becomes applicable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 24 (b<span class="GramE">)(</span>1), NIRC, does not create <span style="">a tax </span>exemption
nor does it provide a tax credit; <u>it is </u><u><span style="">a </span>provision which specifies when a
particular (reduced) tax rate is legally applicable</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In the third place, the position originally
taken by the Second Division results in a severe practical problem of
administrative circularity.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Second Division in effect held that the reduced dividend tax rate is not
applicable until the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
tax credit for "deemed paid" taxes is actually given <span style="">in </span>the required minimum amount by the
US Internal Revenue Service to P&amp;G-USA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, the <span style="">US
</span>"deemed paid" tax credit <u>cannot</u> be given by the US tax
authorities unless dividends have actually been remitted to the US, which means
that the Philippine dividend tax, at the rate here applicable, was actually
imposed and collected.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It is this practical or operating circularity that is in fact avoided by our
BIR when it issues rulings that the tax laws of particular foreign
jurisdictions (e.g., Republic of Vanuatu,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

etc.) comply with the requirements set out in Section 24 (b)(1), NIRC, for
applicability of the fifteen percent (15%) tax rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once such <span style="">a </span>ruling is rendered, the Philippine subsidiary begins to
withhold at the reduced dividend tax rate.</p>

<p class="BODY">A requirement relating to administrative implementation is not
properly imposed <span style="">as </span>a condition
for the <u><span style="">applicabi­lity, as a matter
of law</span></u><span style="">, </span>of a
particular tax rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, upon the determination or recognition of the applicability of the reduced
tax rate, there is nothing to prevent the BIR from issuing implementing
regulations that would require P&amp;G-Phil., or any Philippine corporation
similarly situated, to certify to the BIR the amount of the "deemed
paid" tax credit actually subsequently granted by the <span style="">US </span>tax authorities to P&amp;G-USA or a
US parent corporation for the taxable year involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the US tax laws can and do change, such
implementing regulations could also provide that failure of P&amp;G-Phil. to
submit such certification within a certain period of time, would result in the
imposition of a deficiency assessment for the twenty (20) percentage points
differential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The task of this Court is
to settle which tax rate is applicable, considering the state of <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>

administrative implementation where they properly belong -- with the BIR.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An interpretation of a
tax statute that produces a revenue flow for the government is not, for that
reason alone, necessarily the correct reading of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are many tax statutes or provisions
which are designed, not to trigger off an instant surge of revenues, but rather
to achieve longer-term and broader-gauge fiscal and economic objectives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The task of our Court is to give effect to the
legislative design and objectives as they are written into the statute even if,
as in the case at bar, some revenues have to be foregone in that process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The economic objectives sought to be achieved by the Philippine
Government by reducing the thirty-five percent (35%) dividend rate to fifteen
percent (15%) are set out in the <span class="SpellE">preambular</span> clauses
of P.D. No. 369 which amended Section 24 (b)(1), NIRC, into its present form:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">More simply put, Section 24 (b)(1), <span style="">NIRC, </span>seeks to promote the in-flow of
foreign equity investment in the Philippines by reducing the tax cost of
earning profits here and thereby increasing the net dividends remittable to the
investor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foreign investor, however,
would not benefit from the reduction of the Philippine dividend tax rate unless
its home country gives it some relief from double taxation (i.e., second-tier
taxation) (the home country would simply have more "post-R.P. tax"
income to subject to its own taxing power) by allowing the investor additional
tax credits which would be applicable against the tax payable to such home
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Section 24 (b)(1),
NIRC, requires the home or domiciliary country to give the investor corporation
a "deemed paid" tax credit at least equal in amount to the twenty
(20) percentage points of dividend tax foregone by the Philippines, in the
assumption that a positive incentive effect would thereby be felt by the
investor.</p>

<span style="">The following detailed examination of
the tenor and import of Sections 901 and 902 of the US Tax Code is,
regrettably, made necessary </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the fact that the original decision of the
Second Division overlooked those Sections in their entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the original opinion in 160 SCRA 560
(1988), immediately after Section 902, US Tax Code is quoted, the following
appears: "To Our mind, there is nothing in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
provision that would justify tax return of the disputed 15% to the private
respondent" (160 SCRA at 567).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
further discussion of Section 902 was offered.</span></p>

<span style="">In his dissenting opinion, <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, <u>J</u>. writes that "the amount of the tax
credit purportedly being allowed is not fixed or ascertained, hence we do not
know whether or not the tax credit contemplated is within the limits set forth
in the law" (Dissent, p. 6) Section 902 US Tax Code does not specify
particular fixed amounts or percentages as tax credits; what it does specify in
Section 902(A)(2) and (C)(1)(B) is a <u>proportion</u> expressed in the
fraction:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The actual or absolute amount of the tax credit allowed by Section 902
will obviously depend on the actual values of the numerator and the denominator
used in the fraction specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
point is that the establishment of the proportion or fraction in Section 902
renders the tax credit there allowed <u>determinate</u> and <u>determinable</u>.</span></p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> <span style="">The denominator used by Com. <span class="SpellE">Plana</span> is the
total pre-tax income of the Philippine subsidiary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 902 (c<span class="GramE">)(</span>1)(B),

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Concurring Opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BIDIN, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree with the opinion of my esteemed brother, Mr. Justice
Florentino P. Feliciano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I wish
to add some observations of my own, since I happen to be the <u><span style="">ponente</span></u><span style=""> in</span> <u>Commissioner</u> <u>of</u> <u>Internal</u> <u>Revenue</u> <u>v.</u>
<u>Wander</u> <u>Philippines,</u> <u>Inc.</u> (160 SCRA 573 [1988]), a case
which reached a conclusion that is diametrically opposite to that sought to be
reached in the instant Motion for Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. In page 5 of his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Edgardo L.
Paras argues that the failure of petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue to
raise before the Court of Tax Appeals the issue of who should be the real party
in interest in claiming <span style="">a </span>refund
cannot prejudice the government, as such failure is merely a procedural defect;
and that moreover, the government can never be in estoppel, especially in
matters involving taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a word, the
dissenting opinion insists that errors of its agents should not jeopardize the
government's position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above rule should not be taken absolutely and literally; if
it were, the government would never lose any litigation which is clearly not
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue involved here is not
merely one of procedure; it is also one of fairness; whether the government
should be subject to the same stringent conditions applicable to an ordinary
litigant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court had declared in
Wander:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x To allow a litigant to assume a different posture when
he comes before the court and challenge the position he had accepted at the
administrative level, would be to sanction a procedure whereby the Court --
which is supposed to review administrative determinations -- would not review,
but determine and decide for the first time, a question not raised at the
administrative forum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x" (160
SCRA at 566-577)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Had petitioner been forthright earlier and required from private
respondent proof of authority from its parent corporation, Procter and Gamble <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to prosecute the claim for refund, private respondent would doubtless have been
able to show proof of such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
any account, it would be rank injustice now at this late stage to require
petitioner to submit such proof.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. In page 8 of his dissenting opinion, Paras, <u>J</u>., stressed
that private respondent had failed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
to show the actual amount credited by the US government against the income tax
due from P &amp; G USA on the dividends received from private respondent; (2)
to present the 1975 income tax return of P &amp; G USA when the dividends were
received; and (3) to submit any duly authenticated document showing that the US
government credited the 20% tax deemed paid in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree with the main opinion of my colleague, Feliciano, <u>J</u>.,
specifically in page 23 <u>et</u> <u>seq</u>. thereof, which, as I understand
it, explains that the US tax authorities are unable to determine the amount of <span class="GramE">the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"</span>deemed
paid" credit to be given <span style="">P &amp; </span>G
USA <span style="">so </span>long as the numerator of
the fraction, i.e., dividends actually remitted by P &amp; G-Phil to P &amp; G
USA, is still unknown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated in other
words, until dividends have actually been remitted to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(which presupposes an actual imposition and collection of the applicable
Philippine dividend tax rate), the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
tax authorities cannot determine the "deemed paid" portion of the tax
credit sought by P &amp; G USA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
require private respondent to show documentary proof of its parent corporation
having actually received the "deemed paid" tax credit from the proper
tax authorities, would be like putting the cart before the horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only way of cutting through this (what
Feliciano, <span style="">J., </span>termed) "circularity"
is for our BIR to issue rulings (as they have been doing) to the effect that
the tax laws of particular foreign jurisdictions, e.g., USA, comply with the
requirements in our tax code for applicability of the reduced 15% dividend tax
rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the taxpayer can be
required to submit, within a reasonable period, proof of the amount of
"deemed paid" tax credit actually granted by the foreign tax
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Imposing such a resolutory
condition should resolve the knotty problem of circularity.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Page 8 of the dissenting opinion of Paras, <u>J</u>., further
declares that tax refunds, being <span style="">in </span>the
nature of tax exemptions, are to be construed <u><span style="">strictissimi</span></u><span style=""> <u>juris</u>
</span>against the person or entity claiming the exemption; and that refunds
cannot be permitted to exist upon "vague implications."</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the foregoing canon of construction, the
fundamental rule is still that a judge must ascertain and give effect to the
legislative intent embodied in a particular provision of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a statute (including a tax statute
reducing a certain tax rate) is clear, plain and free from ambiguity, it must
be given its ordinary meaning and applied without interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the dissenting opinion
of Paras, <u>J</u>., itself concedes that the basic purpose of Pres. Decree No.
369, when it was promulgated in 1975 to amend Section 24(b), [1] of the
National Internal Revenue Code, was "to decrease the tax liability"
of the foreign capital investor and thereby to promote more inward foreign
investment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same dissenting opinion
hastens to add, however, that the granting of a reduced dividend tax rate
"is premised on reciprocity."</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Nowhere in the provisions of P.D. No. 369 or in the National
Internal Revenue Code itself would one find reciprocity specified as a
condition for the granting of the reduced dividend tax rate in Section 24 (b),
[1], NIRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, where
the law-making authority intended to impose a requirement of reciprocity as a
condition for grant of a privilege, the legislature does so <u>expressly</u>
and <u>clearly</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, the
gross estate of non-citizens and non-residents of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
normally includes intangible personal property situated in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
for purposes of application of the estate tax and donor's <span style="">tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>However,
under Section 98 of the NIRC (as amended by P.D. 1457), no taxes will be
collected by the Philippines in respect of such intangible personal property if
the law or the foreign country of which the decedent was a citizen and resident
at the time of his death allows a similar exemption from transfer or death
taxes in respect of intangible personal property located in such foreign
country and owned by Philippine citizens not residing in that foreign country.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no statutory requirement of reciprocity imposed as a
condition for grant of the reduced dividend tax rate of 15%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, for the Court to impose such a
requirement of reciprocity would <span style="">be </span>to
contradict the basic policy underlying P.D. 369 which amended Section 24(b),
[1], NIRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P.D. 369 <span style="">was </span>promulgated in the effort to
promote the inflow of foreign investment capital into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A requirement of reciprocity, i.e., <span style="">a </span>requirement that the U.S. grant a
similar reduction of U.S. dividend taxes on remittances by the U.S. subsidiaries
of Philippine corporations, would assume <span style="">a
</span>desire on the part of the U.S. <span style="">and
</span>of the Philippines to attract the flow of Philippine capital <u>into</u>
<u>the</u> <u>U.S.</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
precisely <span class="GramE"><span style="">is</span></span><span style=""> </span>a capital <u><span style="">importing</span></u><span style="">, </span>and
<u>not</u> a capital exporting country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had surplus capital to export, it would not need to import foreign capital into
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, to require dividend tax
reciprocity from a foreign jurisdiction would be to actively encourage
Philippine corporations to invest outside the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which would be inconsistent with the notion of attracting foreign capital into
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">in </span>the first place.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, in page 15 of
his dissenting opinion, Paras, <u>J</u>., brings up the fact that:</p>

<blockquote>"Wander cited as authority a BIR ruling dated <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1977</st1:date>, which requires a
remittance tax of only 15%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere
fact that in this Procter and Gamble case, the BIR desires to charge 35%
indicates that the BIR ruling cited in Wander has been obviously discarded
today by the BIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, there has
been a change of mind on the part of the BIR."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out by Feliciano, <u>J</u>., in his main opinion, even
while the instant case was pending before the Court of Tax Appeals and this
Court, the administrative rulings issued by the BIR from 1976 until as late as
1987, recognized the "deemed paid" credit referred to in Section 902
of the U.S. Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To date, no
contrary ruling has been issued by the BIR.</p>

<p class="BODY">For all the foregoing reasons, private respondent's Motion for
Reconsideration should be granted and I vote accordingly.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Concurring OPINION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I </span>join Mr. Justice
Feliciano in his excellent analysis of the difficult issues we are now asked to
resolve.</p>

<p class="BODY">As I understand it, the intention of Section 24(b) of our Tax
Code is to attract foreign investors to this country by reducing their 35%
dividend tax rate to 15% if their own state allows them a deemed paid tax
credit at least equal in amount to the 20% waived by the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This tax credit would offset the tax payable
by them on their profits to their home state.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In effect, both the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the home state of the foreign investors reduce their respective tax
"take" of those profits and the investors wind up with more left in
their pockets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this arrangement,
the total taxes to be paid by the foreign investors may be confined to the 35%
corporate income tax and 15% dividend tax only, both payable to the
Philippines, with the US tax liability being offset wholly or substantially by
the US "deemed paid" tax credits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without this arrangement, the foreign investors will have to pay
to the local state (in addition to the 35% corporate income tax) a 35% dividend
tax and another 35% or more to their home state or a total of 70% or more on
the same amount of dividends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
circumstance, it is not likely that many such foreign investors, given the
onerous burden of the two-tier tax system, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., local state plus
home state, will be encouraged to do business in the local state.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded that the law will "not trigger off an instant
surge of revenue," as indeed the tax collectible by the Republic from the
foreign investor is considerably reduced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This may appear unacceptable to the superficial viewer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this reduction is in fact the price we
have to offer to persuade the foreign company to invest in our country and
contribute to our economic development.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The benefit to us may not be immediately available in instant revenues
but it will be realized later, and in greater measure, in terms of a more
stable and robust economy.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PARAS, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Second Division of this Court in the case of
"Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Procter &amp; Gamble Philippine
Manufacturing Corporation, et al.," G.R. No. 66838, promulgated on April 15,
1988 is sought to be reviewed in the Motion for Reconsideration filed by
private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Procter &amp; Gamble
Philippines (PMC-Phils., for brevity) assails the Court's findings that:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>private respondent (PMC-Phils.) is not a
proper party to claim the refund/tax credit;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there is nothing in Section 902 or other
provision of the US Tax Code that allows a credit against the U.S. tax due from
PMC-U.S.A of taxes deemed to have been paid in the Phils. equivalent to 20%
which represents the difference between the regular tax of 35% on corporations
and the tax of 15% on dividends;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>private respondent failed to meet certain
conditions necessary in order that the dividends received by the non­resident
parent company in the U.S. may be subject to the preferential 15% tax instead
of 35%." (pp. 200-201, Motion for Reconsideration)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's position is based principally on the
decision rendered by the Third Division of this Court in the case of
"Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Wander Philippines, Inc. and the
Court of Tax Appeals," G.R. No. 68375, promulgated likewise on April 15,
1988 which bears the same issues as in the case at bar, but held an apparent
contrary view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent advances
the theory that since the Wander decision had already become final and
executory it should be a precedent in deciding similar issues as in this case
at hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yet, it must be noted that the Wander decision had become final
and executory only by reason of the failure of the petitioner therein to file
its motion for reconsideration in due time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner received the notice of judgment on April 22, 1988 but filed a
Motion for Reconsideration only on June 6, 1988, or after the decision had
already become final and executory on May 9, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that entry of final judgment had
already been made on May 9, 1988, the Third Division resolved to note without
action the said Motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
therefore, the merits of the motion for reconsideration were not passed upon by
the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1987 Constitution provides that a doctrine or principle of
law previously laid down either <u>e­n</u> <u>banc</u> or in Division may be
modified or reversed by the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is now before this Court en banc and
the decision that will be handed down will put to rest the present controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that private respondent, as withholding agent, is
obliged by law to withhold and to pay over to the Philippine government the tax
on the income of the taxpayer, PMC-U.S.A. (parent company).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, such fact does not necessarily
connote that private respondent is the real party in interest to claim
reimbursement of the tax alleged to have been overpaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Payment of tax is an obligation physically
passed off by law on the withholding agent, if any, but the act of claiming tax
refund is a right that, in a strict sense, belongs to the taxpayer which is
private respondent's parent company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
role or function of PMC-Phils., as the remitter or payor of the dividend
income, is merely to insure the collection of the dividend income taxes due to
the Philippine government from the taxpayer, "PMC-U.S.A.," the non
resident foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business in the
Philippines, as "PMC-U.S.A." is subject to tax equivalent to thirty
five percent (35%) of the gross income received from "PMC-Phils." in
the Philippines "as...dividends..." (Sec. 24 [b], Phil. Tax
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a mere withholding agent of
the government and the real party in interest being the parent company in the
United States, private respondent cannot claim refund of the alleged overpaid
taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such right properly belongs to
PMC-U.S.A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore clear that as
held by the Supreme Court in a series of cases, the action in the Court of Tax
Appeals as well as in this Court should have been brought in the name of the
parent company as petitioner and not in the name of the withholding agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because the action should be brought
under the name of the real party in interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See Salonga v. Warner Barnes, &amp; Co., Ltd., 88 Phil. 125; Sutherland,
Code Pleading, Practice, &amp; Forms, p. 11; Ngo The Hua v. Chung Kiat Hua,
L-17091, Sept. 30, 1963, 9 SCRA 113, Gabutas v. Castellanes, L-17323, June 23,
1965, 14 SCRA 376; Rep. v. PNB, L-16485, January 30, 1945).</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 3, Sec. 2 of the Rules of court provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parties in
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Every action must be
prosecuted and defended in the name of the real party in interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All persons having an interest in the subject
of the action and in obtaining the relief demanded shall be joined as
plaintiffs. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>All persons who claim an
interest in the controversy or the subject thereof adverse to the plaintiff, or
who are necessary to a complete determination or settlement of the questions
involved therein shall be joined as defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that under the Internal Revenue Code the withholding
agent may be sued by itself if no remittance tax is paid, or if what was paid
is less than what is due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this,
Justice Feliciano claims that in case of an <u>overpayment</u> (or claim for
refund) the agent must be given the right to sue the Commissioner by itself
(that is, the agent here is also a real party in interest).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further claims that to deny this right
would be <u>unfair</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is <u>not</u>
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While payment of the tax due is an
OBLIGATION of the agent, the obtaining of a refund is a RIGHT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While every obligation has a corresponding
right (and <u>vice-versa</u>), the obligation to pay the complete tax has the
corresponding right of the government to demand the deficiency; and the right
of the agent to demand a refund corresponds to the government's duty to
refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the <u>obligation</u>
of the withholding agent to pay in full does not correspond to its <u>right</u>
to claim for the refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident
therefore that the real party in interest in this claim for reimbursement is
the principal (the mother corporation) and NOT the agent.</p>

<p class="BODY">This suit therefore for refund must be DISMISSED.</p>

<p class="BODY">In like manner, petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue's
failure to raise before the Court of Tax Appeals the issue relating to the real
party in interest to claim the refund cannot, and should not, prejudice the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is merely a procedural
defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic that the
government can never be in estoppel, particularly in matters involving
taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for example, the payment by
the tax-payer of income taxes, pursuant to a BIR assessment does not preclude
the government from making <u>further</u> assessments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The errors or omissions of certain
administrative officers should never be allowed to jeopardize the government's
financial position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Phil. Long Distance Tel. Co. v. Coll. of
Internal Revenue, 90 Phil. 674; Lewin v. Galang, L-15253, Oct. 31, 1960; Coll.
of Internal Revenue v. Ellen Wood McGrath, L-12710, L-12721, Feb. 28, 1961;
Perez v. Perez, L-14874, Sept. 30, 1960; Republic v. Caballero, 79 SCRA 179;
Favis v. Municipality of Sabongan, L­-26522, Feb. 27, 1963)</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the issue of whether PMC-U.S.A. is entitled under the
U.S. Tax Code to a United States Foreign Tax Credit equivalent to at least 20
percentage paid portion spared or waived as otherwise deemed waived by the
government, We reiterate our ruling that while <u>apparently</u>, a tax-credit
is given, there is <u>actually</u> nothing in Section 902 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code, as amended by Public Law 87-834 that would justify tax return of
the disputed 15% to the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is because the amount of tax credit purportedly being allowed is
not fixed or ascertained, hence we do not know whether or not the tax credit
contemplated is within the limits set forth in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the mathematical computations in
Justice Feliciano's separate opinion <u>appear</u> to be correct, the
computations suffer from a basic defect, that is, we have no way of knowing or
checking the figure used as premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view of the ambiguity of Sec. 902 itself, we can conclude that no real tax
credit was really intended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
interpretation of tax statutes, it is axiomatic that as between the interest of
multinational corporations and the interest of our <u>own</u> government, it
would be far better, in the absence of definitive guidelines, to favor the
national interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly pointed
out by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>" ...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the tax-sparing credit operates on dummy, fictional or phantom taxes,
being considered as if paid by the foreign taxing authority, the host country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the context of the case at bar,
therefore, the thirty five (35%) percent on the dividend income of PMC-U.S.A.
would be reduced to fifteen (15%) percent <u>if</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>only</u> <u>if</u>
reciprocally PMC-U.S.A.'s home country, the United States, not only <u>would</u>
<u>allow</u> against PMC-U.S.A’s U.S. income tax liability a foreign tax credit
for the fifteen (15%) percentage-point portion of the thirty five (35%) percent
Phil. dividend tax actually paid or accrued <u>but</u> <u>also</u> would allow
a foreign tax 'sparing' credit for the twenty (20%) percentage-point portion
spared, waived, forgiven or otherwise deemed as <u>if</u> <u>paid</u> by the
Phil. gov't. by virtue of the ‘tax credit sparing’ proviso of Sec. 24(b), Phil.
Tax Code." (Reply Brief, pp. 23-24; Rollo, pp. 239-240).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the U.S. foreign tax credit system operates <u>only</u>
on foreign taxes <u>actually</u> paid by U.S. corporate taxpayers, whether
directly or indirectly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere under a
statute or under a tax treaty, does the U.S. government recognize much less
permit any foreign tax credit for spared or ghost taxes, as in reality the U.S.
foreign-tax credit mechanism under Sections 901-905 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code does not apply to phantom dividend taxes in the form of dividend
taxes waived, spared or otherwise considered "as if" paid by any
foreign taxing authority, including that of the Philippine government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Beyond that, the private respondent failed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to show the actual amount credited by the
U.S. government against the income tax due from PMC-U.S.A. on the dividends
received from private respondent; (2) to present the income tax return of its
parent company for 1975 when the dividends were received; and (3) to submit any
duly authenticated document showing that the U.S. government credited the 20% tax
deemed paid in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tax refunds are in the nature of tax exemptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, they are regarded as in derogation
of sovereign authority and to be construed <u>strictissimi</u> <u>juris</u>
against the person or entity claiming the exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof is upon him who claims
the exemption in his favor and he must be able to justify his claim by the
clearest grant of organic or statute law …. and cannot be permitted to exist
upon vague implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Asiatic
Petroleum Co. v. Llanes, 49 Phil. 466; Northern Phil. Tobacco Corp. v. Mun. of
Agoo, La Union, 31 SCRA 304; Rogan v. Commissioner, 30 SCRA 968; Asturias Sugar
Central, Inc. v. Commissioner of Customs, 29 SCRA 617; Davao Light and Power
Co. Inc. v. Commissioner of Custom, 44 SCRA 122).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when tax exemption is claimed, it must
be shown indubitably to exist, for every presumption is against it, and a well
founded doubt is fatal to the claim (Farrington v. Tennessee &amp; Country
Shelby, 95 U.S. 679, 686; Manila Electric Co. v. Vera, L-29987, Oct. 22, 1975;
Manila Electric Co. v. Tabios, L-23847, Oct. 22, 1975, 67 SCRA 451).</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be remembered that the tax credit appertaining to
remittances abroad of dividend earned here in the Philippines was amplified in
Presidential Decree No. 369 promulgated in 1975, the purpose of which was to
"encourage more capital investment for large projects." And its
ultimate purpose is to decrease the tax liability of the corporation
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this granting of a preferential
right is premised on reciprocity, without which there is clearly a derogation
of our country's financial sovereignty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No such reciprocity has been proved, nor does it actually exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, it would be useful to bear
in mind the following observations:</p>

<p class="BODY">The continuing and ever-increasing transnational movement of
goods and services, the emergence of multinational corporations and the rise in
foreign investments has brought about tremendous pressures on the tax system to
strengthen its competence and capability to deal effectively with issues
arising from the foregoing phenomena.</p>

<p class="BODY">International taxation refers to the operationalization of the
tax system on an international level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
it is, international taxation deals with the tax treatment of goods and
services transferred on a global basis, multinational corporations and foreign
investments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the guiding philosophy behind international trade is free
flow of goods and services, it goes without saying that the principal objective
of <u>international</u> <u>taxation</u> is to see through this ideal by way of
feasible taxation arrangements which recognize each country's sovereignty in
the matter of taxation, the need for revenue and the attainment of certain
policy objectives.</p>

<p class="BODY">The institution of feasible taxation arrangements, however, is
hard to come by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with,
international tax subjects are obviously more complicated than their domestic
counter-parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the devise of
taxation arrangements to deal with such complications requires a welter of
information and data build-up which generally are not readily obtainable and
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, caution must be
exercised so that whatever taxation arrangements are set up, the same do not
get in the way of free flow of goods and services, exchange of technology,
movement of capital and investment initiatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">A cardinal principle adhered to in international taxation is the <u>avoidance</u>
<u>of</u> <u>double</u> <u>taxation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The phenomenon of double taxation (i.e., taxing an item more than once)
arises because of global movement of goods and services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Double taxation also occurs because of
overlaps in tax jurisdictions resulting in the taxation of taxable items by the
country of source or location (source or <u>situs</u> rule) and the taxation of
the same items by the country of residence or nationality of the taxpayer (<u>domiciliary</u>
or <u>nationality</u> principle).</p>

<p class="BODY">An item may, therefore, be taxed in full in the country of source
because it originated there, and in another country because the recipient is a
resident or citizen of that country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the taxes in both countries are substantial and no tax relief is offered, the
resulting double taxation would serve as a discouragement to the activity that
gives rise to the taxable item.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a way out of double taxation, countries enter into tax
treaties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A tax treaty<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is a bilateral convention (but may be made multilateral) entered into between
sovereign states for purposes of eliminating double taxation on income and
capital, preventing fiscal evasion, promoting mutual trade and investment, and
according fair and equitable tax treatment to foreign residents or nationals.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A more general way of mitigating the impact of double taxation is
to recognize the foreign tax either as a <u>tax</u> <u>credit</u> or an <u>item</u>
<u>of</u> <u>deduction</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether the recipient resorts to tax credit or deduction is dependent
on the tax advantage or savings that would be derived therefrom.</p>

<p class="BODY">A principal defect of the tax credit system is when low tax rates
or special tax concessions are granted in a country for the obvious reason of
encouraging foreign investments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
instance, if the usual tax rate is 35 percent but a concession rate accrues to
the country of the investor rather than to the investor himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To obviate this, a tax sparing provision may
be stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With tax sparing, taxes
exempted or reduced are considered as having been fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">By way of resume, We may say that the Wander decision of the Third
Division cannot, and should not result in the reversal of the Procter &amp;
Gamble decision for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Wander decision cannot serve as a
precedent under the doctrine of <u>stare</u> <u>decisis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was promulgated on the same day the
decision of the Second Division was promulgated, and while Wander has attained
finality this is simply because no motion for reconsideration thereof was filed
within a reasonable period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, said
Motion for Reconsideration was theoretically never taken into account by said
Third Division.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that <u>stare</u> <u>decisis</u> can
apply, We reiterate what a former noted jurist Mr. Justice Sabino Padilla aptly
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"More pregnant than anything
else is that the court shall be right." We hereby cite settled doctrines
from a treatise on Civil Law:</p>

<blockquote>"We adhere in our country to the doctrine of <u>stare</u> <u>decisis</u>
(let it stand, <u>et</u> <u>non</u> <u>quieta</u> <u>movere</u>) for reasons of
stability in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine,
which is really ‘adherence to precedents,' states that once a case has been
decided one way, then another case, involving exactly the same point at issue,

<blockquote>"Of course, when a case has been decided erroneously such an
error must not be perpetuated by blind obedience to the doctrine of <u>stare</u>
<u>decisis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No matter how sound a
doctrine may be, and no matter how long it has been followed thru the years,
still if found to be contrary to law, it must be abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle of <u>stare</u> <u>decisis</u>
does not and should not apply when there is a conflict between the precedent
and the law (Tan Chong v. Sec. of Labor, 79 Phil. 249).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While stability in the law is eminently to be desired, idolatrous
reverence for precedent, simply, as precedent, no longer rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More pregnant than anything else is that the
court shall be right (Phil., Trust Co. v. Mitchell, 59 Phil. 30)."</blockquote>

Philippines and Switzerland, a country with which we have a pending tax treaty;
our Procter &amp; Gamble case deals with relations between the Philippines and
the United States, a country with which we had no tax treaty, at the time the
taxes herein were collected.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wander cited as authority a BIR Ruling dated
May 19, 1977, which requires a remittance tax of only 15%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that in this Procter and Gamble
case the B.I.R. desires to charge 35% indicates that the B.I.R. Ruling cited in
Wander has been obviously discarded today by the B.I.R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, there has been a change of mind on
the part of the B.I.R.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wander imposes a tax of 15% without stating
whether or not reciprocity on the part of Switzerland exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident that without reciprocity the
desired consequences of the tax credit under P.D. No. 369 would be rendered
unattainable.</p>

credit deductible and other pertinent financial data have not been presented,
and therefore even were we inclined to grant the tax credit claimed, we find
ourselves unable to compute the proper amount thereof.</p>

There are two types of credit systems.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first, is the underlying credit system which requires the other
contracting state to credit not only the 15% Philippine tax into company
dividends but also the 35% Philippine tax on corporations in respect of profits
out of which such dividends were paid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Philippine corporation is assured of sufficient creditable taxes to
cover their total tax liabilities in their home country and in effect will no
longer pay taxes therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other type
provides that if any tax relief is given by the Philippines pursuant to its own
development program, the other contracting state will grant credit for the
amount of the Philippine tax which would have been payable but for such relief.</p>
