from the narration of facts of the appellants, their defense <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>mainly alibi. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>As held in People v. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>,
et al., G.R. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Nos. </span>79418-21, March
20, 1990, it is commonplace learning that alibi <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">is </span>a weak defense because it can be so easily manufactured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the positive testimony pinpointing
his direct participation in a killing, the accused must not only show that he
was at some other place at the time that the crime occurred but also that it
was physically <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">impossible for him to
have been at the scene of the crime </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">order to sustain his
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eswan</span> testified that he passed by the plaza where <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span> and some
other persons were drinking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rest of
the appellants testified that they were either in their respective houses or
fishing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact remains that the witnesses saw the accused appellants shoot,
stab, and gang-up on the victim, <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The positive testimony of the prosecution
witnesses who actually saw the incident at close range and who have no reason
at all to testify falsely against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
accused, established beyond reasonable doubt the culpability of the
latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The positive identification
established the guilt of the accused to a moral certainty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Besa</span>, G. R. No. 78899, March 22, 1990).</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants assail the trial court for giving credence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>the testimony of prosecution
witnesses, Joel <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Villaruel</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend
that their </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">testimonies were </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">inconsistent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said inconsistencies, </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
records show, are merely on collateral matters which are <span class="GramE">not
material nor</span> fatal to the prosecution's case (People v. Bautista, 148
SCRA 155 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they bolster
the truth that indeed these witnesses were present during the incident and in
the confusion, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">excitement and
horror </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of what they were
witnessing, cannot anymore accurately recount each little detail of the incident
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, et al., G. R. No. 72742, February
12, 1990) as when <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span> said Pedro <span class="SpellE">Eswan</span> stabbed the victim but when asked about the position
of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Eswan</span>, he could not recall it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence, as borne out by the records clearly manifests the
appellants' guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of kinship between prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span> and the victim <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>
has likewise been raised by the appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">records
which shows any improper motive on the part of the prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span> to testify falsely against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This court has time and again held that mere
relationship of the witnesses to the victim is not sufficient to affect their
credibility (People v. </span><span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, 147 SCRA 594
[1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>, 155 SCRA 133 [1987];
People v. <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>, 156 SCRA 242 [1986].</p>

<p class="BODY">Another issue raised by the accused-appellants is the trial
court's finding that they acted in confederacy with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> contends
that he could not have conspired with the rest even if he shot <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span> since there is no evidence that he participated in
the ganging up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pedro and <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> for their part contend <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">that they could not have agreed to kill <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>
prior to the ganging up as they were dancing in the plaza.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their only objective for ganging up on <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>, as they claim, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is</span> to defend the life of <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The arguments of the accused-appellants are not meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts, as gathered from the records,
establish conspiracy and community of purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>First, the appellants were all at the scene of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">When <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> was being arrested, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
intervened and pushed and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the latter shot <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> </span>shot <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Pajimola</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> in return.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> and Carlos, on the other hand took turns in stabbing
<span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span> until he was lifeless, <span class="SpellE">afterwhich</span>,
they fled together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these acts
demonstrate community of purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
synchronized their actions towards the same objective which was the liquidation
of the victim x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (People
v. Tan, et al., G.R. No. 75530, December 19, 1989).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"Direct evidence is not necessary to prove conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be inferred from acts indicating
concerted action or community of purpose x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">To repeat the established doctrine, where the accused move in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">concert toward a common purpose, conspiracy
may be inferred from their joint acts and design, without need of direct
evidence of the criminal agreement xxx.”</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> (People v. Asuncion and <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, G.R. No.
83870, November 14, 1989 citing People v. Rojas, 147 SCRA 169).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants further question the trial court's failure
to appreciate the justifying circumstance of defense of relative in favor of <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>, and Pedro; <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> being a brother of <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
and Pedro, and <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> being a nephew of <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">They contend that the elements for appreciating the defense of
relative are present-that there was unlawful aggression on the part of <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>, when he shot <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that it was <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> who fired a shot which <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>,
as police officer, investigated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
likewise <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> who first committed a felony by
stabbing <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only fired his gun
after he was stabbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had to defend
himself from his assailants as he was alone in contrast to the
accused-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the instance when
<span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span> fired his gun, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
shot him three times, <span class="SpellE">afterwhich</span>, the other
appellants took turns in </span>stabbing <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above circumstances, it cannot be concluded that <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span> was the aggressor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">doing his duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was assigned to maintain order during the
dance at the public plaza.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> further claims that he employed
reasonable means to prevent his brother from being killed and he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">used the gun to shoot at <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>
as it was the only one available then.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> and Pedro, on the other hand,
claim that they both acted on the belief that <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
was the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot appreciate the justifying circumstance of defense of
relative in favor of the accused-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was no necessity at all of defending the brother since his life
was not actually in danger (People v. <span class="SpellE">Lingatong</span>, G.R.
No. 34019, January 29, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the </span>other hand,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">we </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">agree </span>with appellants that the affidavit of Carlos Castro, Jr.
is inadmissible in evidence on account of the absence of a counsel during its
preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, there <span class="GramE">are</span> other independent evidence pointing to him as one of the
assailants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was directly implicated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>having stabbed the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, we find no cogent reason to overturn the trial court's
finding of guilt of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
one, <span class="SpellE">Villaruel's</span> testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">jibes </span>with the doctor's testimony and his autopsy findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, there were several antagonists
against <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pajimola</span>
was the one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who was first
attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the victim fired his
gun only in self-defense considering that he was already wounded </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the assailants were many.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Once more, we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">apply </span>the
oft-repeated rule that this Court will not disturb the findings of the trial
judge unless he has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value
that, if considered, might <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">affect the
result of the case (People v. Javier, G.R. No. 77756, March 26, 1990; People v.
Miranda, G.R. No. 78900, March 21, 1990).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no such showing in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as William Navarro and <span class="SpellE">Egod</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> are concerned, the trial court never acquired
jurisdiction over them and, therefore, it can neither convict nor exculpate
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>References in the judgment as to
them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">are pure obiter with no binding
effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the judgment appealed from
