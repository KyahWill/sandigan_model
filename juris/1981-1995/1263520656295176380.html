				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two petitions for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction
are taken up jointly as they involve the same parties and arise from the same
causes.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 64152 is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with
preliminary injunction seeking to annul the resolution of respondent National
Labor Relations Commission dated April 29, 1983 affirming the resolution of
Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Dogelio</span>
which ordered the petitioner transportation company to reinstate private
respondent Francisco <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> to his position as
driver of an <span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span> bus without loss of
seniority rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC also affirmed
the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> at P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
per month from November, 1980 to <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1982</st1:date> and of such other benefits provided by the collective
bargaining agreement including leave privileges and P3.00 general increase for
the period but deleted the award of P50,000.00 for moral and actual damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 64249 is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> which seeks to annul the portion of the same
resolution of respondent National Labor Relations Commission deleting the award
of moral and actual damages in the amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have decided to give due course to the interrelated petitions,
treat the respondents' comments as answers, and consider the cases submitted
for decision without requiring the filing of briefs or memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> was employed as bus
driver on <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1971</st1:date> by
<span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> North Express, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1979, he was assigned to drive one of <span class="SpellE">Pantranco's</span> <span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span>
passenger buses at the higher compensation of more than P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
a month on commission basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Costales</span> was suspended for fourteen (14) days on
account of his violation of company rules and regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the 14-day suspension, he reported for
work but was told that he would be driving an ordinary passenger bus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Costales</span> asked for
a reconsideration of the order but this was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> filed a
complaint with the Ministry of Labor and Employment for "Illegal
Suspension and Demotion/Reduction of Wages" docketed as NCR Case No.
AB-11-9097-80 entitled "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> North Express, Inc." On <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1981</st1:date>, Labor Arbiter Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Linsangan</span> dismissed the complaint holding that the penalty
of suspension for fourteen (14) days and transfer from an <span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span>
bus to a non-<span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span> bus imposed upon
complainant <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> is just and reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Costales</span> appealed
to the National Labor Relations Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1982</st1:date>,
the National Labor Relations Commission referred the case back to the parties
for proper disposition under the grievance machinery of their collective
bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> and
the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> Employees Association (PTGWO) on <st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1982</st1:date> filed another complaint
for "Illegal Dismissal, <span class="SpellE">Backwages</span>,
Reinstatement, Benefits, Damages and Attorney's fees with legal interest"
against <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> docketed as NCR Case No. 8-5218-82.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint for illegal dismissal was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1982</st1:date> before Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Dogelio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the complainant requested for a
re-setting to enable them to file a position paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> was given
up to <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1982</st1:date> to
file its position paper and thereafter the Labor Arbiter gave the parties up to
<st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1982</st1:date> within
which to file all subsequent pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> failed to file its position paper on <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1982</st1:date>,
Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Dogelio</span>
rendered his decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>ordering respondent to reinstate complainant

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">ordering</span> respondent

leave privileges and the P3.00 general wage increase for the period;</blockquote>

average monthly earning and of being paid on commission basis."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1982</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> appealed to the National Labor Relations
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1983</st1:date>, respondent NLRC rendered a
decision affirming the decision of the labor arbiter but deleting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the award of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
for actual and moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> maintains that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> filed two different cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first on November, 1980 docketed as NCR
Case No. AB-11-9097-80 entitled "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Costales</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> North Express, Inc.", and the other
on August, 1982, docketed as NCR Case No. 8-5218-82 entitled "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> Employees
Association-PTGWO v. <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> North Express,
Inc." To sustain its arguments of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>, it argues that in both cases, the subject matter
is the same, i.e., the incident of <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="10">October
 22, 1980</st1:date>, which caused <span class="SpellE">Costales</span>' demotion
and suspension, and likewise in both cases, his causes of action are the same,
i.e., his alleged termination from employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contending that the decision of the NLRC in the first case on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1982</st1:date>, has already
become final, <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> states that the decision of
the NLRC in the second case was over a moot and academic issue.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Costales</span> on the other hand argues that
the resolution of respondent NLRC dated December 28, 1982 issued in connection
with the first complaint and which set aside the appeal and referred the case
back to the parties for proper disposition under the CBA grievance machinery
was not a final order or judgment on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He states that the second complaint docketed
as NCR Case No. 8-5218-82 was for illegal dismissal and damages whereas the
first complaint did not really question his dismissal as he had not yet been
terminated in his employment, hence, the subject matter and the cause of action
of the two complaints are not the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the above contentions of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Costales</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Rule 39 Section 49(b) of the Revised Rules of Court, the
settled rule has long been that for <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> to apply:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(a) the former judgment must be final; (b) it must have been rendered by
a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties; (c) it
must be a judgment on the merits; and (d) there must be, between the first and
the second actions, identity of parties, of subject-matter, and of cause of
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span>
v. Cardona, 70 Phil. 281)</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears quite clear that the issues raised in the second
complaint were not resolved by the first complaint for illegal suspension and
demotion/reduction of wages filed by <span class="SpellE">Costales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While there is identity of parties in both
the first and second complaints, there is a great deal of difference in their
causes of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In
NCR Case No.</span> AB-11-9097-80, the cause of action is the unlawful
suspension and demotion of <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> while in NCR Case
No. 8-5218-82, the cause of action is his unlawful dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suspension and demotion are different from
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the decision in the
first complaint when appealed to the NLRC was referred back to the parties for
proper disposition under the grievance procedure in their CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no judgment on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> further argues that it was
denied due process when despite the parties' agreement to submit their
respective pleadings on <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="10">October 22, <span class="GramE">1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> the labor arbiter
rendered his decision on <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="10">October 21,
 1982</st1:date>, or one day before the deadline for the submission of the
parties’ pleadings without any evidence on the part of the petitioner
transportation company.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Costales</span> on the other hand submits that
the petitioner was notified of the scheduled hearings and was present when they
were conducted and if the decision was rendered without <span class="SpellE">Pantranco's</span>
evidence, the fault was <span class="SpellE">Pantranco's</span> own failure to
comply with a legitimate order of the labor arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The due process argument of <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
is not sustained by the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
records show that the complaint for illegal dismissal in NCR Case No. 8-5218-82
was set for initial hearing on <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1982</st1:date> with notice that the parties should submit their
respective position papers and supporting affidavits at least three (3) days
before the scheduled hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
counsel for <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> appeared on <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1982</st1:date> but did not submit
any position paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was reset
for hearing to <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1982</st1:date>
at which date the complainants submitted their position paper but the case was
again reset to September 23 because <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> had not
as yet submitted its position paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1982</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> and the union submitted their supplemental
position paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> was submitted as his direct testimony in support
of the complaint for illegal dismissal but again <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
did not submit its position paper thus prompting the labor arbiter to consider
the case deemed submitted for resolution on the basis of evidence on
record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, the labor
arbiter allowed <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> another opportunity to be
heard when he gave another fifteen (15) days for the submission of the position
paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
failed to submit any pleading by <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="10">October
 12, 1982</st1:date> when the period expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the labor arbiter observed the cardinal
rules of administrative due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> was duly represented by counsel and was given
sufficient opportunity to be heard and to present its evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question refers to the amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
which may be awarded to <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> considering all the
background circumstances of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We find that <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> is not entirely without
fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by NLRC there is no
proof that <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> acted with malice or bad
faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first complaint for
illegal suspension, demotion, and reduction of wages, the labor arbiter
dismissed the complaint of <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> with a ruling
that the penalty of suspension and a transfer from <span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span>
buses to regular buses was just and reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This finding was not reversed on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The NLRC remanded the case to the parties on a showing that the
grievance machinery under the collective bargaining agreement had not been
followed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The decision of the labor arbiter in Case No.</span>
AB-11-9097-80 shows that <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> was caught by an
inspector re-issuing a used ticket and falsifying four passenger tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence was found overwhelming against <span class="SpellE">Costales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
decision was set aside not because of any doubts regarding the factual findings
but because prior resort to the grievance machinery in the CBA was a
jurisdictional requirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">It, therefore, appears that <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
was at fault when it ignored the provisions of the CBA grievance procedures and
was negligent or inattentive when the second case was being heard by the labor
arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Equitable considerations,
however, dictate that the decision of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Dogelio</span>
should not be upheld in all its dispositions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Costales</span></span><span class="GramE"> was</span> not a victim of arbitrary and high handed action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An award of one (1) year <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
is the most that appears to be just and reasonable under the circumstances of
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolutions of the labor arbiter as well as
that of the respondent Commission in G.R. No. 64152 are MODIFIED insofar as the
payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> is concerned and the petitioner
is ordered to pay private respondent his corresponding <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
for a period of one (1) year to be computed on the basis of his rate of
earnings from January to November, 1980 without qualification and
deduction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The questioned resolution of
the respondent Commission is affirmed in all other respects.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition in G.R. No. 64249 is DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
