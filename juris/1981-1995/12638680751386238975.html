Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-582 covering the properties described in

No. 10 and a portion of Lot No. 5 in order that a house may be constructed from
the proceeds thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was granted
by the Court and on August 31, 1951, Rosaura transferred ownership of the

Bartolome and/or his spouse can possess, occupy, or even lease the said
property in any manner and for whatever terms and conditions he or she deems
best, without the necessity of asking the prior consent of the plaintiffs or
anybody else, but should both spouses Ildefonso Bartolome and Adelaida Jaro
predecease the plaintiffs the subsequent income to be derived from the contract
of lease of the lot after the death of said spouses will already go to Rosabel

plaintiffs, their privies, executors, kins (sic), administrators and successors

</span>the property described in paragraph 1 of this compromise agreement will
revert to the ownership of the conjugal estate of the spouses Ildefonso
Bartolome and Adelaida Jaro, as when it was originally registered in their
names; and on the other hand, should Ildefonso Bartolome or his spouse sell or

the guilty party or parties would forfeit or lose his or her right to the
usufruct and other benefits stipulated in the paragraph 2 above;</p>

the foregoing agreements, the plaintiffs and the defendant waive and renounce
any further claim or counter-claim one may have against each other in the above
entitled case;’</p>

<blockquote>Pursuant to the said decision in Civil Case No. SP-642, the Court,
in the guardianship proceeding of incompetent Adelaida Jaro issued an order
excluding the lot covered by TCT No. T-663, then registered <span style="">in </span>the name of Rosaura, from the
inventory of the estate of Adelaida Jaro.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, TCT No. T-663 was cancelled and TCT No. 6215 was issued in
the names of Rosabel Banaag and Rowena Banaag.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Beginning June, 1949, Ildefonso Bartolome carried an extra-marital
relationship with Constancia Santiago, a widow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Out of this relationship, 4 children were born namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manuel, born on May 10, 1951; Estanislao,
born on September 28, 1952; Minerva Expedita, born on April 19, 1956; and
Peter, born on June 29, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
Adelaida Jaro’s death on January 8, 1968, Constancia Santiago, and her children
with Ildefonso Bartolome started residing in the house constructed on the lot
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-6215, now registered in the
names of Rosabel Banaag and Rowena Banaag.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the death of Ildefonso Bartolome on Feb. 22, 1972, several
demands to leave the premises were made on Constancia Santiago and her
children, by the Banaag family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only then that Constancia Santiago and her children found out about the Deed of
Absolute Sale executed between Maria Ambray and the spouses Ildefonso Bartolome
and Adelaide Jaro and the Deed of Absolute Sale executed between the said
spouses and their daughter, Rosaura Bartolome.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Shortly after,<span style=""> </span>on April 28,
1973, Constancia Santiago and her children by Ildefonso Bartolome
(plaintiffs-appellees in this case) brought a complaint to annul the Deed of
Absolute Sale executed between spouses Ildefonso Bartolome and Adelaida Jaro
and their daughter, Rosaura Bartolome.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Avelino Banaag, Rosabel, Banaag, and Rowena Banaag
(defendants-appellants in this case) filed a motion to dismies (sic) but the
Court denied it for lack of merit and ordered the plaintiffs to amend their
complaint to clarify their status -- whether Legitimate, acknowledged natural
children, or otherwise illegitimate children of the deceased Ildefonso
Bartolome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial on the merits was had
in due course.</blockquote>

of 13 October 1986, the Intermediate Appellate Court affirmed the lower court’s
judgment, making the following disquisitions:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it is true that by the lower court’s
decision in Civil Case No. SP-1105 it rendered the compromise judgment in Civil
Case No. SP-642 without effect, the lower court did not err in so deciding as
what was put in issue in the earlier case (Civil Case No. SP-642) was the
inclusion of the property in the inventory of the estate of Adelaida Jaro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of the contract of sale was not
passed upon in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
compromise agreement would not have been entered into had there been no
contract of sale between Rosaura Bartolome and her parents.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) The finding that
the sale is null and void for being simulated is well founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot Nos. 10 and 5-B were bought by the
spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>IIdefonso Bartolome and
Adelaida Jaro for P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three (3)
years later, the same lots were purchased by Rosaura for only P1<span style="">.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Not
only that, only two (2) years later, Rosaura herself, on behalf of her mother,
sold Lot No. 10 and a portion of Lot No. 5 for as much as P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While as a rule the law does not require for
validity of a sale that the price be adequate, it ordains that the price be
real and not fictitious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, "the inadequacy of price was so gross as to shock the conscience of
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The price was not merely inadequate
but fictitious and simulated."</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) Neither did the
lower court err in considering the house standing on Lot No. 5-B as part of the
conjugal property of the spouses Ildefonso Bartolome and Adelaida Jaro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants (petitioners) themselves admit
that the money used to construct said house came from the proceeds of the sale
of Lot No. 10 and a portion of Lot No. 5-B to YMCA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since said lots were undeniably purchased by
said <span style="">spouses during their marriage, and
thus are conjugal property, consequently, the subject house is conjugal
property.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4) The trial court
did not err in denying the motion to dismiss because, contrary to defendants'
(petitioners') contention, plaintiffs had capacity to sue notwithstanding
minority at the time of the filing of their complaint since they were duly
represented by their mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, they have successfully proven their status as acknowledged
spurious children of Ildefonso Bartolome through authentic writing as well as
testimonial evidence presented during the trial of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the plaintiffs had all the right to
question the validity of the contract of sale entered into by their father as
said land could have been passed on to them upon <span style="">his </span>death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nor could the complaint be dismissed on the ground that it failed
to state a cause of action in view of the fact that plaintiffs merely alleged
that they are children and heirs of Ildefonso Bartolome without any proof
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A complaint should not be
dismissed for insufficiency even if the allegations therein are ambiguous,
indefinite or uncertain if a cause of action can nonetheless be made out therefrom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, plaintiffs alleged that
they are children of Ildefonso Bartolome.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is obvious that if such claim is proven and the document sought to be
annulled is declared void, as was done by the trial court, the plaintiffs
(private respondents) have a right to inherit a portion of the property left by
their father.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">5)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anent the finding that plaintiff?appellees (private respondents)
are </span><u>acknowledged</u> spurious children of Ildefonso Bartolome, the
record of this case reveals that the decision of the trial court is supported
by both documentary and testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The testimonies of Carmen
Bartolome (sister of the late Ildefonso Bartolome), Constancia Santiago, and
Manuel Bartolome himself (one of the private respondents) indubitably show that
plaintiffs (private respondents) had been in continuous possession of the
status of illegitimate children of Ildefonso Bartolome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, documentary evidence on
record proved that Ildefonso Bartolome, during his lifetime, voluntarily recognized
the plaintiffs (private respondents) as his spurious children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These consist of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) report cards of private respondents with
the signature of Ildefonso found on the space provided at the back thereof for

respondents) were named as dependents and new beneficiaries; (3) Ildefonso’s
income tax return for 1968 wherein plaintiffs (private respondents) were listed
as his dependents; (4) Ildefonso’s statement of income and assets for 1969
wherein plaintiffs (private respondents) were listed as family members; (5) SSS
Form on distribution of death benefits wherein one?half (1/2) of the
death benefits was allotted to plaintiffs (private respondents); (6) the Deed
of Waiver executed by petitioner Avelino Banaag admitting plaintiffs (private

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second assigned error, petitioners assert that it was
erroneous for the court to declare the private respondents as recognized and
acknowledged illegitimate children of the late Ildefonso Bartolome when such a
declaration was not asked for.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, private respondents merely assumed and thereafter alleged
that they were duly acknowledged spurious children of Ildefonso Bartolome
without seeking the declaration of such status by a competent court as is
required.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
They contend further that both <span style="">the
lower court</span> and the appellate court erred <span style="">in </span>considering:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
report cards, SSS Form dated 11 August 1970 and the other documentary evidence
submitted as "authentic documents" in the light of Article 278 of the
New Civil Code; and (2) <span style="">that private </span>respondents
have been in continuous possession of the status of illegitimate children of
Ildefonso Bartolome as shown by the direct acts of the latter and his family.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Three <span style="">(3) </span>issues
are presented by this assignment of error:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) whether or not the trial court could properly declare private
respondents as recognized spurious children of Ildefonso Bartolome
notwithstanding their failure to ask for such declaration; (2) whether or not
the documents executed by Ildefonso Bartolome and presented in evidence are
authentic <span style="">writings which effectively
operate as a recognition of private respondents as his spurious children, even
if no action was brought by the latter to compel the former during his lifetime
to give such recognition; and (3) whether or not private respondents have been
in continuous possession of the status of illegitimate children </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Ildefonso Bartolome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As this case was
litigated and decided by the trial court prior to the effectivity of the Family
Code, the rights of the parties shall be determined in accordance with the law
then applicable, Book I of the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter provides two (2) modes of acknowledgment of illegitimate
issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) by voluntary recognition by
the putative parent made in the record of birth, a will, a statement before a
court of record or in an authentic writing under Article 278 of the Civil Code;
and (2) by compulsory recognition under the circumstances mentioned in Article
283 of the same law, which includes continuous possession of the status of a
child of the alleged father by the direct acts of the latter or his
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recognition is compulsory when
by court action, the child causes the putative parent to acknowledge his
filiation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also called judicial
recognition.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apparently, petitioners
have miscomprehended the complaint filed by private respondents </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Civil Case No. SP-1105, erroneously mistaking it to be one for
compulsory recognition of the latter as illegitimate children of Ildefonso
Bartolome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This accounts for their
insistence that the court erred in making such a declaration without private
respondents asking for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondents did not </span><span style="">ask </span><span style="">for such declaration because they were not
seeking to oblige their putative father to recognize them as his spurious
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, as shown in
their amended complaint, private respondents claim that they have already been
voluntarily recognized by Ildefonso Bartolome as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is by virtue of said voluntary recognition
that they </span>claim to have hereditary rights in the estate of Ildefonso
Bartolome, which allegedly includes the property subject of the <span style="">Deed of Sale sought to be annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with fundamental rules of
procedure, private respondents presented evidence in the course of the trial to
prove their allegations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly
therefore, the trial court could properly make a finding on whether said
allegations of private respondents are supported by </span><span style="">their </span><span style="">evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
