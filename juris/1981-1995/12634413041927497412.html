by the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Metro Manila, Branch 164 on February 26,
1990 in Criminal Cases Nos. 64831 and 78198 convicting Celestino Abapo of two <span style="">(2) </span>counts of murder.  The dispositive portion reads:</p>

<blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds the herein accused Celestino Abapo
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of murder on two counts as charged in Criminal
Case No. 64831 and Criminal Case No. 78198; and therefore, hereby imposes upon
him the penalty of life imprisonment for the death of Edgardo Bondoc in
Criminal Case No. 64831; and likewise imposes upon him another penalty of life
imprisonment for the death of Alfredo Raranga in Criminal Case No. 78193; as

<p class="BODY">On October 29, 1985, Celestino Abapo was charged with murder by
Assistant Fiscal Mariano M. Mendieta for the death of Edgardo Bondoc in an
information which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 13th of September, 1985, in the municipality
of Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, evident
premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously shoot one Edgardo Bondoc on the vital parts of his body, thereby
inflicting upon the latter gunshot wounds which directly caused his death.</blockquote>

Celestino Abapo for the death of Alfredo Raranga.  It reads:</p>

Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with Pistol Caliber Super .38,

willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot one Alfredo Raranga y Berbo between
his eyes with the said gun, thereby inflicting upon him mortal wounds which
directly caused his death.</blockquote>

Since the cases involved the same accused and both charges were for murder
although committed against different persons on different dates and places,
trial was conducted jointly without objections from either the prosecution or
the defense.  In this appeal, however,
we shall discuss the cases separately for clearer appreciation of the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Feliciana Bondoc Tagubanza, mother of victim Edgardo Bondoc,
testified that at about 1:30 in the afternoon of September 13, 1985, her son
asked for some loose change as he was going to see Pepito Reyes alias Totoy
Mata regarding a gun he had mortgaged to Pepito who had shown interest in
it.  Ever protective of her only son,
Feliciana Tagubanza followed him.  After
seeing him talk with Pepito, she went home.  Later, somebody came to their house and informed her that her son had
been killed.  She went to the scene of
the crime and found the employees of Funeraria Quiogue carrying the body of her
son.  According to Feliciana Tagubanza,
before his death, Edgardo told her that Celestino Abapo had confronted him in
Ubak, a place near their residence, and accused him (Edgardo) of killing his
(appellant) brother-in-law.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the time, sir, he came to see me to borrow some money because allegedly he
misappropriated the money collection for the dead (abuloy).</blockquote>

you give him the money he was requesting from you?</blockquote>

Tagubanza first shouted 'Brod, hindi tayo talo’ (at this juncture, witness

raised his right hand?</blockquote>

uttering the words ‘Brod, hindi tayo talo (Brod, we are not at odds).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. Arnaldo Tarroyo, criminal investigator of the Mandaluyong
Police Force, testified that he went to the scene of the crime and caused the
taking of three (3) photographs showing the victim<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>

He then requested the assistance of the employees of the Quiogue Funeral Parlor
in taking the cadaver to the <span style="">PC/INP </span>Crime
Laboratory for autopsy.  On September

and testified to by P/Lt. Filipinas Papa, medical technologist <span style="">of </span>the PC/INP Crime Laboratory
Services, Edgardo sustained five (5) gunshot wounds and two <span style="">(2) lacerated wounds.  The </span><span style="">wounds </span><span style="">which proved fatal

1985, stricken with influenza and diarrhea.  He was alone as his mother had gone to Taytay, his father-in-law and his
wife were at work and his children were in school.  At around 12:45 in the afternoon, Ruel Andrade (or Ondrade) came
to inquire whether or not the scheduled basketball game would push
through.  Appellant answered in the
negative and asked Ruel to bring his letter to <span style="">Sonny </span>Pangan, president of the JRC-Binangonan-Tanay Jeepney
Drivers' Association, requesting for a loan so that he could buy medicine.  Andrade did as requested and came back at
about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon with the medicine.  Andrade kept him company until appellant's
father-in-law arrived at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant's alibi was corroborated by Ruel Andrade.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred
in:  <span style="">(a) </span>convicting him on the basis of "conjecture and speculation
without certainty"; (b) believing the testimony of Pepito Reyes
notwithstanding the sworn statement of the victim's mother implicating Pepito
in the killing of her son; (c) convicting him of the crime of murder
"without the qualifying circumstances to aggravate the evil act", and
(d) not absolving him of the crime charged inspite of the failure of the
prosecution to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal is anchored on appellant's allegation that Pepito
Reyes, who was last seen by the victim's mother talking to her son, was the
most probable culprit.  The victim
allegedly had mortgaged a gun to Pepito who, upon learning that the victim was
about to get the gun, got <span style="">a </span>bodyguard in the person of Joe Bag.  To beef up this allegation, appellant relies heavily on the sworn
statement of Feliciana Tagubanza<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> that
Pepito and one alias Joe Bag had "something to do" with the killing
of her son ("may hinala po ako na iyong si Pepito Reyes alias Totoy Mata
at si alias Joe Bag ay may kinalaman sa pagkamatay ng aking anak")<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
and that when Pepito learned that Feliciana Tagubanza was linking him to the
death of her son, he created his own story and tagged appellant as the killer.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's theory deserves scant consideration as he did not
present any evidence to prove it in court.  Feliciana Tagubanza in fact testified that while she had some suspects
for the killing of her son, she knew that actually it was appellant ("Super
Tino") who should be held responsible for the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the principal prosecution witness, Pepito
Reyes, remained steadfast in his testimony that he witnessed how appellant
suddenly appeared while he was conversing with the victim and <span style="">that, even as the victim fled, appellant shot
him from behind.  Pepito could not have
been mistaken as to the identity of appellant as the assailant because he knew
him and the victim even before the incident.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> At the witness stand, he positively
identified appellant as Edgardo's assailant.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Such positive identification demolished
appellant's alibi that he was home afflicted with influenza and diarrhea when
the crime transpired.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Pepito was the sole eyewitness does not weaken the
strength of the prosecution's evidence.  The testimony of a single witness, free from any signs of impropriety or
falsehood, is sufficient to convict an accused, even if uncorroborated.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant's attack on the credibility of Pepito as a witness and the
evidentiary value of his testimony notwithstanding, such testimony has sealed
appellant's fate.  The judgment of the
trial court on the issue of credibility cannot be interfered with by this Court
unless there appears on the record some fact or circumstance of weight which has
been overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted.  The reason for this is that the trial court
is in a better position to decide the question of credibility having heard the
witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> The
defense has failed to prove that Pepito and his testimony are unworthy of
credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellant's claim, the trial court has proven that
treachery qualified the killing to murder.  The prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the victim was not <span style="">armed </span>when he was attacked.  The sudden appearance of the accused, armed
with a gun, did not give the victim any opportunity to defend himself.  The essence of treachery is the sudden and
unexpected attack without the slightest provocation on the part of the person
being attacked.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the victim apparently saw appellant and perceived his malevolent
intent when he cried, "Brod, hindi tayo talo!" does not rule out the
presence of treachery.  Even a frontal
attack can be treacherous when it is sudden and unexpected and the victim was
unarmed.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the unarmed victim was engaged in conversation with Pepito Reyes
when appellant suddenly appeared with a gun.  Although the victim tried to flee, there was no confrontation between
him and the appellant as to put the victim on guard for the attack.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the trial court correctly considered the killing as murder
qualified by treachery under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code.  In the absence of any aggravating or
mitigating circumstance, the proper penalty is the medium period of <i style=""><span style="">reclusion</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">temporal</span></i><span style=""> maximum </span><span style="">to </span>death which is <i style=""><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">At around 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon of August 8, 1985, Mrs. Evelvie
Gavina was at the Producers' Market in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila waiting for
her change after buying something when she heard a gunshot.  Turning her head to the right, she saw a man
who was having a manicure slump on his seat.  At the same time, she saw from a distance of two meters, a person with a
gun standing one foot away from the victim.  The person who shot the man then passed in front of her and boarded a
tricycle which already had a passenger.  It was the first time that Evelvie saw the gun wielder but later, she
learned that he was the appellant and that his victim was Alfredo Raranga.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Evelvie singled out appellant in a police line-up on June 6, 1989 at the office

<p class="BODY">In his defense, appellant testified that at about 10:30 in the
morning of August 8, 1985, he left his house in Mandaluyong with Ronnie, Jayson
and Caloy to attend a fiesta in Camp Crame, particularly at the house of a
certain Bobby Langkawon.  They had a
drinking session which lasted until about midnight.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented another witness, Luisa Caraquel, who
testified that at the time of the incident, she was selling "balut"
in front of the Antoinette Carinderia and the Sheryl Beauty Parlor at the
Producers' Market in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.  She was certain that appellant was not the killer as she was able
to take a good look at the assailant who had inquired from her the price of the
"balut" she was selling.  She
noticed that the assailant kept on turning his head.  Without buying any "balut", he walked away while taking
out something from his jacket.  She
later heard a gunshot and saw the victim slumped on his chair.  She saw the man run away and, in her panic,
she ran inside the Antoinette Carinderia.  Afraid that the assailant might go after her, she left Mandaluyong the
following day and settled in Caloocan City.</p>

<p class="BODY">About the time appellant was arrested and detained at the
Mandaluyong Police Station, Luisa met an acquaintance in Balintawak who
informed her that the assailant in the August 8, 1985 incident had been
arrested.  Out of curiosity, she went to
the Mandaluyong jail to see if it was the same man she saw at the Producers'
Market on August 8, 1985.  As she was
sure that it was a different man, she told the <span style="">relatives of the appellant about it and they persuaded her to testify
in court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant contends that his witness, Luisa
Caraquel, was in a "better position" to identify the assailant than
prosecution witness Evelvie Gavina; that the trial court erred in
"creating an evidence" inexistent at the time of the incident; that
the testimony of the doctor who autopsied the victim was not a proper basis for
pinpointing responsibility on him; that there was no aggravating circumstance
to qualify the killing as murder, and that his criminal liability had not been
proven beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As we have said, the issue of credibility of a witness is
addressed to the trial court which has the opportunity to observe him or her at
the witness stand.  In the case at bar,
the trial court cannot be faulted for rejecting the testimony of defense
witness Luisa Caraquel.  In the first
place, if Luisa were indeed as civic-minded as she pictured herself to be, she
should not have waited for around four (4) years to volunteer as a
witness.  Secondly, if she was really
afraid of the assailant she would have distanced herself from the case.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense failed to dent Evelvie's
credibility as a witness.  No evil
motive was attributed to her for implicating appellant in the crime.  It is settled that where there is no
evidence to indicate that the witness <span style="">was </span>actuated by any improper motive, the
presumption is that he or she was not so actuated and that his or her testimony
is entitled to full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span>Appellant's testimony that Evelvie was not the same
woman who pinpointed him at the police line-up as the culprit does not hold any
evidentiary value.  Uncorroborated, it
is no more than a self-serving statement designed to extricate himself from
liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the testimonies of Dr. Lucero and Marieta
Raranga, the victim's wife, the same are at most corroborative and not the
principal bases for appellant's conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention that no qualifying circumstance was proven
is misleading.  The trial court clearly
ruled out the existence of evident premeditation which, although alleged in the
informations in both this case and in Criminal Case No. 64831, had not been
proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.  However, the trial court did prove that treachery attended the
killing.  In this case, the victim was
having himself manicured when out of nowhere, appellant shot him in the
head.  Appellant gave the victim
practically no chance to defend himself or to repel the assault against him in
view of the sudden and unexpected attack on his person which ensured its accomplishment.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the appellant should be held liable for murder and there
being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, he should be meted the
penalty of <i style=""><span style="">reclusion perpetua.</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In both cases, appellant has been proven beyond reasonable doubt to
have cold-bloodedly committed the murders of Edgardo Bondoc Tagubanza and
Alfredo Raranga.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
He should therefore be dealt with with the full force of the law.  However, the trial court committed a mistake
in imposing the penalty of "life imprisonment" apparently on the
belief that it is the English version of <i style=""><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="">.  </span>At this point, therefore we wish to
reiterate our ruling in <i style=""><span style="">People v. Ruelan</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">where we enumerated the distinctions between
the two penalties, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>As noted from the dispositive portion of the assailed decision, the
trial court imposed the penalty of ‘life imprisonment’ for the crime of
murder.  Evidently, the said court
failed to appreciate the substantial difference between <i style="">Reclusion</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">Perpetua</i><span style=""> </span>under the Revised Penal Code and Life Imprisonment when imposed
as a penalty by special law.  These two
penalties are different and distinct from each other.  Hence, we would like to reiterate our admonition in the case of
People vs. Penillos (205 SCRA 546, 565­-566), likewise quoted under Administrative
Circular No. 6-92 dated October 12, 1992 re:  the correct application of the penalties of <i style="">reclusion</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">perpetua</i><span style=""> </span>and life imprisonment, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">As noted from the dispositive portion of the challenged decision,
the trial court imposed the penalty <span style="">of <i>‘</i></span><i style="">reclusion</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">perpetua or life
imprisonment’</i><span style="">.  </span><span style="">Evidently,
it considered the latter as the English translation of the former, which is not
the case.  Both are different and
distinct penalties.  In the recent case
of </span><i style="">People</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">vs</i><span style="">. </span><i style="">Baguio</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">(196 SCRA 459, 469), this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">The Code does not prescribe the penalty of ‘life imprisonment’ for
any of the felonies therein defined, that penalty being invariably imposed for
serious offenses penalized not by the Revised Penal Code but by special <span style="">laws.  </span><i style="">Reclusion</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">perpetua</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">entails imprisonment for at least thirty (30) years after which the
convict becomes eligible for pardon, it also carries with it accessory
penalties, namely:  perpetual special
disqualification, etc.  It is not the
same as ‘life imprisonment’ which, for one thing, does not carry with it any
accessory penalty, and for another, does not appear to have any definite extent
or duration.’</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
