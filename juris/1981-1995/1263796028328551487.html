<p>In the early morning of 15 November 1975 — at about 1:30 a.m. — private 
respondent Leonardo Dionisio was on his way home — he lived in 1214-B Zamora 
Street, Bangkal, Makati - from a cocktails-and-dinner meeting with his boss, the 
general manager of a marketing corporation.&nbsp; During the cocktails phase of the 
evening, Dionisio had taken "a shot or two" of liquor.&nbsp; Dionisio was driving his 
Volkswagen car and had just crossed the intersection of General Lacuna and 
General Santos Streets at Bangkal, Makati, not far from his home, and was 
proceeding down General Lacuna Street, when his car headlights (in his 
allegation) suddenly failed.&nbsp; He switched his headlights on "bright" and 
thereupon he saw a Ford dump truck looming some 2-1/2 meters away from his car.&nbsp; 
The dump truck, owned by and registered in the name of petitioner Phoenix 
Construction Inc.&nbsp; ("Phoenix"), was parked on the right hand side of General 
Lacuna Street (<em>i.e.</em>, on the right hand side of a person facing in the 
same direction toward which Dionisio's car was proceeding), facing the oncoming 
traffic.&nbsp; The dump truck was parked askew (not parallel to the street curb) in 
such a manner as to stick out onto the street, partly blocking the way of 
oncoming traffic.&nbsp; There were no lights nor any so-called "early warning" 
reflector devices set anywhere near the dump truck, front or rear.&nbsp; The dump 
truck had earlier that evening been driven home by petitioner Armando U. 
Carbonel, its regular driver, with the permission of his employer Phoenix, in 
view of work scheduled to be carried out early the following morning.&nbsp; Dionisio 
claimed that he tried to avoid a collision by swerving his car to the left but 
it was too late and his car smashed into the dump truck.&nbsp; As a result of the 
collision, Dionisio suffered some physical injuries including some permanent 
facial scars, a "nervous breakdown" and loss of two gold bridge 
dentures.<br><br>Dionisio commenced an action for damages in the Court of First 
Instance of Pampanga basically claiming that the legal and proximate cause of 
his injuries was the negligent manner in which Carbonel had parked the dump 
truck entrusted to him by his employer Phoenix.&nbsp; Phoenix and Carbonel, on the 
other hand, countered that the proximate cause of Dionisio's injuries was his 
own recklessness in driving fast at the time of the accident, while under the 
influence of liquor, without his headlights on and without a curfew pass.&nbsp; 
Phoenix also sought to establish that it had exercised due care in the selection 
and supervision of the dump truck driver.<br><br>The trial court rendered 
judgment in favor of Dionisio and against Phoenix and Carbonel and ordered the 
latter:</p>
<blockquote>"(1) To pay plaintiff jointly and severally the sum of 
<em>P15,000.00 for hospital bills and the&nbsp; replacement of the lost dentures of 
plaintiff</em>;<br><br>(2) To pay plaintiff jointly and severally the sum of 
<em>P150,000.00 as loss of expected income </em>for plaintiff brought about the 
accident in controversy and which is the result of the negligence of the 
defendants;<br><br>(3) To pay the plaintiff jointly and severally the sum of 
<em>P100,000.00 as moral damages</em> for the unexpected and sudden withdrawal 
of plaintiff from his lifetime career as a marketing man; mental anguish, 
wounded feeling, serious anxiety, social humiliation, besmirched reputation, 
feeling of economic insecurity, and the untold sorrows and frustration in life 
experienced by plaintiff and his family since the accident in controversy up to 
the present time;<br><br>(4) To pay plaintiff jointly and severally the sum of 
<em>P10,000.00 as exemplary damages</em> for the wanton disregard of defendants 
to settle amicably this case with the plaintiff before the filing of this case 
in court for a smaller amount.<br><br>(5) To pay the plaintiff jointly and 
severally the sum of <em>P4,500.00 due as and&nbsp; for attorney's fees</em>; 
and<br><br>(6) The cost of suit." (Underscoring supplied)
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Phoenix and Carbonel appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court.&nbsp; That 
court in CA-G.R. No. 65476 affirmed the decision of the trial court but modified 
the award of damages to the following extent:</p>
<ol><li>The award of P15,000.00 as compensatory damages was reduced to 
<em>P6,460.71</em>, the latter being the only amount that the appellate court 
found the plaintiff to have proved as actually sustained by him;<br><br></li><li>The award of P150,000.00 as loss of expected income was reduced to 
<em>P100,000.00</em>, basically because Dionisio had voluntarily resigned his 
job such that, in the opinion of the appellate court, his loss of income "was 
not solely attributable to the accident in question"; and<br><br></li><li>The award of P100,000.00 as moral damages was held by the appellate court as 
excessive and unconscionable and hence reduced to 
<em>P50,000.00</em>.<br></li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The award of <em>P10,000.00</em> as exemplary damages and <em>P4,500.00</em> 
as attorney's fees and costs remained untouched.</p></blockquote>
<p>This decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court is now before us on a 
petition for review.<br><br>Both the trial court and the appellate court had 
made fairly explicit findings of fact relating to the manner in which the dump 
truck was parked along General Lacuna Street on the basis of which both courts 
drew the inference that there was negligence on the part of Carbonel, the dump 
truck driver, and that this negligence was the proximate cause of the accident 
and Dionisio's injuries.&nbsp; We note, however, that both courts failed to pass upon 
the defense raised by Carbonel and Phoenix that the true legal and proximate 
cause of the accident was not the way in which the dump truck had been parked 
but rather the reckless way in which Dionisio had driven his car that night when 
he smashed into the dump truck.&nbsp; The Intermediate Appellate Court in its 
questioned decision casually conceded that Dionisio was "in some way, negligent" 
but apparently failed to see the relevance of Dionisio's negligence and made no 
further mention of it.&nbsp; We have examined the record both before the trial court 
and the Intermediate Appellate Court and we find that both parties had placed 
into the record sufficient evidence on the basis of which the trial court and 
the appellate court could have and should have made findings of fact relating to 
the alleged reckless manner in which Dionisio drove his car that night.&nbsp; The 
petitioners Phoenix and Carbonel contend that if there was negligence in the 
manner in which the dump truck was parked, that negligence was merely a "passive 
and static condition" and that private respondent Dionisio's recklessness 
constituted an intervening, efficient cause determinative of the accident and 
the injuries he sustained.&nbsp; The need to administer substantial justice as 
between the parties in this case, without having to remand it back to the trial 
court after eleven years, compels us to address directly the contention put 
forward by the petitioners and to examine for ourselves the record pertaining to 
Dionisio's alleged negligence which must bear upon the liability, or extent of 
liability, of Phoenix and Carbonel.<br><br>There are four factual issues that 
need to be looked into:&nbsp; (a) whether or not private respondent Dionisio had a 
curfew pass valid and effective for that eventful night; (b) whether Dionisio 
was driving fast or speeding just before the collision with the dump truck; (c) 
whether Dionisio had purposely turned off his car's headlights before contact 
with the dump truck or whether those headlights accidentally malfunctioned 
moments before the collision; and (d) whether Dionisio was intoxicated at the 
time of the accident.<br><br>As to the first issue relating to the curfew pass, 
it is clear that no curfew pass was found on the person of Dionisio immediately 
after the accident nor was any found in his car.&nbsp; Phoenix's evidence here 
consisted of the testimony of Patrolman Cuyno who had taken Dionisio, 
unconscious, to the Makati Medical Center for emergency treatment immediately 
after the accident.&nbsp; At the Makati Medical Center, a nurse took off Dionisio's 
clothes and examined them along with the contents of pockets together with 
Patrolman Cuyno.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Private respondent 
Dionisio was not able to produce any curfew pass during the trial.&nbsp; Instead, he 
offered the explanation that his family may have misplaced his curfew pass.&nbsp; He 
also offered a certification (dated two years after the accident) issued by one 
Major Benjamin N. Libarnes of the Zone Integrated Police Intelligence Unit of 
Camp Olivas, San Fernando, Pampanga, which was said to have authority to issue 
curfew passes for Pampanga and Metro Manila.&nbsp; This certification was to the 
effect that private respondent Dionisio had a valid curfew pass.&nbsp; This 
certification did not, however, specify any pass serial number or date or period 
of effectivity of the supposed curfew pass.&nbsp; We find that private respondent 
Dionisio was unable to prove possession of a valid curfew pass during the night 
of the accident and that the preponderance of evidence shows that he did not 
have such a pass during that night.&nbsp; The relevance of possession or 
non-possession of a curfew pass that night lies in the light it tends to shed on 
the other related issues:&nbsp; whether Dionisio was speeding home and whether he had 
indeed purposely put out his headlights before the accident, in order to avoid 
detection and possibly arrest by the police in the nearby police station for 
travelling after the onset of curfew without a valid curfew pass.<br><br>On the 
second issue — whether or not Dionisio was speeding home that night — both the 
trial court and the appellate court were completely silent.<br><br>The 
defendants in the trial court introduced the testimony of Patrolman Cuyno who 
was at the scene of the accident almost immediately after it occurred, the 
police station where he was based being barely 200 meters away.&nbsp; Patrolman Cuyno 
testified that people who had gathered at the scene of the accident told him 
that Dionisio's car was "moving fast” and did not have its headlights on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Dionisio, on the other hand, claimed that 
he was travelling at a moderate speed at 30 kilometers per hour and had just 
crossed the intersection of General Santos and General Lacuna Streets and had 
started to accelerate when his headlights failed just before the collision took 
place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Private respondent 
Dionisio asserts that Patrolman Cuyno's testimony was hearsay and did not fall 
within any of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule since the facts he 
testified to were not acquired by him through official information and had not 
been given by the informants pursuant to any duty to do so.&nbsp; Private 
respondent's objection fails to take account of the fact that the testimony of 
Patrolman Cuyno is admissible not under the official records exception to the 
hearsay rule<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> but rather as part of the 
res gestae.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Testimonial evidence under 
this exception to the hearsay rule consists of excited utterances made on the 
occasion of an occurrence or event sufficiently startling in nature so as to 
render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer and 
hence made as a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event, and not the 
result of reflective thought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>We think that an automobile 
speeding down a street and suddenly smashing into a stationary object in the 
dead of night is a sufficiently startling event as to evoke spontaneous, rather 
than reflective, reactions from observers who happened to be around at that 
time.&nbsp; The testimony of Patrolman Cuyno was therefore admissible as part of the 
res gestae and should have been considered by the trial court.&nbsp; Clearly, 
substantial weight should have been ascribed to such testimony, even though it 
did not, as it could not, have purported to describe quantitatively the precise 
velocity at which Dionisio was travelling just before impact with the Phoenix 
dump truck.<br><br>A third related issue is whether Dionisio purposely turned 
off his headlights, or whether his headlights accidentally malfunctioned, just 
moments before the accident.&nbsp; The Intermediate Appellate Court expressly found 
that the headlights of Dionisio's car went off as he crossed the intersection 
but was non-committal as to why they did so.&nbsp; It is the petitioners' contention 
that Dionisio purposely shut off his headlights even before he reached the 
intersection so as not to be detected by the police in the police precinct which 
he (being a resident in the area) knew was not far away from the intersection.&nbsp; 
We believe that the petitioners' theory is a more credible explanation than that 
offered by private respondent Dionisio — <em>i.e.</em>, that he had his 
headlights on but that, at the crucial moment, these had in some mysterious if 
convenient way malfunctioned and gone off, although he succeeded in switching 
his lights on again at "bright" split seconds before contact with the dump 
truck.<br><br>A fourth and final issue relates to whether Dionisio was 
intoxicated at the time of the accident.&nbsp; The evidence here consisted of the 
testimony of Patrolman Cuyno to the effect that private respondent Dionisio 
smelled of liquor at the time he was taken from his smashed car and brought to 
the Makati Medical Center in an unconscious condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This testimony has to be taken in 
conjunction with the admission of Dionisio that he had taken "a shot or two" of 
liquor before dinner with his boss that night.&nbsp; We do not believe that this 
evidence is sufficient to show that Dionisio was so heavily under the influence 
of liquor as to constitute his driving a motor vehicle <em>per se</em> an act of 
reckless imprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> There simply is 
not enough evidence to show how much liquor he had in fact taken and the effects 
of that upon his physical faculties or upon his judgment or mental alertness.&nbsp; 
We are also aware that "one shot or two" of hard liquor may affect different 
people differently.<br><br>The conclusion we draw from the factual circumstances 
outlined above is that private respondent Dionisio was negligent the night of 
the accident.&nbsp; He was hurrying home that night and driving faster than he should 
have been.&nbsp; Worse, he extinguished his headlights at or near the intersection of 
General Lacuna and General Santos Streets and thus did not see the dump truck 
that was parked askew and sticking out onto the road lane.<br><br>Nonetheless, 
we agree with the Court of First Instance and the Intermediate Appellate Court 
that the legal and proximate cause of the accident and of Dionisio's injuries 
was the wrongful or negligent manner in which the dump truck was parked — in 
other words, the negligence of petitioner Carbonel.&nbsp; That there was a reasonable 
relationship between petitioner Carbonel's negligence on the one hand and the 
accident and respondent's injuries on the other hand, is quite clear.&nbsp; Put in a 
slightly different manner, the collision of Dionisio's car with the dump truck 
was a natural and foreseeable consequence of the truck driver's 
negligence.<br><br>The petitioners, however, urge that the truck driver's 
negligence was merely a "passive and static condition" and that private 
respondent Dionisio's negligence was an "efficient intervening cause", and that 
consequently Dionisio's negligence must be regarded as the legal and proximate 
cause of the accident rather than the earlier negligence of Carbonel.&nbsp; We note 
that the petitioners' arguments are drawn from a reading of some of the older 
cases in various jurisdictions in the United States but we are unable to 
persuade ourselves that these arguments have any validity for our jurisdiction.&nbsp; 
We note, firstly, that even in the United States, the distinctions between 
"cause" and "condition" which the petitioners would have us adopt have already 
been "almost entirely discredited".&nbsp; Professors Prosser and Keeton make this 
quite clear:<br><br>"<em>Cause and Condition</em>.&nbsp; Many courts have sought to 
distinguish between the active "cause" of the harm and the existing "conditions" 
upon which that cause operated.&nbsp; If the defendant has created only a passive 
static condition which made the damage possible, the defendant is said not to be 
liable.&nbsp; <em>But so far as the fact of causation is concerned, in the sense of 
necessary antecedents which have played an important part in producing the 
result, it is quite impossible to distinguish between active forces and passive 
situations, particularly since, as is invariably the case, the latter are the 
result of other active forces which have gone before</em>.&nbsp; The defendant who 
spills gasoline about the premises creates a "condition;" but the act may be 
culpable because of the danger of fire.&nbsp; When a spark ignites the gasoline, the 
condition has done quite as much to bring about the fire as the spark; and since 
that is the very risk which the defendant has created, the defendant will not 
escape responsibility.&nbsp; <em>Even the lapse of a considerable time during which 
the "condition" remains static will not necessarily affect liability; one who 
digs a trench in the highway may still be liable to another who falls into it a 
month afterward.&nbsp; "Cause" and "condition" still find occasional mention in the 
decisions; but the distinction is now almost entirely discredited</em>.&nbsp; So far 
as it has any validity at all, it must refer to the type of case where the 
forces set in operation by the defendant have come to rest in a position of 
apparent safety, and some new force intervenes.&nbsp; <em>But even in such cases, it 
is not the distinction between "cause" and "condition" which is important, but 
the nature of the risk and the character of the intervening cause</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>We believe, secondly, that the 
truck driver's negligence far from being a “passive and static condition" was 
rather an indispensable and efficient cause.&nbsp; The collision between the dump 
truck and the private respondent's car would in all probability not have 
occurred had the dump truck not been parked askew without any warning lights or 
reflector devices.&nbsp; The improper parking of the dump truck created an 
unreasonable risk of injury for anyone driving down General Lacuna Street and 
for having so created this risk, the truck driver must be held responsible.&nbsp; In 
our view, Dionisio's negligence, although later in point of time than the truck 
driver's negligence and therefore closer to the accident, was not an efficient 
intervening or independent cause.&nbsp; What the petitioners describe as an 
"intervening cause" was no more than a foreseeable consequence of the risk 
created by the negligent manner in which the truck driver had parked the dump 
truck.&nbsp; In other words, the petitioner truck driver owed a duty to private 
respondent Dionisio and others similarly situated not to impose upon them the 
very risk the truck driver had created.&nbsp; Dionisio's negligence was not of an 
independent and overpowering nature as to cut, as it were, the chain of 
causation in fact between the improper parking of the dump truck and the 
accident, nor to sever the <em>juris vinculum</em> of liability.&nbsp; It is helpful 
to quote once more from Prosser and Keeton:<br><br>"<em>Foreseeable Intervening 
Causes.&nbsp; If the intervening cause is one which in ordinary human experience is 
reasonably to be anticipated, or one which the defendant has reason to 
anticipate under the particular circumstances, the defendant may be negligent, 
among other reasons, because of failure to guard against it; or the defendant 
may be negligent only for that reason</em>.&nbsp; Thus one who sets a fire may be 
required to foresee that an ordinary, usual and customary wind arising later 
will spread it beyond the defendant's own property, and therefore to take 
precautions to prevent that event.&nbsp; The person who leaves combustible or 
explosive material exposed in a public place may foresee the risk of fire from 
some independent source.&nbsp; x x x <em>In all of these cases there is an 
intervening cause combining with the defendant's conduct to produce the result, 
and in each case the defendant's&nbsp; negligence consists in failure to protect the 
plaintiff against that very risk</em>.<br><br><em>Obviously the defendant cannot 
be relieved from liability by the fact that the risk or a substantial and 
important part of the risk, to which the defendant has subjected the plaintiff 
has indeed come to pass.&nbsp; Foreseeable intervening forces are within the scope of 
the original risk, and hence of the defendant's negligence</em>.&nbsp; The courts are 
quite generally agreed that intervening causes which fall fairly in this 
category will not supersede the defendant's responsibility.<br><br><em>Thus it 
has been held that a defendant will be required to anticipate the usual weather 
of the vicinity, including all ordinary forces of nature such as usual wind or 
rain, or snow or frost or fog or even lightning; that one who leaves an 
obstruction on the road or a railroad track should foresee that a vehicle or a 
train will run into it</em>; x x x.<br><br><em>The risk created by the defendant 
may include the intervention of the foreseeable negligence of others.&nbsp; x x x 
[T]he standard of reasonable conduct may require the defendant to&nbsp; protect the 
plaintiff against 'that occasional&nbsp; negligence&nbsp; which is one of the ordinary&nbsp; 
incidents of human life, and therefore to be anticipated</em>’.&nbsp; Thus, a 
defendant who blocks the sidewalk and forces the plaintiff to walk in a street 
where the plaintiff will be exposed to the risks of heavy traffic becomes liable 
when the plaintiff is run down by a car, even though the car is negligently 
driven; <em>and one who parks an automobile on the highway without lights at 
night is not relieved of responsibility when another negligently drives into 
it</em>. —"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>We hold that 
private respondent Dionisio's negligence was "only contributory", that the 
"immediate and proximate cause" of the injury remained the truck driver's "lack 
of due care" and that consequently respondent Dionisio may recover damages 
though such damages are subject to mitigation by the courts (Article 2179, Civil 
Code of the Philippines).<br><br>Petitioners also ask us to apply what they 
refer to as the "last clear chance" doctrine.&nbsp; The theory here of petitioners is 
that while the petitioner truck driver was negligent, private respondent 
Dionisio had the "last clear chance" of avoiding the accident and hence his 
injuries, and that Dionisio having failed to take that "last clear chance" must 
bear his own injuries alone.&nbsp; The last clear chance doctrine of the common law 
was imported into our jurisdiction by <em>Picart vs. Smith</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> but it is a matter for debate whether, or 
to what extent, it has found its way into the Civil Code of the Philippines.&nbsp; 
The historical function of that doctrine in the common law was to mitigate the 
harshness of another common law doctrine or rule — that of contributory 
negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The common law rule of 
contributory negligence prevented any recovery at all by a plaintiff who was 
also negligent, even if the plaintiff's negligence was relatively minor as 
compared with the wrongful act or omission of the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The common law notion of last clear 
chance permitted courts to grant recovery to a plaintiff who had also been 
negligent provided that the defendant had the last clear chance to avoid the 
casualty and failed to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
Accordingly, it is difficult to see what role, if any, the common law last clear 
chance doctrine has to play in a jurisdiction where the common law concept of 
contributory negligence as an absolute bar to recovery by the plaintiff, has 
itself been rejected, as it has been in Article 2179 of the Civil Code of the 
Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Is there perhaps 
a general concept of "last clear chance" that may be extracted from its common 
law matrix and utilized as a general rule in negligence cases in a civil law 
jurisdiction like ours?&nbsp; We do not believe so.&nbsp; Under Article 2179, the task of 
a court, in technical terms, is to determine whose negligence — the plaintiff's 
or the defendant's — was the legal or proximate cause of the injury.&nbsp; That task 
is not simply or even primarily an exercise in chronology or physics, as the 
petitioners seem to imply by the use of terms like "last" or "intervening" or 
"immediate".&nbsp; The relative location in the continuum of time of the plaintiff's 
and the defendant's negligent acts or omissions, is only one of the relevant 
factors that may be taken into account.&nbsp; Of more fundamental importance are the 
nature of the negligent act or omission of each party and the character and 
gravity of the risks created by such act or omission for the rest of the 
community.&nbsp; The petitioners urge that the truck driver (and therefore his 
employer) should be absolved from responsibility for his own prior negligence 
because the unfortunate plaintiff failed to act with that increased diligence 
which had become necessary to avoid the peril precisely created by the truck 
driver's own wrongful act or omission.&nbsp; To accept this proposition is to come 
too close to wiping out the fundamental principle of law that a man must respond 
for the forseeable consequences of his own negligent act or omission.&nbsp; Our law 
on quasi-delicts seeks to reduce the risks and burdens of living in society and 
to allocate them among the members of society.&nbsp; To accept the petitioners' 
proposition must tend to weaken the very bonds of society.<br><br>Petitioner 
Carbonel's proven negligence creates a presumption of negligence on the part of 
his employer Phoenix<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> in supervising 
its employees properly and adequately.&nbsp; The respondent appellate court in effect 
found, correctly in our opinion, that Phoenix was not able to overcome this 
presumption of negligence.&nbsp; The circumstance that Phoenix had allowed its truck 
driver to bring the dump truck to his home whenever there was work to be done 
early the following morning, when coupled with the failure to show any effort on 
the part of Phoenix to supervise the manner in which the dump truck is parked 
when away from company premises, is an affirmative showing of <em>culpa in 
vigilando </em>on the part of Phoenix.<br><br>Turning to the award of damages 
and taking into account the comparative negligence of private respondent 
Dionisio on one hand and petitioners Carbonel and Phoenix upon the other 
hand,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> we believe that the demands of 
substantial justice are satisfied by allocating most of the damages on a 20-80 
ratio.&nbsp; Thus, 20% of the damages awarded by the respondent appellate court, 
except the award of P10,000.00 as exemplary damages and P4,500.00 as attorney's 
fees and costs, shall be borne by private respondent Dionisio; only the balance 
of 80% needs to be paid by petitioners Carbonel and Phoenix who shall be 
solidarily liable therefor to the former.&nbsp; The award of exemplary damages and 
attorney's fees and costs shall be borne exclusively by the petitioners.&nbsp; 
Phoenix is of course entitled to reimbursement from Carbonel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> We see no sufficient reason for 
disturbing the reduce award of damages made by the respondent appellate 
court.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the respondent 
appellate court is modified by reducing the aggregate amount of compensatory 
damages, loss of expected income and moral damages private respondent Dionisio 
is entitled to by 20% of such amount.&nbsp; Costs against the 
petitioners.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>. </p>
