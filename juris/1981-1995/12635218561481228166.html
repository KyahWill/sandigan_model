This case is similar to the Lindberg case where the incident took place 
in Hopewell, New Jersey, the Garden State, many, many years ago.  It is 
about a boy of tender years who was kidnapped for ransom and then 
killed.  In the cold and legalese words of the information which was 
filed in Criminal Case No. 198 of the defunct Court of First Instance of
 Camarines Sur, the crime was said to have been committed as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "That on or about and within the period embraced from September 
2, 1970 up to and in­cluding September 10, 1970, in the City of Naga, 
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused, with intent and/or for the purpose of extorting 
ran­som, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one 
another, being all private individuals, did, then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and illegally take and kidnap one RAUL ODIAMAR Y VENERACION, a
 7-year old son of the herein complaining witness, SAMUEL ODIAMAR Y 
FLORECE, and the above accused, once in custody of said minor child, 
did, then and there ask and demand from the father ransom in the amount 
of P20,000.00, Philippine Currency, and for which only the sum of 
P1,000.00 was given by the complainant to the herein accused and then 
the latter, accused, with intent to kill, by means of treachery, taking 
advantage of superior strength and by employing means to insure or 
afford impunity, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously 
and unmercifully hack the right knee and bash the head of the child RAUL
 ODIAMAR Y VENERACION, thereby said accused causing the inflicting fatal
 and mortal wounds on the vital parts of the body of the said victim 
causing the instantaneous death of the latter. " (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 132.) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The "above-named accused" were:  CERILO DE LEON, ARMANDO REMO, ANGEL 
VALENCIA, DOMINGO VALENCIA, FRANCISCO JESALVA, JOSE ARANDIA and BERNARDO
 FIEJOO who all pleaded not guilty.
</p><p>
In the course of the trial, the prosecution moved for the discharge of 
JOSE ARANDIA so that he could be utilized as a state witness.  The 
motion was granted.
</p><p>
The prosecution presented twenty-one (21) witnesses; the defense had a 
total of twenty-five (25) witnesses.  The transcript is so bulky that it
 is more convenient to reckon it by weight rather than by the number of 
pages.
</p><p>
The decision of the trial court is equally weighty for it consists of 
222 pages and the reason is not difficult to perceive - it contains 
unnecessary details which did not improve its quality, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "At about 4:00 o'clock of the same day, September 2, 1970, Cerilo 
de Leon borrowed from Graciano Badilla the Cony (Exhibit H-2) telling 
the latter that he had a date.  Graciano Badilla gave him the Cony and 
the accused Cerilo de Leon drove the Cony himself and proceeded along 
Peñafrancia Avenue and on passing in front of the Alatco station Cerilo 
de Leon saw Jose Arandia.  The former called the latter and asked him to
 accompany him, Cerilo de Leon, being the "bilas" of Graciano Badilla, 
owner of the Cony he permanently drives everyday, and having been once 
his chief in the Saldaña Lines when Cerilo de Leon acted as its Manager 
while its owner, Mr. Saldaña was on a honeymoon, readily acceded and 
went, sitting himself beside De Leon in the front seat of the Cony.  De 
Leon continued driving the Cony himself and they proceeded along 
Peñafrancia Avenue towards the North.  On reaching Santonja Street they 
turned left and upon reaching Elias Angeles Street they turned right 
towards the junction of Bagumbayan and Elias Angeles Streets and turned 
left again to Ateneo Avenue.  On reaching the gate of the Naga Parochial
 School along Ateneo Avenue, Cerilo stopped and parked the Cony in front
 of the gate, and alighted therefrom, telling Arandia to wait for him as
 he will just fetch somebody. " (<em>Idem</em>, pp. 1037-1038.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The decision could have simply stated that Cerilo borrowed a Cony 
automobile from Graciano and while driving it he met Jose, a former 
driver of Saldaña Lines which he managed for a short time and together 
they went to the Naga Parochial School.  The excruciating details 
especially the left and right turns clutter the decision and distract 
one's attention.  At any rate, REMO, the VALENCIA'S, JESALVA and FIEJOO 
were acquitted "for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt." 
CERILO DE LEON was found guilty and sentenced to death and ordered "to 
indemnify the heirs of Raul Veneracion Odiamar the sum of Twelve 
Thousand (P12,000.00) Pesos; to pay Samuel Odiamar the sum of P920.00 
part of the ransom money received by the accused, Cerilo de Leon; and to
 pay the proportionate part of the costs in this case." (<em>Idem</em>, pp. 1250-1251.)
</p><p>
The People's counterstatement of facts is an edited version of the lengthy statement of the trial court as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Samuel Odiamar and Luz Veneracion are husband and wife with 
several children, the eldest among them being Raul who at the time of 
the in­cident on September 2, 1970 was almost eight years old (Exh. A). 
 Samuel Odiamar, the father of Raul was formerly employed as Cashier at 
the Bicol Savings and Loan Association, BISALA for short, in Naga City. 
 Among his friends and co-emplo­yees were the accused Cerilo de Leon, 
Armando Remo, Loan Officer of BISALA, Angel Valencia and Bernardo Fiejoo
 who were all holding respon­sible positions in said banking 
institution, except Bernardo Fiejoo who was a security guard.  The 
accused, together with Samuel Odiamar, as a form of relaxation, used to 
indulge in gambling among themselves.  The accused Francisco Jesalva is 
an employee of the Provincial Treasurer's Office of the province of 
Camarines Sur.  Domingo Valencia is a younger brother of Angel Valencia.
 </p>
  <p> "On January 5, 1970, Samuel Odiamar resigned as cashier.  He 
intended to transfer to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.  While thus 
employed, he continued to join the gambling sessions.  As luck had it, 
Samuel Odiamar seemed to have always won in these gambling sessions and 
the accused Cerilo de Leon and Francisco Jesalva were often the heavy 
losers.  Consequently, Cerilo de Leon in­curred indebtedness to Samuel 
Odiamar.  Checks issued in payment of his gambling losses to Samuel 
Odiamar bounced or were dishonored by the bank upon which they were 
drawn.  (Vol. I, pp. 119-121, t.s.n.) </p>
  <p> "With this factual setting, Samuel Odiamar's eldest son, Raul, who
 was then studying at the Naga Parochial School in Naga City did not 
return from school in the afternoon of September 2, 1970.  Why Raul did 
not return from school is supplied by the testimony of former accused 
Jose Arandia, now state witness. </p>
  <p> "Jose Arandia was a driver of a vehicle, com­monly called "Cony" 
(Exh. H-2), owned and ope­rated by Graciano Badilla, the brother-in-law 
(bilas) of appellant Cerilo de Leon.  On September 2, 1970 Jose Arandia,
 after driving the Cony since early in the evening of the preceding 
night, returned the Cony to its garage at noon of September 2, 1970 
(Vol. III, p. 5, t.s.n.).  At about 4:00 o'clock of the same day, 
September 2, 1970, appellant Cerilo de Leon borrowed the Cony from 
Graciano Badilla as he had a date.  Graciano Badilla lent him the Cony 
and the appellant drove it away.  While passing in front of the Alatco 
Station, the ap­pellant saw Jose Arandia.  Appellant Cerilo de Leon 
called Arandia and asked the latter to accompany him.  Jose Arandia 
readily acceded as appellant Cerilo de Leon was the brother-in-law 
(bilas) of Badilla, owner and operator of the Cony. </p>
  <p> "The two proceeded to Ateneo Avenue.  On reaching the gate of the 
Naga Parochial School appellant Cerilo de Leon stopped and parked the 
Cony in front of the gate.  He alighted telling Arandia to wait for him 
as he will just fetch somebody.  Five minutes later, the appellant 
returned, this time with a child about four (4) feet tall, wearing white
 T-shirt, with letters NPS on the breast of the T-shirt which stand for 
Naga Parochial School, Khaki short pants, white socks and black shoes 
with a school bag slung on his shoulders.  Arandia was instructed to 
drive the Cony and told that they will conduct the boy to his house at 
San Agustin, Canaman, Camarines Sur, as it was then raining at the time.
  On passing the Philippine Constabulary check-point along the road in 
Paras, Canaman, the boy remarked that they had already passed their 
house in San Agustin, but appellant Cerilo de Leon told the boy not to 
mind it because they will just go to Calabanga to get something and he 
would be taken home on their return.  Upon reaching Calabanga, they 
turned right to the road going to Tinambac.  On reaching Ratay Bridge, 
the appellant alighted and went to the back of the Cony.  He covered the
 vehicle's plate number with a cardboard similar in size to the plate of
 the Cony, but bearing a different number.  He then went to the front 
and did the same, after which, Jose Arandia was told to proceed, which 
the latter did.  Fifty meters away from the National Road on the road to
 Camuning, Jose Arandia was told to stop and to alight from the Cony.  
He was instructed to wait until the appellant and the child returned, 
because they would get something from Camuning.  Arandia did as he was 
told.  He alighted from the Cony and appellant drove it himself. (Vol. 
II, pp. 23-24, t.s.n.) </p>
  <p> "What transpired in Camuning after Arandia was left behind is 
supplied by the testimony of pro­secution witness Edmundo Dualan, a 
worker in the coconut plantation of Felix Gutierrez, uncle of the 
appellant. </p>
  <p> "When the appellant arrived at Camuning in the coconut plantation 
of his uncle, Felix Gutier­rez, he parked the Cony near the latter's 
house and approached Edmundo Dualan and Luisa Sami­niano who were in the
 copra shed.  Cerilo told them that he wanted to have some young 
coconuts.  The house of Felix Gutierrez where the Cony was parked is 
about 100 meters from the copra shed.  The child seated himself on a 
piece of wood and the appellant did the same.  It was at this time that 
Felix Gutierrez arrived from Naga City.  Edmundo Dualan told him that 
the appellant was asking for young coconuts.  (Vol. II, p. 150, t.s.n.) 
After being permitted by Felix Gutier­rez to get some young coconuts for
 the appellant, Edmundo Dualan went to his house to get a "kawit" or 
scythe with which to get the young coconuts.  When he went back to the 
copra shed, he told his companion and helper, Luis Saminiano, to gather 
young coconuts, and while Saminiano was gathering young coconuts, he 
stayed at the copra shed because it was rain­ing.  After the young 
coconuts were gathered by Saminiano, they tied them together in pairs.  
The appellant then instructed the two to load the young coconuts in the 
Cony.  After loading them at the rear compartment of the vehicle, 
Saminiano and Dualan went back to the copra shed.  When they returned, 
they found the appellant alone in the copra shed.  (Vol. II, p. 154, 
t.s.n.) At first Dualan was unmindful of the child whom he thought had 
been sent on an errand.  The appellant asked Dualan to get a spoon which
 he would use in eating young coconuts.  Dualan went to the house 
nearest the copra shed and borrowed a spoon.  When he returned to the 
copra shed and as he handed the spoon to the appellant, Dualan saw the 
child in the pit (Vol. II, p. 155, t.s.n.) which was about 3 meters 
deep, more or less.  This pit is the place where a fire is kindled in 
order to dry copra.  (Vol. II, p. 156, t.s.n.).  When Dualan saw the 
boy, he (boy) had his hands raised, waving, and uttering words which 
Dualan could not understand.  Upon seeing the boy in that condition, 
Dualan told the appellant that the child fell into the pit, so Luis 
Saminiano also ran and he and Dualan together pulled the boy out of the 
pit.  Appellant was just about 'isang dipa' from the pit and he merely 
said 'siyanga pala nahulog ang kasama ko'.  (Vol. p. 158, t.s.n.) 
Immediately after Dualan and Saminiano had pulled the boy out of the 
pit, the boy told the appellant 'I will report you to my father for 
having pushed me into the pit.' (Vol. II, p. 160, t.s.n.); the boy had a
 bleeding wound on his forehead.  According to Dualan, the child 
companion of the appellant was 8 years old, wearing white T-shirt, khaki
 short pants, white pair of socks and black pair of shoes (Vol. II, p. 
144, t.s.n.) Appellant did not answer the boy's statement that he would 
report to his father.  The appellant kept silent so, Dualan suggested to
 the appellant that he should bring the boy to a doctor, and appellant 
promised to do so.  Appellant warned Dualan not to tell Felix Gutierrez 
what had happened.  The appellant decided to leave and Dualan assisted 
the child in going back to the Cony.  With ap­pellant at the wheels of 
the Cony, they started on their way back. </p>
  <p> "As the appellant and the child were approaching the place where 
Jose Arandia had been left behind, the latter observed that the plate 
number at the front of the Cony was also changed.  The plate number was 
already 20-9.  (Vol. II, pp. 20-21, t.s.n.).  Appellant stopped the Cony
 and asked Arandia to drive the Cony again so that from then on, the 
latter drove the Cony with the child seated in between him and the 
appellant in the front seat.  (Vol. III, p. 25, t.s.n.).  Jose Arandia 
noticed that the T-shirt of the child had blood stains and there was a 
wound on his fore­head.  Arandia inquired as to what happened to the 
child, but both the appellant and the child remained silent.  On 
reaching Ratay Bridge, Jose Arandia was told to stop the Cony.  
Appellant alighted, went to the back of the Cony and removed the 
cardboard which he had placed to cover the true plate number of the 
Cony.  He then went to the front and did the same, after which he threw 
the two pieces of card­board down the bridge into the river.  (Vol. III,
 p. 26, t.s.n.).  Appellant returned to the Cony and urged Arandia to 
move on towards Naga.  On passing the Municipality of Bombon, but before
 reaching Magaras on the way to Naga, the appellant put a handkerchief 
into the boy's mouth to gag him.  Arandia stopped the Cony in order to 
help the appellant gag the boy (Vol. III, p. 27, t.s.n.), and tied the 
handkerchief at the back of the head of the child.  (Vol. III, p. 28, 
t.s.n.).  While the appellant was holding the boy with his right hand 
he, at the same time, pressed the child with his left shoulder to Jose 
Arandia.  (Vol. III, p. 29, t.s.n.).  After this, the appellant told 
Arandia to move on, so he started the Cony and proceeded towards the 
direction of Naga City.  On the way, appellant pushed the child in front
 to the floor of the Cony, obviously to hide the child from being seen 
from the outside.  While the boy was thus in a crawling position in 
front of the floor of the Cony, the appellant had his two legs above the
 child while his feet were resting on the front compartment of the Cony.
  At the same time, the appellant was holding the back portion of the 
T-shirt of the child with his right hand.  (Vol. III, p. 31, t.s.n.).  
On reaching the corner of Libaton and Bagumbayan streets, the appellant 
ordered Arandia to turn left and go to Pacol.  On reaching the place 
past the house of Judge Palacio, Arandia was ordered to turn around back
 to the direction a Naga City, which he did.  At this instance, 
appellant took the school bag of the child (Exh. I) from behind the 
front seat (Vol. III, p. 32, t.s.n.) and threw it on the right side of 
the road going to Naga.  Then they proceeded on their way.  On reaching 
Libaton street again, they turned right and then turned left at 
Bagumbayan.  On reaching P. Burgos street near the Holiday Hotel, they 
turned right towards Igualdad street, and then turned left.  On reaching
 Abella street, the ap­pellant told Aranda 'we are going to Camaligon, 
Joe', so the latter turned right on Abella street.  While they were in 
front of the Alatco compound at Abella street, a jeep overtook them, and
 as the light of the Cony hit the rear portion of the jeep, the 
appellant waved his hand signalling to Domingo and Angel Valencia who 
were seated at the rear portion of the jeep. </p>
  <p> "On reaching the crossing leading to the River Control Office in 
Camaligan, Arandia stopped the cony, but appellant told him 'it is not 
there Joe, it is further ahead'.  He backed the car and drove fur­ther 
ahead, and on reaching the crossing leading to the De Guzman compound, 
Jose Arandia saw Domingo and Angel Valencia 30 meters from the crossing.
  He stopped the Cony near the two and switched off the light upon 
instruction of the appellant.  Before the appellant alighted from the 
Cony, he told Arandia to return the vehicle.  Appel­lant then opened the
 door and alighted from the Cony and as he was getting his artificial 
arm from the vehicle's compartment, the child tried to escape and run 
towards the front of the Cony.  (Vol. III, p. 36, t.s.n.) But Domingo 
Valencia caught the left arm of the child while Angel Valencia caught 
his right arm.  Appellant ran towards them and hit the child with his 
artificial arm, hitting him on the head at a point 2 inches above his 
neck and the child quivered.  The appellant exclaimed, 'it is bet­ter to
 finish off the child because if we let him loose alive, he knows all of
 us'.  (Vol. III, p. 37, t.s.n.) On hearing this, Arandia drove away the
 Cony and saw Angel Valencia and Domingo Va­lencia carrying the child, 
with Domingo Valen­cia holding the child by his armpits and Angel 
Va­lencia holding the two legs of the child, towards the inside of the 
De Guzman Compound.  (Vol. II, pp. 36-38, t.s.n.) </p>
  <p> "In the meanwhile, when Raul Odiamar failed to return from school,
 his mother became worried.  She went to the town of Lagonoy that same 
evening to notify her husband, Samuel Odiamar, who was then in that 
town, that their child, Raul was missing.  Arriving that same evening in
 Naga City, they searched for Raul, going to the police precinct and 
then to the hospital.  Mrs. Odiamar made a public appeal on the radio 
about her missing son.  All these brought negative results.  The search 
for Raul continued the following morning, September 3, 1970.  About 9:00
 o'clock that morning the spouses Samuel and Luz Odiamar met and stopped
 the accused Angel Valencia and Armando Remo.  It was then that the 
Odiamars were informed by Angel Valencia of a ransom note con­tained in 
an envelope which Angel Valencia earlier delivered to the house of the 
Odiamars in San Agustin, Canaman.  It appears that earlier that morning,
 the letter which subsequently was found to contain a ransom note, and 
addressed to 'Mr. Samuel Odiamar, Cashier, Bicol Savings and Loan 
Association, Naga City' was found by the accused Bernardo Fiejoo inside 
the Office of the Bicol Savings and Loan Association (BISALA).  
Likewise, it appears that when Angel Valencia brought the letter to the 
house of Samuel Odiamar, the latter and his wife were not there and that
 the letter was opened, upon the insistence of accused Armando Remo in 
the presence of Mrs. Rosario Llaguno Veneracion, mother of Mrs. Odiamar.
  Samuel Odiamar read the letter.  A copy of the letter was subsequently
 made, which copy was brought to the Headquarters of the Philippine 
Constabulary.  A photostat copy is attached to the records of this case 
as Exhibit C and reads as follows: </p>
  <p> 'YOUR GOOD BOY IS IN GOOD HANDS… DON'T WORRY. </p>
  <p>
    'You are our number 5 client here in Camarines Sur, we expect the same full cooperation from you man.
  </p>
  <p>
    'INSTRUCTIONS:

    </p>
    <p> ‘Return this letter together with the money.  It’s part of the bargain Good Luck …’
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "While Samuel Odiamar was reading the ransom note, Angel Valencia 
was present and a little while later Remo arrived and took Samuel 
Odiamar to the kitchen.  Samuel told Remo to go to his sister Linda 
Odiamar and to inform Judge Llaguno.  The government authorities were 
likewise in­formed about the ransom note.  Col. Igual, the PC Provincial
 Commander in Camarines Sur called for a secret conference at Lindez 
Hotel and among those who attended were Remo, Angel Valencia and Mr. and
 Mrs. Samuel Odiamar.  In the conference, it was reported by Col. Igual 
that he had talked with a manager of a bank who would lend the amount of
 P20,000.00 in mutilated bills which will be used in paying the ransom 
money. </p>
  <p> "The following day, September 4, 1970, Samuel Odiamar was informed
 that there was a change of plan as the P20,000.00 mutilated bills would
 not be availa­ble.  Another Conference was held at the Complex Services
 in the office of Alfonso Ocampo.  In this conference, it was agreed 
that only P1,000.00 would be paid initially but the same would be 
accompanied with a letter of appeal. </p>
  <p> "In the meanwhile, still on September 3, 1970, at about 6:00 
o'clock p.m., Jose Arandia plied his route, driving again the same Cony 
(Exh. H).  About 9:00 o'clock p.m. that same day, the appellant rode in 
his Cony and told him 'you beware of imparting to the authority because 
the eyes of my companions are focused on you.  Lest the members of your 
family may be in danger'.  Arandia just answered 'no'.  After going 
around the poblacion of Naga City and on reaching the Holidal Hotel, the
 appellant disembarked while Arandia continued to ply his trade.  (Vol. 
III, pp. 43-44, t. s. n.) </p>
  <p> "The following day September 4, 1970, Jose Arandia drove the Cony 
and again plied his trade starting at 6:00 o'clock p.m.  (Vol. III, p. 
44, t.s.n.) At about 7:00 o'clock p.m. that night while driving near the
 Holiday Hotel, he was called by the appellant.  (Vol. III, p. 44, 
t.s.n.) Appellant was then near the monument of the 15 martyrs in front 
of the Holiday Hotel.  After having parked the Cony in front of the 
Holiday Hotel, the appellant approached Arandia and told him, he 
(appellant) would like to hire the car 'x x x, I will just be the one to
 drive it'.  Arandia told the appellant that he could not give the Cony 
to him because it was given to him by Baby (Graciano Badilla); however, 
he told the appellant that if the latter needed the car to just let him 
know and he would drive it.  It was then that the appellant told Arandia
 to park his Cony at 9:00 o'clock p.m. near the plaza of the 15 martyrs 
because he would need it (Vol. III, p. 45, t.s.n.) So, Arandia continued
 plying his route and about 9:00 o'clock p.m., more or less, he parked 
the Cony near the 15 martyrs monument in front of the Holiday Hotel as 
per instructions by the ap­pellant.  There, a male passenger boarded the
 Cony.  (Vol. III, p. 46, t.s.n.) He was wearing a white shirt with long
 sleeves, and colored pants.  (Vol. III, p. 47, t.s.n.) On instruction 
of the passenger, Arandia took him to Nordia near the cocktail lounge 
where his passenger disembarked and paid him P1.00.  This passenger was 
Samuel Odiamar.  (Vol III, p. 47, t.s.n.) Arandia re­turned to the 
Centre and parked near the Holiday Hotel near the 15 martyrs when 
another passenger boarded his Cony going to Nordia.  He brought him 
there and returned immediately to the centre (Vol. III, p. 48, t.s.n.), 
where he parked his Cony in front of the Holiday Hotel.  He alighted and
 talked with other drivers who were then around and while thus engaged 
in conversation with the other drivers, he saw something wrapped on the 
floor of his Cony on the right side near the rear seat.  (Vol. III, p. 
49, t.s.n.) He took the wrapped item, put it behind the driver's seat in
 front, and told the drivers with whom he was talking that he would 
first take coffee.  Arandia went to Concepcion Pequiña, to the Flying A 
Gasoline station and had his Cony placed on the wash rack.  (Vol. III, 
p. 50, t.s.n.) He took the wrapped bundle, opened it and found money in 
P20.00 bills and two envelopes inside a plastic bag.  He placed the two 
envelopes back inside the plastic bag together with the paper wrapping 
and threw it on the other side of the concrete wall.  The money, he 
placed under the upholstery of the front seat.  (Vol. III, p. 51, 
t.s.n.) He continued plying his route.  (Vol. III, p. 52, t.s.n.) </p>
  <p> "At around 5:30 A. M. of September 5, 1970, Arandia returned the 
Cony to the garage and went to Tinambacan, returning to Naga about 6:30 
p.m. of the same day.  (Vol. III, p. 72, t.s.n.) Arriving in his house 
that evening, he was told by his wife that the appellant went to their 
house demanding the P5.00 Arandia allegedly owed appellant.  Short­ly 
after Arandia finished eating his meal that eve­ning, Graciano Badilla 
arrived and informed him that the Cony was out of order and was at the 
Flying A Gasoline station, Arandia repaired the Cony and he and Graciano
 Badilla went together in the vehicle to the centre.  (Vol. p. 75, 
t.s.n.) On reaching near the Alex Theatre, Arandia alighted and went to 
the police precinct because Badilla told him that the police were 
looking for him.  He was investigated by Pat. Oliva regarding the 
alleged missing money.  There was no mention as to who owned the money. 
 After the investigation, Arandia went home.  (Vol. III, p. 74, t.s.n.) </p>
  <p> "About noon of September 6, 1970, Arandia brought the Cony to the 
garage after plying his trade (Vol. III, p. 75, t.s.n.) from 6:00 
o'clock A.M. that day.  While he was in the garage, the appellant 
arrived perspiring and Arandia asked him immediately what was that P5.00
 he was de­manding from his wife.  Appellant told him that was only an 
alibi because he had important matters to talk with Arandia.  The 
appellant then invited Arandia to the Cony (Vol. III, p. 76, t.s.n.) 
where they seated themselves facing each other.  The appellant told 
Arandia, 'Joe, I have here a letter, please read it carefully'.  Arandia
 took the letter from appellant (Vol. III, p. 77, t.s.n.) read it; after
 which, appellant took it back.  (Vol. III, p. 78, t.s.n.) The letter 
was inside an envelope, already opened and addressed to Jose Tukang, 
care of Cerilo de Leon (appellant).  Jose Tukang is Jose Arandia 
himself; that is his alias, his "bansag".  (Vol. III, p. 79, t.s.n.) The
 letter as recollected by Arandia on the witness stand was as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      'Dear Tukang, there was money purposely left in your car which you
 accidentally found.  That money belongs to the syndicate.  So that 
within twenty-four hours you deliver the money.  Tonight you should 
enter the Bichara Theater in the Balcony.  And sit yourself on the seat 
where there are nobody sitting beside you.  After leaving the money you 
leave the place after five minutes because there will be two persons to 
take it.  If the money is no longer in your possession or that you had 
given it to somebody it is your worry you will be dead at 12:00 Mafia' 
(Vol. III, p. 80, t.s.n. Brasal).'
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Arandia told the appellant that he had not found the money.  But the 
appellant answered 'that is your problem already'.  Then the appellant 
told Arandia to take him home which Arandia did.  Arandia took him to 
the Bello Building and brought the Cony back to the garage.  This 
conversation inside the Cony lasted for sometime.  According to Zenaida 
Badilla, sister-in-law of the appellant and wife of Graciano Badilla, 
they talked that time inside the Cony for more or less two hours.  (Vol.
 III, pp. 409-410, t.s.n.) After having conducted the appellant to the 
Bello Building, Arandia brought the Cony back to the garage.  (Vol. II, 
p. 81, t.s.n.) He was bothered about what the appellant had told him and
 because of the letter shown to him.  He was wondering what to do.  He 
decided to get the money from under the driver's seat of the Cony, took 
three P20.00 bills therefrom, and walked towards the centre (Vol. III, 
p. 82, t.s.n.) to look for the appellant near the place where the latter
 had alighted.  He saw Remo near the corner of the BISALA.  (Vol. III, 
p. 83, t.s.n.) When the appellant was leaving the Bello Building, 
Arandia approached him and stated 'Ciloy, there is the money'.  Arandia 
also told him, the money was only P950.00 because he (Arandia) spent 
part of it.  (Vol. III, p. 84, t.s.n.).  Appellant promised to take care
 of the matter and told Arandia that it was necessary for the latter to 
leave.  Arandia told the appellant that he could not leave because he 
had no money.  (Vol. III, p. 85, t.s.n.) Thereupon, appellant gave 
P250.00 for expenses, taken from the money Arandia had just given him.  
Arandia was about to leave when the appellant inquired where the 
wrappers of the money were, and Arandia stated he threw them over the 
bridge.  Appellant approved the action by saying 'good' (Vol. III, p. 
86, t.s.n.) and left.  Arandia proceeded to the supermarket (Vol. III, 
p. 87, t.s.n.) to the meeting of the drivers.  At the meeting, he was 
confused and restless, troubled whether to leave or not to leave.  (Vol.
 III, p. 88, t.s.n.) Arandia went to the Magdalena Apartment at 
Panganiban Street where his wife was then working and told her that he 
was leaving.  He went to Tinambac (Vol. III, p. 29, t.s.n.) and told his
 brother that the latter should take care of his family because he would
 be leaving, and he left for Manila.

  <p> "In the morning of September 10, 1970, the Naga City Police 
Department received a report that the dead body of a child was found 
along the irrigation ditch at Pacol within the vicinity of the residence
 of Ex-Vice Governor Odiamar.  (Vol. VI, p. 98, t.s.n.) Upon receipt of 
this report, Police Major Rey, together with the City Health Officer, 
Dr. Theo Santy, some Fiscals and some members of the Police Department 
went to Pacol.  The dead body was examined by Dr. Santy in the presence 
of Fiscal Vargas, Fiscal Rodriguez, and members of the police 
department.  The body was brought to the morgue of the Camarines 
Provincial Hospital for autopsy at about 8:30 to 9:30 A.M. of September 
10, 1970.  (Vol. VI, p. 99, t.s.n.) When the body of the dead child was 
already in the morgue, Major Rey of the Detective Bureau directed one of
 his men to get members of the Odiamar family, particularly Samuel and 
his wife, for the purpose of letting them view the body of the dead 
child and determine whe­ther it was the body of their missing son, Raul 
Odiamar.  Upon arriving at the morgue, Samuel Odiamar looked at the body
 and kept on tapping it while crying aloud, saying 'Raul, Raul, my son'.
  He identified the shoes, the khaki pants worn by the dead boy and the 
pieces of rubber bands.  (Vol. VI, p. 100, t.s.n.) In the morgue of the 
Camarines Sur Provincial Hospital, the body of Raul Odiamar was examined
 and autopsied by Dr. Theo Jame Santy, City Health Officer of Naga and 
Deputy NBI Medico-Legal Officer, Bicol Re­gion District Office, and Dr. 
Juan Dialago, Medico-Legal Officer for the province of Camarines Sur.  A
 necropsy report was made by them (Exh. S, p. 21, rec.) and according to
 the postmortem findings, the body was 48.5 inches high. </p>

  </p>
  <p> "Now let us go back to Jose Arandia.  When Jose Arandia left Naga 
on September 6, 1970 (Vol. III, p. 389, t.s.n.) he went to Cavite City 
via Camarines Norte and Pasay City.  (Vol. III, pp. 248-250, t.s.n.) By 
September 11, 1970, he was already in Cavite.  (Vol. III, p. 249, 
t.s.n.) While in Cavite City, Jose Arandia was fetched by Naga City 
Police Detectives Blando and Tuazon and brought to Naga City on 
September 25, 1970 where he was investigated.  (Vol. III, pp. 6, 
252-253, t.s.n.) He executed an affidavit (Exh. V) implicating the 
ap­pellant.  The contents of said affidavit were reite­rated by him on 
the witness stand.  (Vol. II, pp. 2-­90, Vol. III, pp. 1-16, t.s.n.) </p>
  <p> "On October 6, 1970, Amparo Ibasco, wife of Jose Arandia, upon 
arrival from Cavite, went to the Police Department, Naga City, to visit 
Arandia, (Vol. III, p. 461) From there, she proceeded to the Office of 
the Chief of Police of Pama, and turned over to him in the presence of 
Major Rey, the 'left over money' (meaning what was left of what Arandia 
gave her) amounting to P80.00 consisting of four 20 peso bills.  (Vol. 
III, pp. 461-464, t.s.n.) Chief of Police Pama gave her a receipt (Exh. 
P) to show that they received the sum of P80.00 in four 20 peso bills 
with their corresponding serial numbers stated on the receipt.  (Ibid; 
Exhs. F, F-1, F-2 and F-3) The serial numbers of these four twenty peso 
bills turned over to Chief Pama tallied with four of the serial numbers 
listed by Samuel Odiamar.  (Exh. E)" (Brief, pp. 2-25.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The appellant attributes only one error to the trial court, to wit:  
"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS HIS GUILT 
WAS NOT ESTABLISHED BY PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, IN DISREGARD OF 
HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT." (Brief, p. 27) and 
discusses this argument in just four pages.
</p><p>
The burden of the appellant's arguments is to attack the credibility of state witness Jose Arandia and Edmundo Dualan.
</p><p>
The appellant claims that Arandia was an accomplice hence his testimony 
comes from a polluted source and should not be believed.  He also avers 
that Arandia's testimony is "much too eloquent, so much so that either 
he was well rehearsed or just exceptionally brilliant."
</p><p>
True it is that Arandia's testimony comes from a polluted source.  But 
it does not follow that it is not admissible and competent.  (People vs.
 Aquino, L-27184, May 21, 1974, 57 SCRA 43.) What has to be done is 
scrutinize it carefully.  This the trial court did for it said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We have carefully scrutinized the testimony of Jose Arandia, 
without forgetting for a moment that Arandia was one of the accused in 
this case, but was discharged in order to be used as prosecu­tion 
witness.  We have therefore exercised the utmost care and caution in 
considering his tes­timony.  We have carefully watched his demeanor, his
 behavior, the manner he testified in Court, we have watched his eyes - 
the windows of his soul; we have intently listened to any change and 
variation in his voice, and on the whole, although he committed certain 
contradictions in his tes­timony, we found his testimony sufficiently 
reasonable." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 1150.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should also be stated that Arandia's testimony is partly corroborated
 by that of Edmundo Dualan who testified on what happened when the 
appellant brought Raul Odiamar to the coconut plantation of Felix 
Gutierrez, appellant's uncle, in Camuning.
</p><p>
The appellant's claim that Arandia's testimony is "much too eloquent" is
 not supported by the record.  Arandia was able to answer the questions 
posed to him because he was telling the truth.
</p><p>
The testimony of Edmundo Dualan is questioned on the sole ground that he
 did not identify the boy who was with the appellant as Raul Odiamar so 
that Raul's disappearance and eventual death cannot be laid to the door 
of the appellant.  This posture has no basis.
</p><p>
The appellant claims that the boy he brought to the Gutierrez' coconut 
plantation was his nephew, Reynaldo de Leon.  But on September 1, 1971, 
when Edmundo Dualan was recalled to the witness stand and Reynaldo de 
Leon was shown to him, he replied that Reynaldo was not the boy who was 
with the appellant.  This is what the transcript shows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "FISCAL VARGAS: </p>
  <p>
    During the testimony of Cerilo de Leon, he said and he admitted that
 he was at Camuning, Calabanga, Camarines Sur on September 2, 1970 with a
 boy; but, that boy, according to him is Reynaldo de Leon.  Reynaldo de 
Leon is now here in Court, and I would like you to see him.  We will 
request now, at this stage, that Reynaldo de Leon should come forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    (NOTE:  At this stage, Reynaldo de Leon was requested to stand up)
  </p>
  <p>
    Q - Will you tell us if this boy who stands up in the courtroom by 
the name of Reynaldo de Leon, will you tell us if that is the same boy 
whom you retrieved from the pit in the afternoon of September 2, 1970 at
 Camuning, Calabanga, Camarines Sur?
  </p>
  <p>
    A -   That is not the one because that is very small.
  </p>
  <p>
    (Vol. XIII - Defense, pp. 2483-2484.)
  </p>
  <p>
    On the positive side, Dualan identified the boy who was with the 
appellant as Raul by (a) describing his physical appearance and his 
attire; and (b) his resemblance to Raul's picture which was published in
 the <em>Bicol Mail</em>.  (TSN, Vol. II-Prosecution, pp. 141-149.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The bottom line in this appeal is who to believe.  Should the 
inculpatory and incriminatory evidence given by Jose Arandia and Edmundo
 Dualan prevail over the denial of the appellant that he had nothing to 
do with the asportation and death of Raul Odiamar?  The trial court 
concluded that Arandia and Dualan were more credible and We have no 
reason to disturb its conclusion for it was in a position to ascertain 
which of the witnesses were more credible.  This policy of appellate 
courts is axiomatic and is based on sound considerations.
</p><p>
The trial court correctly sentenced the appellant to suffer death but We
 cannot affirm the penalty because the necessary votes cannot be 
obtained.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is modified in respect of the
 penalty and indemnity in that the appellant shall suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 and indemnify the heirs of Raul Odiamar in the amount of Thirty 
Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos.  The rest of the judgment is affirmed.  
Costs against the appellant.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
