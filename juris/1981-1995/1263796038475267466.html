<p class="BODY"><span>Before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is a petition to review 
the judgment of the respondent Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R. No. 53258-R reversing the 
decision of the court <em>a quo</em> in Civil Case No. BN-109, entitled <span class="SpellE"><em>Dominico</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Etcuban</em></span><em> vs. Jesus G. Songalia, et. al.</em>, by 
ruling that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (petitioner herein) 
failed to avail <span class="GramE">himself</span> of the right of legal 
redemption within the period provided for by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Plaintiff inherited a piece of land with an area of 
approximately 14.0400 hectares together with his </span><span>co-heirs from 
their deceased father.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said piece of land was declared in their 
names as </span>heirs <span>of <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Etcuban</span> under Tax Declaration No. 06837 and was the subject 
matter in dispute in SP No. 1192-R, of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, a case for the settlement </span>of the estate of the 
late <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Etcuban</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In said case, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dominico</span> <span class="SpellE">Etcuban</span>, the spouse of 
the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> <span class="SpellE">Initan</span>, and Pedro, Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span>, Alfonso, <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anunciacion</span>, Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, all 
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Etcuban</span> were declared as co-owners of the 
property in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the 11 co-heirs executed in favor 
of defendants (private respondents herein) 11 deeds of sale of their respective 
shares in the co-ownership for the total sum of P26<span class="GramE">,340</span>.00.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>It is not disputed that the 
earliest of the 11 deeds of sale was made on </span><st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1963"><span>December 9, 1963</span></st1:date><span> and the last one in 
December 1967.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Annexes "1 - 11").<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In his complaint before the trial court, plaintiff alleged 
that his co-owners leased and/or sold their respective shares without giving due 
notice to him as a co-owner notwithstanding his intimations to them that he was 
willing to buy all their respective shares.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>He further 
maintained that even upon inquiry from his co-heirs/co-owners, and also from the 
alleged buyers (defendants) he elicited nothing from them.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Plaintiff discovered for the first time the existence of these 11 deeds 
of sale during the hearing on <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1972">January 
31, 1972</st1:date> of Civil Case No. BN-87, entitled <em>Jesus C. Songalia vs. 
Dominico</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Etcuban</em></span> in the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu<em>, Branch XI</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>When he verified the 
supposed sales with his co-owners only 3 of them admitted their respective 
sales.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the filing of Civil Case 
No.</span> <span class="GramE"><span>BN-109 by petitioner for legal 
redemption.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Defendants (private respondents herein) in denying the material 
allegations of the complaint, argued by way of affirmative and special defenses 
that plaintiff has no cause of action against them; that the action is barred by 
prescription or <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; that the complaint is barred 
by the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. BN-87 involving the 
same parties, same subject matter and same cause of action; that the provisions 
of the law pertaining to legal redemption have been fully complied with in 
respect to the sale of the disputed land to them; that plaintiff came to know of 
the sale of the land in question to them in August, 1968 or sometime prior 
thereto; that acting on this knowledge, plaintiff thru his lawyers wrote 
defendants on August 15, 1968 about the matter; that Jesus <span class="SpellE">Songalia</span> personally went to the office of Atty. Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Faelner</span> or counsel for plaintiff to inform him of the 
sale of the disputed land to them; that again another demand letter was received 
on May 30, 1969 by defendants from the lawyers of plaintiff but on both 
occasions, no action was taken by plaintiff despite the information plaintiff 
received from defendants thru his counsel and that consequently plaintiff lost 
his right to redeem under Art. 1623 of the new Civil Code because the right of 
redemption may be exercised only within 30 days from notice of sale and 
plaintiff was definitely notified of the sale years ago as shown by the 
records.</p>
<p class="BODY">During the pre-trial conference, the parties failed to agree on 
any stipulation of facts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Judgment was rendered after due trial 
with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> 
<span>portion:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, JUDGMENT is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against 
the defendants as follows:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>Allowing the plaintiff to exercise his right of redemption over the land in 
question;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants to accept the redemption price of P26,340.00 which 
plaintiff should deposit with this Court within 30 days from and after this 
decision becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and thereafter to 
execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in favor of the 
plaintiff and to surrender the possession and ownership of the property in 
question to the plaintiff; and<span><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li><span class="GramE"><span></span>The</span> defendants are ordered to pay the 
costs."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></li></ol>
<p class="BODY">Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals assigning several 
errors but the appellate court centered its dissertation on the first assignment 
of error as <span>the issue to be most decisive and, therefore confined its 
discussion to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Defendants in their first assignment of error assailed the lower 
court in not holding that the failure of the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to tender to the defendants-appellants the 
redemption price or to consign the same in court or to make a specific offer to 
redeem the property before filing the complaint for legal redemption has barred 
the <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> right to redeem the property pursuant 
to the doctrine of the Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Conejero</em></span><em> vs. Court of Appeals</em> (16 SCRA 
775).</p>
<p class="BODY">The appellate court in tackling this issue declared that plaintiff 
failed to make a valid tender of the sale price of the land paid by the 
defendants within the period fixed by Art. 1623 of the Civil Code which provides 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"ART. 1623.<span>&nbsp; </span>The right of legal pre-emption or 
redemption shall not be exercised except within thirty (30) days from the notice 
in writing by the prospective vendor, or by the vendor, as the case may 
be.<span>&nbsp; </span>The deed of sale shall not be recorded in the Registry of 
Property, unless accompanied by an affidavit of the vendor that he has given 
written notice thereof to all possible <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The right of redemption of co-owners excludes that of adjoining 
owners.<span>&nbsp; </span>(1524a)"</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The respondent court found that written notice was given to 
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in the form of an answer with 
counterclaim to the complaint in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">BN-109 which 
appears on the records to have been filed on </span></span><st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1972"><span class="GramE"><span>March 18, 
1972</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Said court ruled that 
"this notice is sufficient to inform the plaintiff about the sale and the 
reckoning date for the 30-day period commenced upon receipt thereof.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>No other notice is needed under the premises because it is the substance 
conveyed rather than the form embodying <span class="GramE">it, that</span> 
counts."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The records reveal that on </span><st1:date month="5" day="27" year="1974"><span>May 27, 1974</span></st1:date><span>, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> deposited with the lower court the amount of 
P26<span class="GramE">,340.00</span> the redemption price.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since 
the answer with counterclaim was filed on </span><st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1972"><span>March 18, 1972</span></st1:date><span>, the deposit made on 
</span><st1:date month="5" day="27" year="1974"><span>May 27, 
1974</span></st1:date><span> was clearly outside the 30-day period of legal 
redemption. <span>&nbsp;</span>The period within which the right of legal redemption 
or preemption may be exercised is non-extendible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioner contends that vendors (his co-heirs) should be 
the ones to give him written notice and not the vendees (defendants or private 
respondent herein) citing the case of </span><st1:city><span class="style2"><st1:place>Butte</st1:place></span></st1:city><span style="font-style: italic;"> vs. Manuel Uy &amp; Sons, Inc</span><span>. 4 SCRA 
526.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such contention is of no moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>While 
</span>it is true that written notice is required by the law (Art. 1623), it is 
equally true that the same "Art. 1623 does not prescribe any particular form of 
notice, <span class="GramE">nor</span> any distinctive method for notifying the 
<span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>." So long, therefore, as the latter is 
informed <span>in writing of the sale and the particulars thereof, </span>the 30 
days for redemption start <span class="GramE">running,</span> and the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> has no real cause to complain. <span class="GramE">(<em>De Conejero et al v. Court of Appeals, et al </em>16 SCRA 
775).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Conejero</span> case, <span class="GramE">We</span> ruled that the furnishing of a copy of the disputed deed 
of sale to the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, was equivalent to the 
giving of written notice required by law in "a more authentic manner than any 
other writing could have done," and that We cannot adopt a stand of having to 
sacrifice substance to technicality.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">More so in 
the case at bar, where the vendors or co-owners of petitioner stated under oath 
in the deeds of sale.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>(Annexes "1 to 11") that notice of 
sale had been given <span>to prospective <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span> 
in accordance with Art. <span class="GramE">1623 of the Civil Code.</span><span>&nbsp; 
</span>"A sworn statement or clause in a deed of sale to the effect that a 
written notice of sale was given to possible <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span> or co-owners might be used to determine 
whether an offer to redeem was made on or out of time, or whether there was 
substantial compliance with the requirement of said Art. 1623.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In </span><span>resume, <span class="GramE">We</span> find 
that petitioner failed to subs</span>tantially comply with the requirements of 
Art. 1623 on legal redemption and <span class="GramE">We</span> see no reason to 
reverse the assailed decision of the respondent Court.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>WHEREFORE</span></b><span>, premises considered, the 
petition is hereby DISMISSED and the appealed decision is hereby
