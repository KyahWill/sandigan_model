CA-G.R. No. 50076-R, entitled "<em>EMILIO BERNABE SR., et al. v. REPUBLIC OF THE

Cadastral Record No. 1097, which dismissed petitioner Republic's petition for 
review of the decrees of registration issued pursuant to the decision rendered 
on December 17, 1968 adjudicating in favor of the private Respondents herein, 
the lots applied for by them, and the Resolution of Respondent Court dated March 
19, 1975 denying herein Petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>The undisputed facts are as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>Lot No. 622 of the <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span> Cadastre was declared public land in a <span class="GramE">decision</span> rendered before the last war in Cadastral Case No.

<p class="BODY" align="justify">On <st1:date month="7" day="6" year="1965">July 6, 
1965</st1:date>, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 622 was segregated from the forest 
zone and released and certified by the Bureau of Forestry as an agricultural 
land for disposition under the Public Land Act (Record on Appeal, p. 7).</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">On April 26, 1967, Respondents filed in the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> a petition to reopen 
Cadastral Case No. 19, LRC Cadastral Record No. 1097, under Republic Act 931, as 
amended by Republic Act 2061, concerning a portion of Lot No. 622 — Lot Nos. 
792, 793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798 — and a <span>portion </span>of Lot No. 324 — 
Lot Nos. 791 and 799 — more particularly identified and delineated in the 
segregation plans of Sgs-3<span>3</span>43, Sgs-3440, Sgs-3340, Sgs-3341, 
Sgs-3342 and Sgs-3339, approved by the Director of Lands, to perfect their 
rights and register their titles to said lots, having allegedly acquired 
ownership and possession of said parcels of land by purchase from the original 
owners thereof, whose possession of the same including that of the herein 
Respondents, has always been continuous, open, active, exclusive, public, 
adverse, and in the concept of owners thereof for more than 30 years (Record on 
Appeal, pp. 3-5 and 11).</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">On May 17, 1967, the lower court issued an Order 
setting the petition for hearing and directing that the Republic of <span>the 
Philippines be notified thereof by furnishing the Solicitor-General, the 
Director of Lands and the Director of Forestry, </span><span>a </span><span>copy 
</span><span>of </span><span>said Order together with Respondents' petition by 
registered mail (Record on Appeal, p. 6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>On August 24, 1967, the Director of Forestry 
filed an opposition to the petition praying for the denial of the petition once 
the area involved is found to be within the timberland and therefore inalienable 
under the Constitution (Record on Appeal, p. 7).<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon 
verification, however, the Director of Forestry found the area to be the portion 
of the timberland already released by the government from the mass of public 
forests and promptly withdrew his Opposition (Record on Appeal, p. 
8).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>On September 1, 1967, the Acting Provincial 
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, for and in behalf of the Director of 
Lands, filed his opposition to the petition alleging that the land is still, in 
truth and in fact, public land and as such cannot be the subject of a land 
registration proceeding under Act 496.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>The lower court found that the petitioners

</span><span>petition </span><span>for review of the decrees of registration 
under Section 38, of Act No. 496, as amended, and the corresponding decision of 
the lower court, on the grounds that the entire proceeding was vitiated by lack 
of notice to the Solicitor-General of the subsequent hearings of the petition 
for re-opening of the cadastral proceedings; that the parcels of land subject 
matter of the petition to re-open cadastral proceedings are portions of the 
public domain, admittedly within the unclassified public forest of <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, opened for 
disposition only on or about July 6, 1965; that subsequently, respondents do not 
have </span><span>a </span><span class="SpellE"><span>registerable</span></span><span> title to the land subject 
matter of the proceedings; and the lower court, without jurisdiction to decree 
the confirmation of <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> title to respondents 
over portions of the public domain, as respondents do not qualify under the 
provisions of Section 48(b) of CA 141, as amended, and that under the 
circumstances, respondents employed actual fraud in procuring title over the 
parcels of land (Record on Appeal, p. 25).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dismiss the Petition for Review on the grounds that:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="GramE">The</span> trial court has </span>no jurisdiction over the nature of 
the action or suit as there is no fraud to justify the setting aside on review 
of a decree of registration.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the Solicitor-General was not

to the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Besides the setting aside or review was filed out of time.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(2) The petition states no cause of action, the parcels of land involved 
in the actions having been already transferred to innocent purchasers for value 
long before the Solicitor-General even filed the petition for review (Record on

fraudulently secured title over the parcels of land involved, the petitioners 
executed simulated deeds of sale purporting to convey various lots composing 
portions of the parcels involved to third parties for fictitious considerations 
in an obvious attempt to remove the parcels of land involved from the coverage 
of Section 38 of Act 496, but in truth, the aforementioned third parties are not 
innocent purchasers for value, being mere dummies of the petitioners, holding

<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>It is evident from the facts of the case at 
bar that private respondents did file a claim for Lot No. 622 of the <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span> Cadastre and in fact a decision was rendered 
before the last war in Cadastral Case No. 19 LRC Cadastral Record No. 1097, 
declaring the lot in question as public land.<span>&nbsp; </span>It must be stressed 
that said lot was declared public land by virtue of a court decision which has 
become final and as held by the Supreme Court aforesaid decision is <span class="SpellE"><em>res</em></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><em>judicata</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE"><span>(<em>Republic v.

the trial court has no jurisdiction to reopen the cadastral proceeding under 
R.A. 931 as amended by R.A. 2061 and the decision therein rendered is null and 
void <span class="SpellE"><em>ab</em></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><em>initio</em></span><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>Furthermore, it is undisputed that aforesaid 
Lot No. 622 was released as an agricultural land for disposition under Public 
Land Act only on </span><st1:date month="7" day="6" year="1965"><span>July 6, 
1965</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The lower court ordered the issuance 
of the corresponding decrees of registration for the lots, pursuant to Sec. 
48(b), C.A. 141, otherwise known as the Public Land Act, as amended by Republic 
Act No. 1942, providing for the confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles, 
which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<div align="justify">
<blockquote>"(b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those who by themselves or through their 
predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious 
possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a 
<em>bona fide</em> claim of acquisition of ownership, for <span>at least 
</span>thirty years immediately preceding the filing of the application for 
confirmation of title except when prevented by war or force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>These shall be conclusively presumed 
to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant <span>and 
shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this 
chapter."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote></div>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>As pointed out by petitioner, the question is 
whether or not the lots claimed by respondents could legally be the subject of a 
judicial confirmation of title under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> 
provisions of the Public Land Act, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>The answer is in the 
negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>Section 48(b) of C.A. No. 141, as amended, 
applies exclusively to public agricultural land.<span>&nbsp; </span>Forest lands or 
areas covered with forests are excluded.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are incapable of 
registration and their inclusion in a title, whether such title <span class="GramE">be</span> one issued during the Spanish sovereignty or under the 
present Torrens system of registration, nullifies the title (<em>Li Seng</em> 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Giap</em></span><em> v. Director of Lands</em>, 55 Phil. 
693 [1931]; <em>Director of Lands v. Reyes</em>, 68 SCRA 177 [1975]).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thus, possession of forest lands, however long, cannot ripen into private 
ownership (<span class="SpellE"><em>Vano</em></span><em> v. Government</em>, 41 
Phil. 161 [1920]; <em>Adorable v. Director of Forestry</em>, 107 Phil. 401 
[1960]; </span><span><em>Director of Forestry v. Munoz</em>, 23 SCRA 1183 
[1968]; <em>Director of Lands v. Abanzado</em>, 65 SCRA 5 [1975]).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A parcel of forest land is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Bureau of Forestry and beyond the power and jurisdiction of the cadastral court 
to register under the Torrens System (<em>Republic v. Court of Appeals</em>, 89 
SCRA 648 [1979]; <em>Republic v. Vera</em> (120 SCRA 210 [1983]; <em>Director of 
Lands v. Court of Appeals</em>, 129 SCRA 689 [1984].<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>Thus, even if the reopening of the cadastral 
proceedings was at all possible, private respondents have not qualified for a 
grant under Sec. 48(b) of Commonwealth Act 141, the facts being that private 
respondents could only be credited with 1 year, 9 months and 20 days possession 
and occupation of the lots involved, counted from July 6, 1965, the date when 
the land area in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> San Jose, barrio <span class="SpellE">Cabcaban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, known as <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> PMD No. 
267, which includes the lots claimed by respondents, had been segregated from 
the forest zone and released by the Bureau of Forestry as an agricultural land 
for disposition under the Public Land Act.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, p. 19).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, under 
the above mentioned jurisprudence, neither private respondents nor their 
predecessors-in-interest could have possessed the lots for the requisite period 
of thirty (30) years as disposable agricultural land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" align="justify">Petitioner argues that the government, being a 
necessary party in the cadastral case, as reopened, its counsel, the 
Solicitor-General, should have been furnished copies of all court orders, 
notices and decisions, as in ordinary cases, in order to bind the 
government.<span>&nbsp; </span>Failure to give such notice deprives the State of its 
day in Court, and renders the decision void.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Brief for Petitioner, pp. 16-17).</span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">The records show that the Solicitor-General was duly 
notified of the initial hearing on the petition to reopen Cadastral Case No. 19 
but thereafter, notice of subsequent hearings as well as a copy of the decision 
itself promulgated by the lower <span>court on </span>December 19, 1968 was sent 
instead to the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, admittedly 
the duly authorized representative of the Solicitor-General in the cadastral 
proceeding <span>as shown in a telegram dated January 19, 1968.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, p. 47).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>In the case of <em>Republic v. Director of 
Lands</em> (71 SCRA 426 [1976], the Supreme Court, applying the time-honored 
principle </span>of agency ruled that the service of the questioned decision on 
the Provincial Fiscal must necessarily be service on the Solicitor- General, and 
added that technical transgressions relative to the filing and service may be 
brushed aside when the adverse party (this time the Director of Lands and 
Forestry and their counsel, the Solicitor-General) is aware of the matter which 
his adversary would want the court to act upon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once it appears 
that the party is already informed by one means or another of what he is to be 
notified, the required service becomes an empty gesture and strict observance 
thereof is considered waived.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Citing 
<em>Estrada v. Sto.</em></span> <span class="GramE"><em>Domingo</em>, 28 SCRA 890 
[1969]).</span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>In the case at bar, it does not appear that 
the Solicitor-General was so apprised of the decision of the lower court in 
question as there is no proof that the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> ever sent the Solicitor-General a copy 
thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, after the 3rd Assistant Provincial Fiscal 
filed a notice of appeal from the decision of the trial court, the Provincial 
Fiscal on </span><st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1969"><span>March 21, 
1969</span></st1:date><span> manifested that he was withdrawing the appeal upon 
the intervention of the District Forester.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Respondent's Brief, p. 44).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>It will be observed however that later 
decisions of </span>the Supreme Court tend to be <span class="GramE">more 
strict</span> in the matter of giving notice to the Solicitor-General.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In a more recent case, <em>Republic v. Court of Appeals</em>, 135 SCRA 
161 [1985], it was established that the Solicitor-General is the only legal 
counsel of the government in land registration cases and as such, he alone may 
withdraw the Government's appeal with binding effect on the latter.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He is entitled to be furnished copies of all court orders, notices and

period for appeal should be reckoned from the time <span>the Solicitor-General's 
Office is apprised of the 1970 order of denial and not from the time the special 
counsel or the fiscal was served with that order.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, 
representatives </span><span>of </span><span>the Solicitor-General in the case 
at bar, had no power to decide whether or not an appeal should be made.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They should have referred the matter to the Solicitor-General and without 
copies of court orders, notices and decisions, having been provided by either 
the trial court or the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> to 
the Solicitor-General, the assailed decision has no binding effect on the 
government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

after the issuance of aforesaid decrees of registration, on the ground of actual 
fraud.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal pp. 
43-44).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>The basic elements for the allowance of the 
reopening or review of a decree, are:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) that the petitioner has 
real or dominical right; (2) that he has been deprived thereof through 
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">fraud</span><span>; (3) that the 
petition is filed within one year from the issuance of the decree and (4) that 
the property has not as yet been transferred to an innocent purchaser.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Libudan</em></span><em> v. 
Gil</em>, <span>45 </span>SCRA 27 [1972]<span>; </span><span class="SpellE"><em>Rubico</em></span><em>, et al. v. Orellana</em>, 30 SCRA 513 
[1969]).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>It has been held however that the action to annul 
a judgment, upon the ground of fraud would be unavailing unless the fraud <span class="GramE">be</span> extrinsic or collateral and the facts upon which it is 
based have not been <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> or resolved in the 
case where the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Libudan</em></span><em> v. Gil, 
supra</em><span>).</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span>Review of the decree demands a 
showing of actual (not constructive) fraud,<em> i.e.</em> actual malice.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rublico</em></span><em> v. 
Orellana</em> <span>(<em>supra</em>).</span></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">In the case at bar, it cannot be said that private 
respondents employed actual fraud in procuring titles over parcels of land of 
the public domain as it is a matter of record that the land in question was 
opened for disposition and alienation only on <st1:date month="7" day="6" year="1965">July 6, 1965</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The matter was threshed out 
in the lower court and the decision of the latter was affirmed by the Court of 
Appeals.<span>&nbsp; </span>Actual malice is therefore absent.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">However, it has been held that, if a decree issued 
in pursuance of a valid decision, obtained by fraud, may be annulled within one 
(1) year from entry of said decree, there is more reason to hold that the same 
is true if entered in compliance with a decision suffering from a fatal 
infirmity, such as want of due process, (<span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de Cuaycong v. Vda. de Sangbengco</em>, 
110 Phil. 118 [1960] or lack of jurisdiction of the court that decided the 
cadastral case.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Republic v. De 
Kalintas</em>, 25 SCRA 720 [1969]).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, on both counts, 
the case at bar can properly be the subject of review, it having been shown that 
the Solicitor-General was not properly furnished the requisite notices and copy 
of the assailed decision but more importantly, the lower court as previously 
stated had no jurisdiction to re-open the cadastral proceeding under Republic 
Act 931 as amended by R.A. No. 2061.</p>

<p class="BODY" align="justify">As to whether or not the transferees of the lot in 
question are innocent purchasers for value, it is a well settled rule that a 
purchaser cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man upon 
his guard, and then claim <span>that he acted in good faith under the belief 
that there was no defect in the title of the vendor.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Leung Yee v. F. L. Strong Machiner Co., et al.</em>, 37 Phil. 
651 [1918].</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Without the needed verification, he cannot 
claim to be an innocent purchaser for value in contemplation of 
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>Moreover, it is well-settled that</span> 
<span>a certificate of title is void, when it covers property of public domain 
classified as forest or timber and mineral lands.<span>&nbsp; </span>Any title issued 
on non-disposable lots <em>even in the hands of an alleged innocent purchaser 
for value</em></span><span>, shall be cancelled.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated Mining Company v. 
<span class="SpellE">Dumyung</span>, 89 SCRA 540 <i>[</i>1979<i>]</i> <span style="font-style: italic;">underscoring supp</span><em>lied</em>).</span><span>&nbsp; 
</span>In the case at bar, it will be noted that in granting titles to the land 
in dispute, the lower court counted the period of possession of private 
respondents before the same were released as forest lands for disposition, which 
release is tantamount to qualifying the latter to a grant on said lands while 
they were still non-disposable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, under the foregoing rulings, 
even assuming that the transferees are innocent purchasers for value, their 
titles to said lands derived from the titles of private respondents which were 
not validly issued as they cover lands still a part of the public domain, may be 
cancelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
