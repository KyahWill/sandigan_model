				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. JESUS ARLEGUI, JUDGE - COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BATANGAS, BRANCH VII, AND WILLIAM ESPAÑOLA, RESPONDENTS. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
This is a petition for review on certiorari of the order of the Court of
 First Instance of Batangas, Branch VII, dismissing on a motion to quash
 Criminal Case No. 2170 entitled "People of the Philippines v. William 
Espanola" on the ground that from the language used in the information 
in relation to the Presidential Decrees punishing the alleged offense, 
it is not clear that an offense was committed and that the supposed 
penal statutes "are not prohibitive but rather permissive and preceptive
 statutes."
<p>
Respondent Española was charged in an information which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The undersigned Third Assistant Provincial Fiscal accuses William
 Espanola of the violation of Presidential Decree No. 381 in relation to
 Section 4-B of Presidential Decree No. 189, as amended, committed as 
follows: </p>
  <p> "That during the month of May 1979 and continuously up to the 
present, at Sitio Putat, Barangay Papaya, Municipality of Nasugbu, 
Province of Batangas, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there, wilfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously and without authority of law, establish, 
construct, manage and operate development projects for tourism purposes 
on a land under the administration and supervision of the Philippine 
Tourism Authority, a government corporate body charged with the planning
 and development of tourism projects, and situated in Putat, Nasugbu, 
Batangas, containing an area of 30,000 square meters, more or less, 
otherwise known as the Peco de Loro Beach Resort, without the prior 
approval of the said Authority."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Respondent Española moved to quash the information on the following grounds:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The accusation against the accused is <em>not </em>a penal 
offense, but, more of administrative in nature, because Sec. 4 of P.D. 
No. 381 as well as P.D. No. 189, Sec. 4-B do not impose Criminal 
liability against the offender.  The accused did not commit any offense 
in the development of the beach resort because his application, granting
 that the area is within the jurisdiction of the Philippine Tourism 
Authority, was duly given due course by the said body as stated in <em>Annex 'A'.</em>
  Instead of charging the accused, he ought to be commended for 
assisting the government in the promotion of tourism.  In fact, the 
beach resort has become so famous that foreigners have been continuously
 and regularly patronizing the place. </p>
  <p> "The land covered by the beach resort was also given due course by
 the Bureau of Lands and covered by a Foreshore Lease Application as 
clearly reflected in <em>Annexes 'B' and 'C'.</em>"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The grounds in the Fiscal's opposition to the motion to quash are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.     That the accused has overlooked the fact that Presidential
 Decree No. 381 which was made principally as the basis of the charge 
against the herein accused provides under Section 1 thereof <em>'that no development project for tourism purposes shall</em> be undertaken by any person without prior approval of the <em>Philippine Tourism Authority, in accordance with the provisions and guidelines prescribed by the Department of Tourism</em>.'
 As a corollary thereto, Section 4 provides ‘that any person violating 
or causing another to violate any provision of this decree or the rules 
and regulations promulgated by the Philippine Tourism Authority pursuant
 to the next preceding section will suffer the penalties provided for 
under Section 4-B of P.D. No. 189, as amended.  Presidential Decree No. 
259 which took effect on August 1, 1973 which among others provides the 
penalties for the violation of any provision of the said decree or of 
the rules and regulations or circulars of the Department of Tourism is 
now known as Section 4-B of PD No. 189.  Section 4-b has been misquoted 
because Section 4 of PD No. 189 was the one quoted by the accused.  
Section 4-b as we have stated is an amendment to Section 4 of PD No. 189
 which section is now included under PD 259 as an amendatory act to PD 
No. 189. </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "2.     That it is not true that the Philippine Tourism Authority 
gave due course to the application of the accused for the undertaking of
 a particular development project at Sitio Putat, Barangay Papaya, 
Nasugbu, Batangas, for tourism purposes because the letter itself dated 
February 14, 1979 does not indicate approval of the authority of his 
application in the sense that the implications of the phrase <em>'we may give due course to your proposal</em>‘ do not altogether give a guarantee and assurance to the accused that his application will be approved.  x x x”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Complainant Philippine Tourism Authority likewise interposed an opposition to the motion to quash and argued:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The charge against the accused is an offense punishable by Special Law, P.D. 381, the penalty of which is provided in <em>Section 4-B</em>
 of P.D. 189, as amended by P.D. 259.  It should be noted that P.D. 189 
has been amended by P.D. 259 in which Section 4-B was specifically 
incorporated providing for the penalty of any violation of P.D. 381.  
The citation of the accused of Sec. 4-b (not capitalized) of P.D. 189, 
as supposed to be providing the penalty as mentioned by P.D. 381 is an 
error because P.D. 381 mentions Sec. 4-B (capitalized letter) of P.D. 
189 <em>as amended</em> particularly by P.D. No. 259.  x x x </p>
  <p> "The allegation of the accused that he did not commit the offense 
because his application for beach resort was duly given due course by 
the Authority, is a matter of defense which, at this stage, is 
misleading and definitely not a ground for a Motion to Quash.  x x x"
  </p>
  <p>
    The respondent court, in a twelve-page order resolved to dismiss the
 case.  The prosecution, through the Provincial Fiscal and the 
Philippine Tourism Authority, raised the matter to this Court in this 
petition and made the following assignments of errors:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">
      (i)
    </p>
    <p>
      Respondent Lower Court erred in resorting to interpretation and 
construction of the information and the law subject of violation despite
 the unambiguous provisions thereof.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      (ii)
    </p>
    <p>
      Respondent Lower Court erred in declaring P.D. 381 as a permissive
 statute despite the mandatory nature of the provisions and the penalty 
provided for violation thereof.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      (iii)
    </p>
    <p>
      Respondent Lower Court erred in dismissing Criminal Case No. 2170.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Asked to comment on the case at bar, the Solicitor General stated that 
the respondent judge did not properly apply the correct provisions of 
the law allegedly violated by the private respondent and agreed with the
 prosecution that P.D. No. 381 is not a permissive statute and violation
 of its provisions constitutes a criminal offense.
</p><p>
The pertinent provisions of P.D. No. 381 (Requiring the Approval of the 
Philippine Tourism Authority on Certain Development Projects and Loans 
Applied for to Finance their Construction, etc.) are -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Section 1.  Any provision of existing laws, decrees, or rules to the
 contrary notwithstanding, no development project for tourism purposes 
shall be undertaken by any person without the prior approval of the 
Philippine Tourism Authority, in accordance with the policies and 
guidelines prescribed by the Department of Tourism.
  </p>
  <p>
    xxx                xxx                   xxx
  </p>
  <p>
    Section 4.  Any person violating or causing another to violate any 
provision of this decree or of the rules and regulations promulgated by 
the Philippine Tourism Authority pursuant to the next preceding section 
shall suffer the penalties provided under <em>Section 4-B of Presidential Decree No. 189, as amended.</em>  (Italics supplied).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Section 4-b (not capitalized) of P.D. No. 189 (Amending Part IX Of The 
Integrated Reorganization Plan by Renaming the Department of Trade and 
Tourism as the Department of Trade, and Creating the Department of 
Tourism with a Philippine Tourism Authority attached to it in lieu of 
Philippine Tourism Commission) provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Section 4.  <em>Functions</em>. - The Department shall be responsible for the following functions:
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p>
    b.  Effect the removal of unnecessary barriers to travel; the 
integration and simplification of travel regulations; as well as their 
efficient, fair and courteous enforcement to assure expeditious and 
hospitable reception of all visitors;
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p>
    P.D. No. 189 was later amended by P.D. No. 259 (Amending Certain 
Provisions of Presidential Decree No. 189 dated May 11, 1973).  Section 2
 of the latter decree provides that:
  </p>
  <p>
  SECTION 2.  To provide penalties for the violation of any provision of
 the said Decree or of the rules and regulations or circulars of the 
Department of Tourism, <em>a new section to be known as Section 4-B is hereby added</em>, which shall read as follows:  (Italics supplied)
  </p>
  <p> SEC. 4-B.  Any person violating or causing another to violate any 
provision of this Decree, or of the rules and regulations or circulars 
promulgated by the Department of Tourism pursuant to its power and 
authority to license, classify, regulate and/or supervise the operation 
of all persons, businesses, establishments, facilities and services that
 cater to, or have anything to do with travelers and tourists, both 
international and domestic shall, upon conviction by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less 
than two (2) years nor more than five (5) years or a fine of not less 
than two thousand pesos nor more than five thousand pesos, or both, at 
the discretion of the Court.  In addition thereto, such violation shall 
ipso facto, constitute a valid ground for the revocation of all 
privileges, permits and authorization granted to such person or entity 
under this Decree by the Department of Tourism.  Provided, however, That
 if the offender is a corporation, firm, partnership or association, the
 penalty shall be imposed upon the guilty officer or officers, as the 
case may be, of the corporation, firm or association, and if such guilty
 officer or officers is an alien, in addition to the penalties herein 
prescribed, he or they shall be deported without further proceedings on 
the part of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We purposely emphasize that there are two sections numbered almost 
identically, one with a capitalized "B" and the other with a 
non-capitalized "b", ("Section 4-B" and "Section 4-b") since these 
sections caused the confusion encountered by the respondent court and 
the misreading and misapplication of the law.  The two sections must be 
distinguished from each other.  Under "Section 4-b" of P.D. No. 189, the
 Department of Tourism was empowered to "effect the removal of 
unnecessary barriers to travel; the integration and simplification of 
travel regulations; as well as their efficient, fair, and courteous 
enforcement to assure expeditious and hospitable reception of all 
visitors.” It does not provide for any penalty, much more impose any 
criminal liability.  To that extent respondent Española was correct when
 he said that the provision was not a penal offense but that it was more
 administrative in nature.  The respondent court citing Section 4-b (not
 capitalized) of P.D. No. 189, arrived at the same conclusion.
</p><p>
However, P.D. No. 189 has been amended by P.D. No. 259 and a new 
provision, Section 4-B, added.  Moreover, the information clearly and 
expressly accuses respondent Española for the violation of P.D. No. 381 
in relation to Section 4-B of P.D. No. 189, <em>as amended</em>, not Section 4-b of P.D. No. 189 <em>before it was amended</em>.
  This means that “Upon conviction of a court of competent jurisdiction”
 the "penalty of imprisonment of not less than two (2) years nor more 
than five (5) years or a fine of not less than two thousand pesos nor 
more than five thousand pesos, or both, at the discretion of the court' 
shall be imposed.
</p><p>
In dismissing the case, the respondent court relied on rules of statutory construction and held that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is basic that if the writing is plain, certain and free from 
ambiguity, a bare reading suffices and interpretation is unnecessary or 
stated conversely, if the writing is ambiguous, or its meaning 
uncertain, interpretation is required in order to ascertain what the 
writer meant.  But interpretation may be required and justified by 
various factors.  Besides the doubt created by doubtful meaning of words
 used do not express the <em>Prosecutor's Information</em> intent 
perfectly, in which case interpretation is needed.  Such is the case at 
bar, the Court honestly believe that the language used exceeds or falls 
short of expressing the meaning intended."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
An examination of the information shows on its face that it does not 
suffer from any material or substantial defect or any so-called 
ambiguity or double meaning as to warrant the dismissal of the case.  
Contrary to the respondents' claim, the information appears sufficiently
 explicit. It does not suffer from the obscurity, unintelligibility, or 
vagueness alleged by the respondents.  Respondent Española created 
ambiguity where there was none.  Resort to statutory construction or 
interpretation was, therefore, unnecessary.
</p><p>
Assuming the information to have been vague and ambiguous, alternative 
courses of action could have been taken.  Respondent Española could have
 filed a motion for a bill of particulars if he did not feel like 
researching into a Presidential Decree with a Section 4-b and a Section 
4-B.  A bill of particulars while provided for under Section 6 of Rule 
116 is not a popular procedure among lawyers for the accused in criminal
 cases.  For one thing, it may invite an amended information which is 
not only clearer but may also be stronger and more incriminating.  
However, it would have clarified and corrected at an early stage the 
kind of doubt which the accused in this particular case alleged to have 
entertained.  Section 6 of Rule 116 provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    SEC. 6. <em>Bill of Particulars.</em> - Defendant may, at the time 
of or before arraignment, move for or demand a more definite statement 
or a bill of particulars of any matter which is not averred with 
sufficient definiteness or particularity to enable him properly to plead
 or prepare for trial.  The motion shall point out the defects 
complained of and the details desired.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The more appropriate procedure under the circumstances would have been 
an order from the court directing the Fiscal to amend the information 
because the defect, if there ever was one, was curable by the simplest 
of amendments or clarifications.  There was no basis to grant the motion
 to quash and dismiss the case.
</p><p>
This Court stated in <em>People v. Plaza</em> (117 Phil. 627), where we 
found that the real defect of the information was not that the facts 
alleged therein did not constitute a punishable offense but that its 
allegations were vague, that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "But even assuming that the lower court was right in holding that 
the facts alleged in the information do not constitute a punishable 
offense, as far as defendant Plaza was concerned, the case should not 
have been dismissed with respect to him.  Instead, pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 7, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, the lower court
 should have given the prosecution an opportunity to amend the 
information.  That under the provisions of said rule the trial court may
 order the filing of another information or simply the amendment of the 
one already filed is clearly in accordance with the settled rule in this
 jurisdiction (U.S. v. Muyo, 2 Phil. 177; People v. Tan, 48 Phil. 877, 
880)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the ruling of this Court was not followed.  Instead, after 
respondent Española filed a motion to quash to which the Fiscal together
 with the complainant Philippine Tourism Authority interposed an 
opposition, the same was granted.  To make matters worse, the case had 
to be brought to this Court on certiorari.  The filing of this petition 
and the resultant unnecessary addition to the heavy docket of this Court
 could have been avoided by the simple expedient of ordering the filing 
of an amended information.
</p><p>
Respondent Española contends that the phrase "as amended" found in the 
information cannot be the subject of guessing by the accused.  He argues
 that -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x the purpose of the designation of the offense <em>'is to 
secure a clear specification of the offense charged.  And, inasmuch as 
in criminal cases, not only the liberty but even the life of the 
defendants may be at stake, it is always wise and proper that they 
should be fully apprised of the charges against them, and thus avoid any
 and all possible surprise, which might be detrimental to their rights 
and interests</em>.' (People v. Abad Santos, 76 Phil. 744) It would be 
unwise to change the battleground in criminal cases from issues to 
guesses and from facts to fancy."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The respondent was not caught in a speculative guessing game.  He knew 
very well or should have known what law amended P.D. No. 189.  And even 
if the respondent was sincerely confused at the start, he was properly 
apprised of the present status and applicable provision of the decree 
when the Fiscal and the complainant Philippine Tourism Authority filed 
their separate oppositions to the motion to quash.  The respondent court
 quoted P.D. No. 259, the amendatory decree in its order.  The correct 
action to take on the motion to quash was obvious.
</p><p>
We have held that an error which specifies the wrong provision of 
applicable law does not necessarily vitiate the information (People v. 
Arnault, 92 Phil. 252).  A fortiori should an imagined ambiguity not 
vitiate the information.  For it is a well-settled rule that the real 
nature of the crime charged in an information or complaint is determined
 not by the title of the complaint, nor by the specification of the 
provision of law alleged to have been violated, but by the facts alleged
 in the complaint or information (People v. Oliveria, 67 Phil. 427).
</p><p>
What is important is not the designation of the offense charged in the 
caption of the information but the facts alleged therein (People V. 
Agito, 103 Phil. 526).  The designation by name of the crime in the 
caption of the information constitutes a conclusion of law on the part 
of the fiscal.  It is not necessarily essential, for the protection of 
the substantial rights of the accused or for the effective preparation 
of his defense, that he be informed of the technical name of the crime 
of which he stands charged (People v. Cosare, 95 Phil. 656).
</p><p>
The respondent court further erred in holding that P.D. No. 381 in 
relation to Section 4-B of P.D. No. 189, as amended is not prohibitive 
but rather is a permissive and preceptive provision of law.  A perusal 
of the decrees involved shows the contrary.  Section 1 of P.D. No. 381 
is worded in the negative, i.e., ". . . no development project for 
tourism purposes. . . ". Moreover, it uses the word "shall" instead of 
"may" evincing the mandatory nature of the provision itself.  In 
addition, it contains a "no-exemption clause", i.e., "any provision of 
existing laws, decrees or rules to the contrary notwithstanding..." Most
 important, the decree carries a penalty of imprisonment or fine or both
 for a violation of its provisions.  It would be incongruous for 
permissive provision of law to be sanctioned by stiff criminal 
penalties.  When all these are combined, the effect is to clearly 
express the prohibitive intent of the law.
</p><p>
Respondent Española adamantly insists that he has not violated P.D. No. 
381 since the Philippine Tourism Authority gave due course to his 
application.  This is a matter of defense on the part of the accused and
 should be properly ventilated during the full-dressed trial on the 
merits of the case below.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is given due course.  The questioned order of 
the respondent court is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  The appropriate 
Regional Trial Court is directed to proceed with the arraignment of the 
private respondent and, thereafter, to proceed with the trial of the 
case.  No costs.

SO ORDERED.
