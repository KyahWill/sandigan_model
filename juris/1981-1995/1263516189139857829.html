NLRC, 190 SCRA 347; Lantion<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> NLRC, 181 SCRA 513).<br><br>In the case at bench, the policy of awarding illegally dismissed employees' backwages limited to three (3) years, without qualification or deduction, otherwise known as the Mercury Drug Rule,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> would thus prevail.<br><br>We find untenable private respondents' contention that since the decision of the Labor Arbiter has become final and executory and was in fact partially executed, it can no longer be disturbed or modified.&nbsp; We adhere to our ruling in <i>Sealand Service, Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> thus:<br><br>We have constantly adopted the policy of awarding backwages to illegally dismissed employees to three years without qualification or deduction.&nbsp; This policy applies even to final decisions awarding backwages in excess of three years.<br><br>As we ruled in <i>Mansalay Catholic High School vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Even if the decision of the NLRC that was being enforced through execution has become final and executory, the same should be interpreted and implemented in that in cases of illegal dismissal, the backwages that the employee should be entitled to should be for a period of not exceeding three (3) years.&nbsp; The excuse of the NLRC that the decision has become final and executory and cannot be modified is puerile.&nbsp; Such decision is subject to this rule.&nbsp; Any decision or order granting backwages in excess of three (3) years is null and void as to the excess a departure therefrom constitutes a grave abuse of discretion.</blockquote><br>Hence, in the case at bar, the open-ended duration prescribed in the decision sought to be enforced by the questioned resolution should be subject to said limitation and the award of backwages should, therefore, be limited to three (3) years without qualification or deduction.&nbsp; The computation of the award made by the labor arbiter in excess of this limit is null and void and the writ of execution issued pursuant thereto should be set aside.<br><br>Likewise, we find no justification for the award of attorney's fees.&nbsp; The decision of the Labor Arbiter dated 16 August 1989, on which the writs of execution dated 29 October 1991 and 22 October 1992 of the labor arbiter were based, was limited to the reinstatement of private respondents and payment of their backwages.&nbsp; Attorney's fees were not awarded.&nbsp; Private respondents contended that they have "successfully appealed the award of attorney's fees"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> through the urgent motion to correct/modify decision of 16 August 1989 which they filed on 14 September 1989. However, the record is bereft of any evidence to show that their motion was granted or particularly, that attorney's fees were granted to them.&nbsp; It is a long standing rule that:<br><br>When the writ of execution is not in harmony with and exceeds the judgment which gives it life, the writ has <i>pro tanto</i> no validity..."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><sup></sup><br><br>The execution of judgment must conform to that which is ordained and decreed in the dispositive portion of the decision.&nbsp; Where the writ runs counter to, differs from or exceeds the specific provisions in the judgment the same is issued without or in excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The NLRC is vested with authority to look into the correctness of the execution of the decision and to consider supervening events that may affect such execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In its assailed decision, the NLRC declared that:<br><br><blockquote>After an examination of the subject computation, We cannot help but declare a finding of patent departure from applicable jurisprudence on the computation of backwages by complainants and the Labor Arbiter <i>a quo</i> considering that the computation covers a period of four years and six months more or less and it included items not covered by the term backwages as well as an award of 10% attorney's fees which was not included in the Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated 16 August 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>Likewise, complainants' backwages should not exceed the three (3) year period and this applies even to final and executory judgment...<br><br><center><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br><br>As regards the claim of respondents that the Writ of Execution included benefits not awarded in the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated August 16, 1989, the Supreme Court in a number of cases ruled as follows:<br><br>Where the execution is not in harmony with the exceeds the judgment that gives it life, the writ has no authority. (Christian Literature Crusade <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. NLRC, 171 SCRA 712).<br><br>Execution must conform with the dispositive portion of the decision. (Paylago vs. Nicolas, 189 SCRA 722).<br><br><center><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br><br>Despite such pronouncements, however, the NLRC failed to rectify the writ of execution previously issued by the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; The NLRC should have proceeded to modify or make a recomputation of the monetary award to conform with its ruling as afore-quoted.&nbsp; Clearly, the NLRC has been remiss in its duty.</blockquote><br>We cannot uphold the NLRC's decision not to disturb the computation of backwages awarded to private respondents on the basis of petitioner's voluntary admission of liability. The NLRC opined:<br><br>On the other hand, respondent submitted their own computation of the amount due herein complainants wherein they admitted their liabilities to them in the amount of P443,733.98 for Teresita Lejano and P300,952.39 representing three (3) years backwages, 13th month pay, economic or educational assistance, clothing allowance, transportation allowance, vacation leave, cash allowance/incentive pay and retrenchment package.&nbsp; Although the said computation (pp. 412-415, Records) includes benefits not covered by the term wages as defined in the afore-quoted decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Paramount Vinyl Products vs. NLRC, Ibid.) since the same is voluntarily admitted by respondents to be due complainants, we will no longer disturb the same, except as to the computation on separation pay, which we will discuss in the latter part of this decision. (Underscoring ours.)<br><br>Now, as to the questioned Order of the Labor Arbiter a quo dated 22 October 1992, allowing an additional and uninterrupted backwages/monetary benefits to complainants-appellees, We find the same to be contrary to the jurisprudence aforequoted and should be set aside.<br><br>The issue of reinstatement in the instant case has become moot and academic considering the respondent's dissolution on 30 June 1992.&nbsp; Thus, We find the award of separation pay proper in lieu of actual reinstatement of complainants.&nbsp; In the cases of Asphalt &amp; Cement Pavers, Inc. vs. Vicente Leogardo, Jr., and Valentin Torillo vs. Vicente Leogardo, Jr., et al., G.R. No. 77205, the Supreme Court held that `an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement to his previous position without loss of seniority rights and backwages for a period of three (3) years without qualification and deduction (Mercury Drug Rule).&nbsp; If reinstatement is no<i> </i>longer feasible, the employer may be ordered to pay in addition to backwages, separation pay as provided by law.'<br><br>We find the amount of P123,578.00 (P 7,604.80 x 1.25 x 13 years) due to complainant Teresita Lejano, as her separation pay, while the amount of P76,518.00 (P4,708.80 x 1.25 x 13 years) due to complainant Rodolfo Angeles as his separation pay. (Annex `2', Retrenchment Program of BDC Employees, pp. 408-410, Records).<br><br>However, there is no need to order respondent BDC to pay complainants their aforestated separation pay considering that the aforestated amounts have already been covered in the total amount of P1,174,814.28 received by them as above-discussed. (Underscoring ours)<br><br>At most, the NLRC could have simply taken such admission in consideration in recomputing the monetary award due to private respondents.&nbsp; There should be harmony in all aspects of the decision.&nbsp; To rule otherwise would be tantamount to injustice.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned decision of the NLRC is AFFIRMED subject to the modification that:<br><br>1)&nbsp; the backwages awarded should be limited to three (3) years only, without qualification or deduction and the excess, if any, shall be refunded to petitioner; and<br><br>2)&nbsp; petitioner is hereby ordered to pay separation pay in the amount of P123,578.00 for private respondent Teresita Lejano and P76,518.00 for private respondent Rodolfo Angeles, in lieu of reinstatement due to the dissolution of petitioner corporation on 30 June 1992.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Padilla, (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Bellosillo,</i> and <i>Hermosisima, Jr., JJ., </i>concur. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at<i> </i>56-57.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 113.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 113-114, 119-120.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 63.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 115.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 125.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 121<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 16-17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Art. 279 of the Labor Code as amended by R.A.
