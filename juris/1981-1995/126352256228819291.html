The success of the challenge posed in this suit for declaratory relief or prohibition proceeding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  on the validity of Section 1 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 135 depends upon a
 showing of its constitutional infirmity.  The assailed provision 
further amends Section 21 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977,
 which provides for rates of tax on citizens or resi­dents on (a) 
taxable compensation income, (b) taxable net income, (c) royalties, 
prizes, and other winnings, (d) interest from bank deposits and yield or
 any other monetary benefit from deposit substitutes and from trust fund
 and similar arrangements, (e) dividends and share of individual partner
 in the net profits of taxable partnership, (f) adjusted gross income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Petitioner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  as taxpayer alleges that by virtue thereof, "he would be unduly 
discriminated against by the impo­sition of higher rates of tax upon his
 income arising from the exercise of his profession <em>vis-a-vis</em> those which are imposed upon fixed income or salaried individual taxpayers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  He characterizes the above section as arbitrary amounting to class legislation, oppressive and capricious in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  For petitioner, therefore, there is a transgression of both the equal protection and due process clauses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  of the Constitution as well as of the rule requiring uniformity in taxation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
<p>
The Court, in a resolution of January 26, 1982, required respondents to 
file an answer within 10 days from notice.  Such an answer, after two 
extensions were granted the Office of the Solicitor General, was filed 
on May 28, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  The facts
 as alleged were admitted but not the allegations which to their mind 
are "mere arguments, opinions or conclusions on the part of the 
petitioner, the truth [for them] being those stated [in their] Special 
and Affirmative Defenses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
 The answer then affirmed:  "Batas Pambansa Blg. 135 is a valid exercise
 of the State's power to tax.  The authorities and cases cited, while 
correctly quoted or paraphrased, do not support petitioner's stand."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  The prayer is for the dis­missal of the petition for lack of merit.
</p><p>
This Court finds such a plea more than justified.  The petition must be dismissed.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  It is manifest that the field of state activity has assumed a 
much wider scope.  The reason was so clearly set forth by retired Chief 
Justice Makalintal thus: "The areas which used to be left to private 
enterprise and initiative and which the government was called upon to 
enter optionally, and only 'because it was better equipped to administer
 for the public welfare than is any private individual or group of 
individuals,' continue to lose their well-defined boundaries and to be 
absorbed within activities that the government must undertake in its 
sovereign capacity if it is to meet the increasing social challenges of 
the times."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Hence the 
need for more revenues.  The power to tax, an inherent prerogative, has 
to be availed of to assure the performance of vital state functions.  It
 is the source of the bulk of public funds.  To paraphrase a recent 
decision, taxes being the lifeblood of the government, their prompt and 
certain availability is of the essence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 2.  The power to tax moreover, to borrow from Justice Malcolm, "is
 an attribute of sovereignty.  It is the strongest of all the powers of 
government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It is, of 
course, to be admitted that for all its plenitude, the power to tax is 
not unconfined.  There are restrictions.  The Constitution sets forth 
such limits.  Adversely affecting as it does property rights, both the 
due process and equal protection clauses may properly be invoked, as 
petitioner does, to invalidate in appropriate cases a revenue measure.  
If it were otherwise, there would be truth to the 1803 dictum of Chief 
Justice Marshall that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  In a separate opinion in Graves v. New York,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 Justice Frankfurter, after referring to it as an "unfortunate remark," 
characterized it as "a flourish of rhetoric [attributable to] the 
intel­lectual fashion of the times [allowing] a free use of absolutes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 This is merely to emphasize that it is not and there cannot be such a 
constitutional mandate.  Justice Frankfurter could rightfully conclude: 
"The web of unreality spun from Marshall's famous dictum was brushed 
away by one stroke of Mr. Justice Holmes's pen:  'The power to tax is 
not the power to destroy while this Court sits.' "<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  So it is in the Philippines.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  This Court then is left with no choice.  The Constitution as the
 fundamental law overrides any legislative or executive act that runs 
counter to it.  In any case therefore where it can be demonstrated that 
the challenged statutory provision - as petitioner here alleges - fails 
to abide by its command, then this Court must so declare and adjudge it 
null.  The inquiry thus is centered on the question of whether the 
imposition of a higher tax rate on taxable net income derived from 
business or profession than on compensation is constitutionally infirm.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.  The difficulty confronting petitioner is thus apparent.  He 
alleges arbitrariness.  A mere allegation, as here, does not suffice.  
There must be a factual foundation of such unconstitutional taint.  
Considering that petitioner here would condemn such a provision as void 
on its face, he has not made out a case.  This is merely to adhere to 
the authoritative doctrine that where the due process and equal 
protection clauses are invoked, considering that they are not fixed 
rules but rather broad standards, there is a need for proof of such 
persuasive character as would lead to such a conclusion.  Absent such a 
showing, the presumption of validity must prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    5.  It is undoubted that the due process clause may be invoked where
 a taxing statute is so arbitrary that it finds no support in the 
Constitution.  An obvious example is where it can be shown to amount to 
the confiscation of property.  That would be a clear abuse of power.  It
 then becomes the duty of this Court to say that such an arbitrary act 
amounted to the exercise of an authority not conferred.  That properly 
calls for the application of the Holmes dictum.  It has also been held 
that where the assailed tax measure is beyond the jurisdiction of the 
state, or is not for a public purpose, or, in case of a retroactive 
statute is so harsh and unreasonable, it is subject to attack on due 
process grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 6.  Now for equal protection.  The applicable standard to avoid 
the charge that there is a denial of this constitutional mandate whether
 the assailed act is in the exercise of the police power or the power of
 eminent domain is to demonstrate "that the governmental act assailed, 
far from being inspired by the attainment of the common weal was 
prompted by the spirit of hostility, or at the very least, 
discrimination that finds no support in reason.  It suffices then that 
the laws operate equally and uniformly on all persons under similar 
circumstances or that all persons must be treated in the same manner, 
the conditions not being different, both in the privileges conferred and
 the liabilities-imposed.  Favoritism and undue preference cannot be 
allowed.  For the principle is that equal protection and security shall 
be given to every person under circumstances, which if not identical are
 analogous.  If law be looked upon in terms of burden or charges, those 
that fall within a class should be treated in the same fashion, whatever
 restrictions cast on some in the group equally binding on the rest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 That same formulation applies as well to taxation measures.  The equal 
protection clause is of course, inspired by the noble concept of 
approximating the ideal of the laws's benefits being available to all 
and the affairs of men being governed by that serene and impartial 
uniformity, which is of the very essence of the idea of law.  There is, 
however, wisdom, as well as realism, in these words of Justice 
Frank-further: "The equality at which the 'equal protection' clause the 
former deals with an eminent domain proceeding and the latter with a 
suit contesting the validity of a police power measure aims is not a 
disembodied equality.  The Fourteenth Amendment enjoins 'the equal 
protection of the laws,' and laws are not abstract propositions.  They 
do not relate to abstract units A, B and C, but are expressions of 
policy arising out of specific difficulties, addressed to the attainment
 of specific ends by the use of specific remedies.  The Constitution 
does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be 
treated in law as though they were the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
  Hence the constant reiteration of the view that classification if 
rational in character is allowable.  As a matter of fact, in a leading 
case of Lutz v. Araneta,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 
this Court, through Justice J.B.L. Reyes, went so far as to hold "at any
 rate, it is inherent in the power to tax that a state be free to select
 the subjects of taxation, and it has been repeatedly held that 
'inequalities which result from a singling out of one particular class 
for taxation, or exemption infringe no constitutional limitation.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 7.  Petitioner likewise invoked the kindred concept of uniformity.
  According to the Constitution: "The rule of taxation shall be uniform 
and equitable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  This requirement is met according to Justice Laurel in Philippine Trust Company v. Yatco,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> decided in 1940, when the tax "operates with the same force and effect in every place where the subject may be found."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 He likewise added: "The rule of uniformity does not call for perfect 
uniformity or perfect equality, because this is hardly attainable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 The problem of classification did not present itself in that case.  It 
did not arise until nine years later, when the Supreme Court held: 
"Equality and uniformity in taxation means that all taxable articles or 
kinds of property of the same class shall be taxed at the same rate.  
The taxing power has the authority to make reasonable and natural 
classifications for purposes of taxation, * * *.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 As clarified by Justice Tuason, where " the differentiation" complained
 of "conforms to the practical dictates of justice and equity" it "is 
not discriminatory within the meaning of this clause and is therefore 
uniform."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> There is quite a
 similarity then to the standard of equal protection for all that is 
required is that the tax "applies equally to all persons, firms and 
corporations placed in similar situation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    8.  Further on this point.  Apparently, what misled petitioner is 
his failure to take into consideration the distinction between a tax 
rate and a tax base.  There is no legal objection to a broader tax base 
or taxable income by eliminating all deductible items and at the same 
time reducing the applicable tax rate.  Taxpayers may be classified into
 different categories.  To repeat, it is enough that the classification 
must rest upon substantial distinctions that make real differences.  In 
the case of the gross income taxation embodied in Batas Pambansa Blg. 
135, the discernible basis of classification is the susceptibility of 
the income to the application of generalized rules removing all 
deductible items for all taxpayers within the class and fixing a set of 
reduced tax rates to be applied to all of them.  Taxpayers who are 
recipients of compensation income are set apart as a class.  As there is
 practically no overhead expense, these taxpayers are not entitled to 
make deductions for income tax, purposes because they are in the same 
situation more or less.  On the other hand, in the case of professionals
 in the practice of their calling and businessmen, there is no 
uniformity in the costs or expenses necessary to produce their income.  
It would not be just then to disregard the disparities by giving all of 
them zero deduction and indiscriminately impose on all alike the same 
tax rates on the basis of gross income.  There is ample justification 
then for the Batasang Pambansa to adopt the gross system of income 
taxation to compensation income, while continuing the system of net 
income taxation as regards professional and business income.
  </p>
  <p>
    9.  Nothing can be clearer, therefore, than that the petition is 
without merit, considering the (1) lack of factual foundation to show 
the arbitrary character of the assailed provision;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
  (2) the force of controlling doctrines on due process, equal 
protection, and uniformity in taxation and (3) the reasonableness of the
 distinction between compensation and taxable net income of 
professionals and businessmen -- certainly not a suspect classification.

<p>This is a frivolous suit. While the tax <em>rates</em> for compensation income are lower than those for net income such circumstance does not necessarily result in lower tax <em>payments</em>
 for those receiving compensation income. In fact, the reverse will most
 likely be the case; those who file returns on the basis of net income
