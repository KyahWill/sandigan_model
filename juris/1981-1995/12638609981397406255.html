<p class="BODY">In a complaint (pp. 1-8, Record on Appeal) dated May 30, 1967,
plaintiffs Antonio Solis and Angela Solis <span class="SpellE">Calimlim</span>
alleged that they are co-owners of a parcel of residential land situated at
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bued</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Calasiao</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

that this parcel of land was inherited from their parents, Simeon Solis and <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span> <span class="SpellE">Bauzon</span>; that in 1939,
they allowed defendants Jose Solis and his wife <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dioquino</span> to construct a house on the eastern portion
of plaintiffs' parcel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>land

should vacate the premises as soon as <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">their
financial conditions </span>would permit them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 1965, plaintiffs demanded that the defendants vacate the premises but
the latter refused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer (pp. 8-10, Record on Appeal) of defendants raised as
affirmative defense the fact of their ownership of the property in question
having acquired the same by way of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">donacion</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>nuptias</u></span> </span>from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

since 1931, they were in possession of said property openly, continuously and
adversely, to the exclusion of all others, and in the concept of owners and
that since 1931 they have paid the taxes due on the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1968</st1:date>,
plaintiffs filed a Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory

1933.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since then, they have exercised
various acts of dominion over the disputed property such as constructing their
house thereon enjoying its fruits to the exclusion of all others and paying
realty taxes corresponding to the disputed one-half portion of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the plaintiffs acknowledge this fact by
their own evidence that they, for their own part, also paid half of the realty
taxes for the western portion of the land (Exhibits C, C-1 to C-6; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., June 25, 1969, p. 39).</blockquote>

property (Exhibits C, C-1 to C-6; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., June 25,
1969, p. 39).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is strongly
indicative of the fact that the defendants are the owners of the eastern half
of the land over which they, in turn, paid the corresponding half of the realty
taxes from 1934 (Exhibits 2, 2-A to 2-S).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further, the circumstance that neither the appellants nor their donors
have declared the disputed portion in their names prior to 1967 is not sufficient
to overcome the undisputed possession for more than 30 years of the property in
question by the appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Vigor
vs. Director of Lands, <span class="GramE">CA 57 O.G. 5888</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also contend that since no competent proof was

<p class="BODY">This contention of petitioners is not meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state that even a void donation

was a mode of transferring ownership, still something is wrong because the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Finally, petitioners
assail respondent appellate court's holding that their cause of action had </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">prescribed, overlooking the </span>importance

said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">that </span>the record shows that
Tomas Solis (private respondent's predecessor) was already in possession of the
eastern portion in question before 1927 (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., June
25, 1969, pp. 41, 42, 47; p. 2, CA decision).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, no evidence was presented to show that Tomas Solis' possession
thereof was adverse, exclusive or in the concept of an owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the appellate court concluded that
private respondents possession have been actual, adverse, continuous, open,
public, notorious, peaceful and uninterrupted only in 1933, when they took
possession of the property by virtue of the <span class="SpellE"><u>donacion</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court, therefore, found and <span class="GramE">We</span> agree that it was in 1933 when petitioners' cause of
action accrued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if we were to admit, as contended by petitioners, that their
cause of action accrued only in 1941 (p. 3 of Reply; p. 148, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), the first time that private respondents can
be considered as having <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">repudiated </span>petitioners'
ownership of the premises by paying the tax on the property in the name of
respondent Jose Solis, the same conclusion would be obtained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lapse of more than twenty (20) years of
adverse possession by private respondents is sufficient to confer ownership on
them of the disputed portion under the Old Civil Code which requires only ten
(10) years of adverse possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Article 41 of the Old Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 41.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Title to land by prescription<span class="GramE">.-</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Ten years of </span>adverse

uninterruptedly, continuously <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">for ten

occupancy may have commenced or continued, shall vest in every actual possessor
of such land a full complete title, saving to the person under disabilities the
rights, secured by the next Section."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although petitioners' action for quieting of title was filed in
May 30, 1967 when the New Civil Code was already in effect, Article 1116 of the
New Civil Code provides that "prescription already running before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code (August 30, 1950) shall be
governed by laws previously in force; x <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

41 of the Old Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, whatever claim petitioners had over the disputed
property had prescribed in view of private respondents' open, actual, peaceful,
continuous and adverse possession of the same property for more than thirty
years or at the least, for more than twenty (20) years.</p>
