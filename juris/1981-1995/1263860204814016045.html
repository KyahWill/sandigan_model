it was only on August 20, 1984 that they were reinstated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was opposed by <span class="SpellE">Supercars</span>
alleging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that private

view of the fact that the orders dated August 1, 1983 and April 6, 1984 issued
by the Minister of Labor and Employment limit their right to reinstatement
only; that there was not even a writ of execution when the private respondents
were reinstated to their former positions; and that to grant <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> would amount to a modification of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> orders.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

filing of said Motion for Reconsideration did not have the effect of suspending
the judgment's immediate <span class="SpellE">executoriness</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason behind this is that the period

was to reinstate individual complainants within the ten-day period as directed
in the judgment with the reservation that should their prayer in their Motion

they should be allowed to dismiss <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">them

justice to individual complainants through the payment to them of their

of said violation of respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
