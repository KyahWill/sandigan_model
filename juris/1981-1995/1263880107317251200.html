<p class="BODY">The factual background of this <span style="">case </span>as found by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of
Appeals is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 21, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Hadd</span> Construction
and Trading Corpora­tion (HCTC for brevity) purchased on installment basis a
Toyota Corolla Hardtop, 2<span style="">-D</span>oor,
1978 Model with Engine No. 3K-7515608, <span style="">Serial
</span>No. <span style="">KE 35-9</span>15409, Plate
No. B-YE-290 from Cressida Sales Corporation (Cressida <span style="">for </span>brevity), HCTC, represented by peti­tioner Reynaldo C. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>, Jr. as<span style=""> </span>president,
executed a promissory note in favor of Cressida, in the amount of P49,120,20,
payable at the rate of P1,364.45 a month for thirty six (36) months beginning
September 25,1978 and every 25th day of the month thereafter until full
payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said promissory note, HCTC
agreed to a waiver of formal demand and presentment <span style="">as </span>well as notices of protest and dishonor, <span style="">among others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> </span>signed the
promissory note a second time <span style="">as </span><span style="">co-maker of </span>HCTC.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
A chattel mortgage on the motor vehicle was also executed by HCTC in favor of
Cressida.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1978</st1:date>,
Cressida executed a deed of assignment of the promissory note with warranty of
soundness in favor of <span class="SpellE">Jardine</span>-Manila Finance, Inc.
for and in consideration of P30<span class="GramE">,985.54</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was executed with <span class="SpellE">HCTC's</span>
conformity, represented again by petitioner as its president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
likewise signed this deed of assignment as co-maker.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For failure of HCTC to pay the monthly amortization as stipulated
in the promissory note, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Jardine</span>-Manila
Finance, Inc. filed on May 22, 1979 an action for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
and damages with the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
Branch CXL, docketed as Civil Case No. 2096, praying for the seizure and
delivery of the questioned motor vehicle to private respondent, with
alternative prayer, that in the event the normal delivery of the motor vehicle
cannot be effected, judgment be rendered ordering HCTC to pay P41,011.34 with
14% interest per annum from the date the obligation became due and demandable
until fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> petitioner Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>,
Jr. as party-defendant on the contention that he signed the documents as
co-maker.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After an answer with <span style="">compulsory
</span>counterclaim was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="11">November
 7, 1981</st1:date> by herein petitioner as defendant therein, the case was
thereafter set for pre-trial conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 14, 1983, private respondent informed the <span style="">trial court </span>that it was waiving the
recovery of the motor vehicle and chose to pursue instead its alternative
prayer considering that since the filing of the complaint, it has not been able
to recover said <span style="">motor </span>vehicle,
and that even if recovered, its current value would not allegedly be
commensurate to the amount of P41<span class="GramE">,011.34</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, private respondent moved to dismiss the case
against HCTC without prejudice on the ground that summons could not be served
on said defendant corporation since it was no longer holding office at its
given address and its present ad­<span style="">dress </span>could
not be ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was
granted by the trial court on October 3, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the trial court rendered the assailed decision
against petitioner who seasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="8">August
 5, 1987</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision affirming
that of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence the present recourse of petitioner.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">To support his prayer for reversal of the appellate court's
decision, petitioner argues that he signed the promissory note and deed of
chattel mortgage in his official capacity as president of HCTC only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never intended to sign these documents as
co-maker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, petitioner in his
Memorandum raises the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WAS</span> PRIVATE RESPONDENT CORRECT IN ITS
CONTENTION THAT PETITIONER WAS A CO-MAKER OF HCTC IN THE EXECUTION OF THE
PROMISSORY NOTE AND DEED OF CHATTEL MORTGAGE IN QUESTION?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WAS</span> THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECT IN
ITS INTERPRETATION OF SUBJECT PROMISSORY NOTE AND DEED OF CHATTEL MORTGAGE IN
FAVOR OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT AND AGAINST PETITIONER?"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
vehemently denies any liability as co-maker of HCTC on the ground that the body
of documents in question, namely, the promissory note and deed of chattel
mortgage, indicates that the contract was between HCTC and Cressida only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, petitioner cites the testimony
of Mr. George <span class="SpellE">Caruncho</span>, the sales agent of Cressida,
who stated that petitioner was asked to sign these documents in his official
capacity as president of HCTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the above contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
cannot plead that he signed these documents in his official capacity only as
president of HCTC and not as co-maker with HCTC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The documents in question, including the deed
of assignment which contains petitioner's signature as co-maker, whose
genuineness and due execution were admitted by petitioner, clearly indicate
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by respondent Court
<span style="">of </span>Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"The promissory note (Exhibit
"A") clearly shows on its face that the appellant signed the same in
his capacity as President of the <span class="SpellE">Hadd</span> Construction
&amp; Trading <span style="">Corp. </span>and again as
co-maker in his private capacity (Exhibits "A-2" &amp;
"A-3").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also signed
the Deed of Chattel Mortgage and the Affidavit of Good Faith four (4) times;
twice as President and twice as co-maker (Exhibit "B").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the appellant lastly signed his
conformity to the Deed of Assignment (Exhibit "C") as president and
again as co-maker."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">From the above facts, petitioner, by
signing these documents several times <span style="">as
</span>co-maker, is presumed to be aware of the consequences of his
actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> is of age and a businessman, holding the highest
position in <span class="SpellE">Hadd</span> Construction Trading Corporation, he
is presumed to have acted with due care, and to have signed the documents in
question with full knowledge of its contents as well as the attendant
obligations and responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
aptly observed by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> defendant <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> is presumed to have intended the ordinary
consequences of his voluntary act and taken ordinary care of his concerns.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When defendant signed eight times on three
documents, and always as president and as co-maker, it is presumed that he had
exercised care in verifying his involvement in the transaction, considering his
age, business life, intelligence and the fact that he occupied the highest
office in the corporation."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, there is no evidence of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner on cross-examination testified as
follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the left <span class="SpellE">handmargin</span>
of the promisso­ry note there appears a signature over the name Reynaldo C. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> Jr., President, <span class="SpellE">Hadd</span>
Construction and Trading Corp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will you
kindly tell us if this is your signature?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also, at the right hand margin of
the promissory note there appears a signature above the typewritten name
Reynaldo C. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>, Jr., <span style="">co-maker, is </span>this your signature?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, <span style="">sir, that </span>is<span style=""> </span>my
signature."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> did </span>not question and in fact admit­ted the
genuineness <span style="">and due </span>execution of
these documents, includ­ing the genuineness of his signatures, then these
documents must be given legal effects.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">testimony of the
sales agent, </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Caruncho</span>, can not change the <span style="">legal effect </span>of these documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting that he <span style="">told </span>petitioner to sign these documents in his official capacity
<span style="">as president of HCTC, </span>the mere <span style="">fact </span>that petitioner also signed
voluntarily as co-maker proves his participation in <span style="">the </span>transactions as a co-maker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Caruncho</span> testified that when
petitioner signed these documents, all the type-written words already appeared
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of interpretation of contracts, it is basic and
fundamental that if the terms of the <span style="">contract
are clear, the </span>literal meaning of the stipulation shall control.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The intention of the parties <span style="">to a </span>contract
must be determined from the contract itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> signed several times
on these documents as president of HCTC and as co-maker, there is no other
interpretation but to conclusively presume that he bound himself also as
co-maker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He can not therefore renege on
the obligations and liabilities <span style="">attached
</span>to a co-maker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the terms of
a contract are clear and do not leave room for doubt as to the intention of the
contracting parties, it is not necessary to interpret the same, the literal
meaning of its clauses should be followed.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The promissory note clearly stipulates a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
obligation as shown by the following clause "For <span style="">value received <u>I/We</u> <u>jointly</u> <u>and</u> </span><u>severally</u>
<span style="">promised to pay Cressida Motor Sales
Corp. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Signed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hadd</span> Construction
&amp; Trading Corporation by Reynaldo C. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>,
Jr., President and Reynaldo C. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>, Jr.,
Co-maker".</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In </span>the case of <span class="SpellE">Parot</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Gemora</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court had occasion to state:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Where a promissory note is signed by
two or more persons promising to pay the amount of the said note <span class="SpellE">juntos</span> o <span class="SpellE">separadamente</span>, such <span class="SpellE">comakers</span> are individually liable for the payment of the
full amount of the obligation of such contract."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> <span style="">is </span><span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
<span style="">liable </span>to pay the full amount of
the obligation <span style="">as </span>stipulated in
the <span style="">promissory </span>note to which
private respondent <span style="">is entitled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the award of P81<span class="GramE">,325.00</span> based
or the Statement of Account as of December 10, 1983,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
prepared by private respondent includes other charges aside from the principal
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These charges have not been
satisfactorily proved during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, a careful examination of the records of the case failed to
support these charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records <span class="GramE">are bereft</span> of any evidence to show how these charges were
computed nor is there an adequate showing that private respondent is entitled
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere mention of the
outstanding obligation of petitioner in the amount of P81,747.05 as of December
10, 1985 in the testimony of Alfonso Flores, private respondent's manager for
collection,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
is not sufficient without proof presented before the court of the expenses and
other charges imputed to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in the interest of justice and equity, petitioner should be liable
only for the outstanding balance based on the promissory note in the amount of
P40<span class="GramE">,769.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is computed by deducting the total payments equivalent to four 4)
monthly installments made by HCTC in the amount of P8<span class="GramE">,351.20</span>
from the principal amount of the promissory note of P49,120.20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, this amount of P40<span class="GramE">,769.00</span> shall earn interest at the rate of 14% per annum to
be computed from March 10, 1979 when the total amount of the principal
obligation became due and demandable<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
until actual payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award of 10%
