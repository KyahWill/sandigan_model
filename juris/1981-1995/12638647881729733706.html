dated 14 January 1978 rendered by Branch 31 of the then Court of First Instance
of Manila, Sixth Judicial District, in Civil Case No. 97581 (entitled "New
Zealand Insurance Co. Ltd., plaintiff, versus Maritime Company of the
Philippines, E. Razon Inc., E.B. Marcha Transport Co., Inc. and Executive
Brokerage Corp., defendants").</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are stated in the decision of the trial
court:</p>

<blockquote>"The New Zealand Insurance Co., Ltd. ["New Zealand,"
petitioner herein] instituted this action to recover from defendants Maritime
Company of the Philippines and E. Razon Inc. ["Razon," respondent
herein], the sum of P19,644.05 it paid to the consignee for the loss by
spillage and contamination of imported soybean meal, and from either E. Razon,
Inc. or Executive Brokerage Corporation and E.B Marcha Transport Co., Inc. the
value of the undelivered 30 bags of soybean meal, with interest, plus costs of
suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon plaintiff's motions and on the ground of payments in
settlement of its claims against defendants E.B. Marcha Transport Co., Inc.,
Executive Brokerage Corporation and Maritime Co., the case was dismissed as
respect them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The facts, as gathered from the documented evidence, are not
disputed.  Defendant Maritime Company of
the Philippines [on May 1, 1974] loaded 5,974 bags of soybean meal, with a
gross weight of 100 lbs. per bag and a total invoice value (C &amp; F/ Manila)
of $83,374.30 on board its M/S "Zamboanga" in New Orleans, U.S.A.,
for shipment to Monterey Farms Corporation at Manila (Exhs. A, B, 32-B &amp;
32-A).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Upon discharge [on June 28, 1974] of the cargo from the vessel into the custody
of defendant arrastre operator, E. Razon Inc., 173 bags of soybean meal were
found to be in bad order condition arising from spillage.  The spillage amounted to 3,895 lbs. (Exhs.
C, H &amp; 2-Razon).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>When the shipment was delivered by defendant E. Razon, Inc. to the
consignee, a total of 284 bags of soybean meal, weighing 9,953 lbs. was in bad
condition (Exhs. D-1, D-2, 30-Razon &amp; 31-Razon).<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote>Under date of August 9, 1974, the consignee wrote defendant E.
Razon Inc., laying its formal claim for spillage/damage sustained by the
shipment (Exhs. D and 32).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Having paid the consignee the sum of P19,644.05 under the insurance
coverage of the shipment,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> the

11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which, as afore-stated, is now directed against E. Razon, Inc., the arrastre
operator, for spillage/loss, weighing 6,058 lbs., sustained by the additional
111 damaged bags of soybean meal, in the amount of U.S. $845.091 or P5,746.61
(its equivalent in Philippine pesos at the then exchange rate of P6.80 to US
$1.00)."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its Answer<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> to
the complaint, respondent Razon (defendant below) denied responsibility and
liability for the additional loss of 111 bags of soybean meal, alleging that
"the questioned shipment was delivered to the consignee in exactly the
same order, condition and quantity it was received from the carrying
vessel." Respondent Razon alleged further that the claim for indemnity
filed with it by the consignee, Monterey Farms Corporation, "did not
comply with the prescribed period within which to file a claim as provided
under the Management Contract."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article VI, Section 1 of the Management Contract then in force
between respondent Razon and the Bureau of Customs was thus specifically put in
issue.  That provision read, in
pertinent part:</p>

deemed to have been issued, and thereafter, the fifteen day period within which
to file the claim shall commence.  <u>Provided,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Judgment was rendered in
this case on 14 January 1978.  In its
disputed Decision, the trial court, although it found that respondent Razon
"admits spillage/loss while the cargo was in its custody,"
nevertheless, ordered the dismissal of the complaint with costs against
petitioner New Zealand (plaintiff below), upon the ground that "the claim
for spillage/loss was filed with defendant arrastre operator, E. Razon, Inc.,

operator E. Razon, Inc., which attests to the spillage/loss from the additional
damaged bags of soybeans, bears the date of July 9, 1974.  It was rendered upon request of consignee's
broker.  And the examination was
conducted in the presence of the consignee's representative.  Obviously, this examination report is the
certificate of loss, damage, or injury referred to in Article VI, No. 1, of the
Management Contract.  And it appearing
that the formal claim for the spillage/damage was filed with defendant Razon,
Inc. on August 9, 1974 (not August 21, 1974 as asserted by defendant E. Razon,
Inc. in its Memorandum), the same was filed beyond the 15-day period prescribed
by the contract."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

delivered to the consignee in good condition.  Consequently, on <u>20 July 1961</u>, the consignee's broker requested a
bad order examination of the shipment, which was later certified by defendant's
own inspector to be short of three (3) cases.  On <u>15 August 1961</u>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a

claim, arguing that the same had not been filed within fifteen (15) days from
the date of discharge of the shipment from the carrying vessel, as required under
the arrastre Management Contract then in force between itself and the Bureau of
Customs.  The trial court upheld this
argument and hence dismissed the complaint.  On appeal by the consignee, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice
J.B.L. Reyes, reversed the trial court and found the defendant arrastre
operator liable for the value of the lost cargo, explaining as follows:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In other words, what the
Court considered as the crucial factor in declaring the defendant arrastre
operator liable for the loss occasioned, in the <u>Fireman's Fund</u> case, was
the fact that defendant, by virtue of the consignee's request for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">bad order examination, had been able formally to verify the existence
and extent of its liability within fifteen (15) days from the date of discharge
of the shipment from the carrying vessel -- i.e., <u>within the same period
stipulated under the </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Management
</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Contract for the
consignee to file a formal claim</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">.  That </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">formal claim had been filed by the consignee
beyond the stipulated period of fifteen (15) days neither relieved defendant of
liability nor </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">excused payment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">thereof, the purpose of a formal claim, as
contemplated in <u>Consunji</u>, having already been fully served and satisfied
by the consignee's timely request for, and the eventual result of, the bad
order examination of the nylon merchandise shipped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Relating the doctrine of <u>Fireman's
Fund</u> to the case at bar, the record shows that delivery to the warehouse of
consignee Monterey Farms Corporation of the 5,974 bags of soybean meal, had been
completed by respondent Razon (arrastre operator) on 9 July 1974.  <u>On that same day</u>, a bad order
examination of the goods delivered was requested by the consignee and was, in
fact, conducted by respondent Razon's own inspector, in the presence of representatives
of both the Bureau of Customs and the consignee.  The ensuing bad order examination report -- what the trial court
considered a "certificate of loss" -- confirmed that out of the 5,974
bags of soybean meal loaded on board the M/S </span>"Zamboanga" and
shipped to Manila, 173 bags had been damaged <u>in</u> <u>transitu</u> while an
additional 111 bags had been damaged after the entire shipment had been
discharged from the vessel and placed in the custody of respondent Razon.  Hence, as early as <u>9 July 1974</u> (<u>the
date of last delivery to the consignee's warehouse</u>), respondent Razon had
been able to verify and ascertain for itself not only the existence of its
liability to the consignee but, more significantly, the exact amount thereof --
i.e., P5,746.61, representing the value of 111 bags of soybean meal.  We note further that such verification and
ascertainment of liability on the part of respondent Razon, had been
accomplished "within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of last
package to the consignee, broker or importer" as well as "within
fifteen (15) days from the date of issuance by the Contractor [respondent
Razon] of a certificate of loss, damage or injury or certificate of
non-delivery" -- the periods prescribed under Article VI, Section 1 of the
Management Contract here involved, within which a request for certificate of
loss and a formal claim, respectively, must be filed by the consignee or his
agent.  Evidently, therefore, the rule
laid down by the Court in <u>Fireman's Fund</u> finds appropriate application in
the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In its questioned
decision, however, the trial court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. case is not authoritative in

that the certificate of ss referred to in the Management Contract here involved
is very similar to if not identical with the report issued as a result of a bad
order examination.  We think that the
trial court took an unreasonably restrictive view of the applicable provisions
of the Management Contract (quoted earlier).  Under the Management Contract, the consignee had a period of thirty (30)
days from the last delivery of the goods within which to request a certificate
of loss from the arrastre operator.  From the date of such request for a certificate of loss, the arrastre
operator had a period of fifteen (15) days within which to issue a certificate
of loss either actually or constructively.  And from such date of issuance of a certificate of loss, the consignee
had fifteen (15) days within which to file a formal claim with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">all </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">accompanying </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">documentation

course, the consignee had not literally complied with the other proviso of
Article VI, Section 1 of the Management Contract which, in addition, required
the formal claim to be filed with the contractor "<u>within fifteen (15)
days from date of issuance by the contractor of a certificate of loss</u>, damage
or injury or certificate of non-delivery." But the whole purpose of time
limitations for the filing of claims - and this is the thrust of <u>Fireman's
Fund</u> - had already been fully satisfied by the demand of the consignee for
a bad order examination and by the report of the arrastre operator on the
results thereof; the operator had become aware of and had verified the facts
giving rise to its liability.  The
arrastre operator thus suffered no prejudice at all by the lack of literal
compliance with the fifteen (15) day limitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Under these
circumstances, the Court is compelled to hold that the consignee had
substantially complied with the second time requirement of Article VI, Section
1 of the Management Contract and that to release the arrastre operator from
liability the reality and substantive legitimacy of which he does not, and
indeed cannot, dispute, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">intolerable to the conscience of the
Court.  In fact, the reasonableness and
hence the enforceability of the second (15-day) time limitation appears open to
serious question, when conjoined with the first (30-day) prescriptive period;
but this it is not absolutely necessary to determine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court must stress
that respondent E. Razon, being an arrastre operator, is a public utility,
discharging functions which are heavily invested with public interest.  Provisions limiting the liability of a
public utility operator through the imposition of multiple prescriptive periods
for the filing of claims by members of the general public who must deal with
the public utility operator, must be carefully scrutinized and reasonably
construed so as to protect the legitimate interest of the public which the
public utility must serve.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
