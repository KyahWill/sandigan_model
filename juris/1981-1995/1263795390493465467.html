				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction, to declare
Presidential Decree No. 1214 unconstitutional and to enjoin respondent public
officials from enforcing it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="10">19 October 1978</st1:date>, the Court required
the respondents to comment on the petition and issued a temporary restraining
order continuing until otherwise ordered by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Santa Rosa Mining Company, Inc. (petitioner, for
short) is a mining corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It alleges that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">it is the holder of fifty (50) valid mining claims situated in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte,
acquired under the provisions of the Act of the U.S. Congress dated </span><st1:date year="1902" day="1" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">1 July
 1902</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> (Philippine
Bill of 1902, for short).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="10">14 October 1977</st1:date>,
Presidential Decree No. 1214 was issued, requiring holders of subsisting and
valid patentable mining claims located under the provisions of the Philippine
Bill of 1902 to file a <u>mining lease application</u> within one (1) year from
the approval of the Decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
accordingly filed a mining lease application, but "under protest", on
<st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="10">13 October 1978</st1:date>, with a
reservation annotated on the back of its application that it is not waiving its
rights over its mining claims until the validity of Presidential Decree No.
1214 shall have been passed upon by this Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 October 1978, or three (3) days before filing the disputed
mining lease application, petitioner filed this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition, alleging that it has no other plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law to protect its rights (except by said
petition).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner assails
Presidential Decree No. 1214 as unconstitutional in that it amounts to a
deprivation of property without due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner avers that its
fifty (50) mining claims had already been declared as its own private and
exclusive </span>property in final judgments rendered by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte (CFI, for short) in land
registration proceedings initiated by third persons, such as, a September 1951
land title application by a certain <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>, where the Director of Mines opposed the grant of
said application because herein petitioner, according to him (Director of
Mines), had already located and perfected its mining claims over the area
applied for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also cites LRC
Case No. 240, filed <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="7">11 July 1960</st1:date>,
by one Antonio <span class="SpellE">Astudillo</span>, and decided in 1974 against
said applicant, in which, petitioner's mining claims were described as vested
property outside the jurisdiction of the Director of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">Mines</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer, the respondents allege that petitioner has no standing
to file the instant petition as it failed to fully exhaust administrative
remedies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of petitioner's appeal, with the Office of the
President, of the ruling of the respondent Secretary of Natural Resources
issued on 2 April 1977 in DNR Case No. 4140, which upheld the decision of the
Director of Mines finding that forty four (44) out of petitioner's fifty (50)
mining claims were void for lack of valid "tie points" as required
under the Philippine Bill of 1902, and that all the mining claims had already
been abandoned and cancelled, for petitioner's non-compliance with the legal
requirements of the same Phil. Bill of 1902 and Executive Order no. 141<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with respondents' contention that it is premature for
the Court to now make a finding on the matter of whether petitioner had
abandoned its mining claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Until
petitioner's appeal shall have been decided by the Office of the President,
where it is pending, petitioner's attempt to seek judicial recognition of the
continuing validity of its mining claims, cannot be entertained by the
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the Court, through
Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> Padilla in <u>Ham v. <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> Motor Co. Inc</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>,
applying the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"By its own act of appealing from the
decision of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources to the President of the Philippines, and without waiting for the
latter's decision, the defendant cannot complain if the courts do not take
action before the President has decided its appeal"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decisions of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte in applications for land registration filed
by third persons covering the area over which petitioner had located and
registered its mining claims, as cited by petitioner, are inapplicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said decisions merely denied the applications
of such third persons for land registration over areas already covered by
petitioner's mining claims, for failure to show titles that were <span class="SpellE">registrable</span> under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system; that was all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the CFI made
a statement in one case declaring that the petitioner's mining claims are its
vested property and <u>even patentable at that time</u>, there is nothing in
said CFI decision that squarely passed upon the question of whether petitioner
had valid, patentable (but still unpatented) mining claims which it had <u>continued</u>
to <u>maintain</u>, in compliance with the requirements of applicable
laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This question which involves a
finding of facts, is precisely the issue before the Office of the President in
the petitioner's appeal from the decision of the Secretary of Natural Resources
in DNR Case No. 4140 holding that petitioner's mining claims are considered
abandoned and cancelled for failure of petitioner to comply with the
requirements of the Philippine Bill of 1902 and Executive Order no. 141.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In short, the decisions of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, relied upon by
petitioner, do not foreclose a proceeding, such as DNR Case No. 4140, to
determine whether petitioner's <u>unpatented</u> mining claims have remained
valid and subsisting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents further contend that, even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that petitioner's mining claims were valid
at the outset, if they are deemed abandoned and cancelled due to non-compliance
with the legal requirements for maintaining a perfected mining claim, under the
provisions of the Philippine Bill of 1902<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,
petitioner has no valid and subsisting claim which could be lost through the
implementation of Presidential Decree no. 1214, thus giving it no standing to
question the Decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, on the other hand, would rebut respondents' argument
by declaring that it already had a vested right over its mining claims even
before Presidential Decree No. 1214, following the rulings in <u>McDaniel v. <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span></u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and <u>Gold Creek Mining Corp v. Rodriguez</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not impressed that this is so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases cited by petitioner, true enough, recognize the right
of a locator of a mining claim as a property right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This right, however is not absolute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is merely a <span class="SpellE">possesory</span>
right, more so, in this case, where petitioner's claims are still
unpatented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They can be lost through abandonment
or forfeiture or they may be revoked for valid legal grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statement in <u>McDaniel v. <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span></u> that "There is no pretense in the present
case that the petitioner has not complied with all the requirements of the law
in making the location of the mineral claims in question, or that the claims in
question <u>were ever abandoned or forfeited by him</u>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>,
confirms that a valid mining claim may still be lost through abandonment or
forfeiture.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner can not successfully plead the ruling in <u>Gold
Creek Mining Corp. v. Rodriguez</u>, supra.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In that case, what was in issue was <u>Gold Creek's</u> right to a
patent over its mining claim, <u>after compliance with all legal requirements
for a patent</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case,
no application for patent is in issue, although as a holder of <u>patentable</u>
mining claims petitioner could have applied for one during all these years but
inexplicably did not do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Gold
Creek</u>, no finding of abandonment was ever made against the mining claimant
as to deprive it of the initial privilege given by virtue of its location; on
the other hand, such a finding has been made in petitioner's case (although the
finding among others is on appeal with the President).</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the question of whether or not Presidential Decree
No. 1214 is constitutional.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that petitioner was not
bound to exhaust administrative remedies on the question of whether or not its
mining claims are still subsisting (not abandoned or cancelled), before
challenging the constitutionality of said Decree, we hold that Presidential
Decree No. 1214 is not unconstitutional<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a valid exercise of the sovereign power
of the State, as owner, over lands of the public domain, of which petitioner's
mining claims <u>still</u> form a part, and over the patrimony of the nation,
of which mineral deposits are a valuable asset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It may be underscored, in this connection, that the Decree does not
cover all mining claims located under the Phil. Bill of 1902, but <u>only those
claims over which their locators had failed to obtain a patent</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even then, such locators may still avail
of the <u>renewable</u> twenty-five year (25) lease prescribed by Pres. Dec.
No. 463, the Mineral Development Resources Decree of 1974.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mere location does not mean absolute ownership over the affected
land or the mining claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It merely
segregates the located land or area from the public domain by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">barring other would-be locators from locating
the same and appropriating for themselves the minerals found therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To rule otherwise would imply that location
is all that is needed to <u>acquire</u> and <u>maintain</u> rights over a
located mining claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, we cannot
approve or sanction because it is contrary to the intention of the lawmaker
that the locator should faithfully and consistently comply with the requirements
for annual work and improvements in the located mining claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Presidential Decree No.
1214 is in accord with Sec. 8, Art. XIV of the 1973 Constitution which states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal,
petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries,
wildlife, and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the

agricultural, industrial or commercial, residential and resettlement lands of
the public domain, natural resources shall not be alienated, and no license,
concession, or lease for the exploration, development, exploitation, or
utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted for a period
exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years,
except <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">as </span>to water rights for
irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the
development of water power, in which cases, beneficial use may be the measure
