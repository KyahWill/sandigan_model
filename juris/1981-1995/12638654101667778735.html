<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="11"><span style="">November
 13, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, the eldest daughter, who </span>was at the <span style="">time about 15 </span>years <span style="">old, asked her mother <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
how a </span><span style="">conceiving woman </span><span style="">felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Florencia</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">inquired
from her daughter why she was asking such a question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> confessed
to her mother that she was </span>not having her monthly menstruation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pressed by her mother as to who was
responsible for what happened to her, <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
revealed that sometime in September, 1984 her father Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Herico</span> abused her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> confronted Benjamin and asked him why he raped
his own daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin just replied,
"just for that, you already got angry?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">para</span> yon <span class="SpellE"><span style="">lang</span></span><span style=""> ay <span class="SpellE">nagalit</span> ka <span class="SpellE">na</span>?)"
<span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> then admonished her husband not to repeat what
he did to their daughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of that same day, Benjamin told <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> that since she already knew what happened to <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, then <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> would sleep
with him that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then tried to
pull <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> inside the room and there was a struggle
among Benjamin, <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin removed his pants and brief and he
tried to undress <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> undressed
herself and asked Benjamin to do to her what he wanted <span style="">to </span>do to their daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Benjamin replied that if she wanted it that way, she would be the
next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then boxed the left leg of <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> who was trying to fight him off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He threatened the two that if they would stop
him in having sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, he
would kill all of them, including the small kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even pointed his knife at the neck of <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> who was then boxing him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> was a sickly girl who was not
even able to go to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She therefore
became an easy prey of her father.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, Benjamin successfully raped his daughter <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> in the very presence of his wife that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the <span class="SpellE">consumation</span>
of the dastardly act, Benjamin stood up, put on <span style="">his brief and pants and went to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> and </span><span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
went to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and there, together with <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rhodora</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maricris</span> spent the whole night crying.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maritess</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Rhodora</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maricris</span> were at the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> crying
while Benjamin was raping his daughter <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although they did not see the actual sexual
abuse, <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> at least knew that something bad was
happening inside the room, for they could hear the crying and plea for help of
their mother </span>and their sister <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the next several days, Benjamin,
showed contempt and was always angry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His wife and children were all the more frightened.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1984</st1:date>,
Benjamin left for <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before leaving, however, he threatened his
wife and children that he would kill them if they ever tell anybody about the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>
to engage in gold panning.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1985</st1:date>,
he returned to their residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
evening of the following day, <span class="SpellE">Bejamin</span> called his wife
and told her that <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> who was then 13 years old
would sleep with him in the same room where he raped <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
pleaded with Benjamin not to rape <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She once more offered herself to Benjamin
who, as in the rape of <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, told <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> that if she liked to have sex, she would be
next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then dragged <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> inside the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He, however, met strong opposition from <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl having learned about the fate of <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, although terribly afraid of her father, tried to
fight him, kicking her father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
refusal was met with physical violence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was boxed by her father and when she fell, Benjamin <span style="">kicked her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> was still young and naturally
weak, Benjamin was able to rape <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He touched the breasts and private part of <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>, placed himself on top of her and forcibly entered
the girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl shouted because of
the extreme pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that when <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>
was boxed, because of fear, <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> urinated even
when she still had her clothes and underwear on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This even angered Benjamin and caused him to
once more kick <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> and called her "<span class="SpellE">bastos</span>" (rude).</p>

<p class="BODY">After Benjamin inserted his penis to the private part of <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>, the girl shouted for help from her mother crying,
"<span class="SpellE">Inay</span>, <span class="SpellE">masakit</span>, <span class="SpellE">tulungan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>." (Mother it is painful, please help me).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After raping <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>,
once more <span style="">Benjamin went to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> left the room and went to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
where they cried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> was not like <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was not
contented by just crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did a
positive act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the early morning of <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1985</st1:date> or just a few hours
after she was raped by her father, she went to the house of her uncle Nestor, a
younger brother of Benjamin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
narrated to Nestor what his brother Benjamin did to her and to her sister <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nestor was
angry and furious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He waited until the
5th of March and then went to see his brother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nestor, however, did not immediately inform his brother that <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> complained to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He arrived in the house of Benjamin at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, engaged his brother in a
drinking spree and in the evening of that day at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>, hacked and tried to kill <span style="">Benjamin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Benjamin shouted and asked Nestor why he was being hacked and Nestor
replied that he was killing the devil in Benjamin's body because he raped his
daughters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While this incident was going on, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
and her children ran to a billiard hall <span style="">in
</span>their place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then reported
the incident to <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> councilman <span class="SpellE">Henio</span> <span style="">Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hernandez went to the army camp near the
place and reported the incident to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Benjamin was also able to run away
from Nestor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise went to the
billiard hall and it was there where Hernandez and his companions found the
accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of the next day, Hernandez requested <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> to help him in bringing Benjamin to a hospital in
<span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After bringing Benjamin to the hospital, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
reported to the police station of <span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, the rape perpetrated by Benjamin on her
daughters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also wrote a letter to
her children <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>
<span style="">who ran away to </span><st1:place><span style="">Malaya</span></st1:place><span style=""> at <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte
asking them to return to <span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span> inasmuch as Benjamin
was already in the hospital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span>,
gave her statement to the police and filed a rape complaint against her
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was also examined by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Generosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>
on <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1985</st1:date> who
confirmed that <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> was really sexually abused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same doctor also examined <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> and she found that she was also sexually molested.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>the examination
of <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span> issued a medical certificate<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which contained the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Redness of perineum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vagina
admits one finger with ease.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hymen-presence of lacerations at 3 and <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5 o'clock</st1:time>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lacerations were caused by the penetration of a male
organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the examination of <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>
also found that the girl sustained healed lacerations of the vagina showing
that she was no longer a virgin.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, </span>in due
course, two (2) separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for rape were
filed against Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Herico</span> in the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Calawag</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the arraignment wherein the accused
pleaded not guilty and the trial on the merits, <span style="">a </span>decision was rendered by the trial court on <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1989</st1:date>, convicting the accused
of the crimes of rape of his daughters <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> imposing on him the following penalties:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appealing from the said decision to this Court, the accused now
alleges that the trial court committed the following errors:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Lower Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><span style="">the first assigned error whereby the appellant
</span><span style="">claims </span><span style="">he was deprived of due process where on one
hearing </span><span style="">his counsel </span><span style="">failed </span><span style="">to appear, the </span><span style="">trial
court considered presentation </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">further evidence of the appellant
</span><span style="">to be waived </span><span style="">and the prosecution presented </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">rebuttal evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What </span><span style="">the records </span><span style="">show is </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">counsel </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">record in </span><span style="">said hearing was absent without appropriate explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the court appointed a counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> to assist the appellant until the case
was submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
occasion that the appellant was deprived the assistance of counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant attempted
to discredit the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Herico</span>, his wife, on the basis of an alleged illicit
relation between her and another man whom the appellant cannot even
pinpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's allegation is
that during the hacking incident where he was the victim, and where his own
brother Nestor hacked him, the former was supposedly assisted by two other
persons whom he did not identify.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He also called attention
to the fact that when he called for help, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
who was then present, did not do anything to thwart the blows of Nestor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In debunking this defense
of the appellant the trial court had this to say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The accused tried to convince the court that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> has a paramour.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is hogwash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was just<span style=""> </span>an afterthought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to show to the court that the person
who hacked him was the paramour of <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not, however, name who this paramour
was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anyhow, the evidence is very clear that it was his younger brother
Nestor <span class="SpellE">Herico</span> who hacked him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason why Nestor hacked him was because
Nestor wanted to kill the devil in the body of Benjamin who urged Benjamin to
rape his own daughters."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant also contends
that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> was inconsistent when she testified
that her daughter <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> confessed to </span>her in
September, 1974 and thereafter said it was on November, 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the alleged inconsistency is on
a minor matter which rather than affecting the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>, it is an indication of her truthfulness and
candor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, appellant argues that it is incredible that, as <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> testified, Nestor would engage appellant in a
social conversation for four (4) hours before suddenly trying to kill him and,
that it is more believable that he was treacherously hacked by three <span style="">(3) </span>men, including his brother and the
paramour of <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">What appears from the record, however, is that Nestor when to see
Benjamin and engaged him in a drinking spree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they have had enough liquor, Nestor decided to assault and kill the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also avers that <span style="">if it </span>is true that he raped his daughter <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>,
then it is difficult to understand why, after he left for <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> did not report the alleged rape of <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> to the proper authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also points out that after he allegedly
raped <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> <span style="">on
</span>March 2, 1985 <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> did not report the
same for the next three days and that his family continued to live with him
during the said period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is
obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
was so afraid of the appellant so she did not report his dastardly acts to the
proper authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant then calls attention to the fact that his daughters <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span> visited him
in the <span style="">hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin is still their father so they
visited him, although he had raped them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense of appellant
is denial and alibi in that on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="3"><span style="">March 2, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, he was at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Sta. <span class="SpellE">Ines</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> working to earn a living for his family so that he
could not have committed the alleged rape of his daughter <span class="SpellE">Maritess</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then and again, the Court has declared that alibi is the weakest
of all defenses, easy to concoct and difficult to believe and such alibi cannot
prevail over the positive assertion of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rape is indeed a heinous crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More so, the manner in which the offense was committed in this case,
where the <span style="">victims are the very
daughters of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To add insult to
injury, the appellant raped his daughters in the very presence of their
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the appellant
deserves no mercy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He deserves the
supreme penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, under
the present Constitution, the penalty of death cannot be imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is about time that Congress should consider reviving the death
