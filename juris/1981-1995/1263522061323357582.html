This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Aklan, 11th Judicial District, Branch III finding defendant-appellant 
Ilarde Itura guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER, 
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and
 ordering him to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Felix Renacido in 
the sum of Twelve Thousand (P12,000.00) Pesos for the death of the 
victim, Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos for moral damages, Five 
Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos for exemplary damages, One Thousand Two 
Hundred Seventy (P1,270.00) Pesos for the coffin, and expenses for 
religious services as well as attorney's fees, and Three Thousand 
(P3,000.00) Pesos for other expenses.
<p>
The information dated September 30, 1975 charged Ilarde Itura and Crispin Naelga with having committed murder as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 13th day of May, 1975, at Barrio Catabana, 
Municipality of Madalag, Province of Aklan, Republic of the Philippines,
 and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused armed with deadly weapon, consisting of fighting bolos, with 
intent to kill and with evident premeditation and treachery, conspiring,
 confederating, and mutually helping one another, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, and bolo one FELIX
 RENACIDO on the different parts of his body, thereby inflicting 
physical injuries upon the victim, Felix Renacido, to wit: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "'1.    Stab wound - left side below the clavicle going downward
 (4 inches in length, 3-1/2 inches depth, 1/2 inch wide involving the 
heart; </p>
    <p> "'2.    Stab wound - distal portion of the arm 4 inches from the left elbow going up cutting the bone; </p>
    <p> "'3.    Stab wound - left starting at the level of the umbilicus
 along the mid clavicular line reaching the spinal column but not 
cutting the spinal cord traversing the transverse column and ascending 
column; </p>
    <p> "'4.    Stab wound - left thigh 6 inches from inguinal region, 4
 inches 1 length, 3 inches in depth, and 1/2 inch width cutting the 
femoral artery; </p>
    <p> "'5.    Stab wound - 4 inches above the left knee, 6 inches in length, 2 inches in depth, and 1 inch in width; </p>
    <p> "'6.    Stab wound - at the level of the nape cutting the 
cervical vertibrae, 6 inches in length, 3 inches depth, and 1 inch 
width; and </p>
    <p> "'7.    Lacerated wound - distal portion of the forearm above the wrist right side 1 inch length.' </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "As per Medical Certificate marked Annex 'A' and made integral 
part of this Information, signed by Sofronio A. Navales, Rural 
Sanitation Inspector of Madalag, Aklan, which injuries caused the 
instantaneous death of Felix Renacido. </p>
  <p> "That in the commission of the crime, the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation is present; </p>
  <p> "That as a result of the criminal acts of the accused, the heirs of Felix Renacido suffered the following damages: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "1.    P12,000.00 for the death of the victim; and </p>
    <p> "2.    P20,000.00 for moral damages."
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
On October 27, 1975, defendant-appellants Ilarde Itura and Crispin 
Naelga, with the assistance of counsel Jose Salazar, waived the formal 
reading of the information and pleaded "not guilty" to the offense 
charged.
</p><p>
On March 30, 1976, however, Crispin Naelga withdrew his earlier plea of 
not guilty and pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of homicide to which
 Assistant Provincial Fiscal Pedro Cordova expressed no objection 
provided the information would not be amended.  The Court explained to 
Crispin Naelga the consequences of his plea of guilty.  Crispin Naelga 
reiterated his plea of guilty and declared that he killed Felix Renacido
 because the latter "embarrassed him."
</p><p>
Crispin Naelga was re-arraigned and after he pleaded guilty to the 
lesser offense of homicide, he was forthwith sentenced to an 
indeterminate prison term of SIX (6) YEARS and EIGHT (8) MONTHS of <em>Prision Mayor</em> as minimum to TWELVE (12) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>Reclusion Temporal</em>
 as maximum; to indemnify the heirs of Felix Renacido in the sum of 
P12,000.00 for the death of the victim, P20,000.00 for moral damages and
 to pay the costs without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.
  Crispin Naelga was also given full credit for his preventive 
imprisonment starting from May 26, 1975.
</p><p>
Trial proceeded against the defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura only.
</p><p>
On June 29, 1976, Porferio Mirano, prosecution eyewitness, implicated 
Rafael Sailog, another prosecution witness, as one of the killers of 
Felix Renacido.  Thereafter, Fiscal Tesorero verbally petitioned the 
Court for a suspension of the hearing of the case, and asked that the 
office of the provincial fiscal be given time to re-investigate the case
 against Rafael Sailog, assess the evidence of the state, and determine 
whether it is enough to sustain a conviction.
</p><p>
On June 30, 1976, the court suspended the hearings and gave the 
provincial fiscal time within which to conduct a re-investigation.
</p><p>
After the re-investigation by the fiscal, an amended information dated 
April 19, 1977 was filed.  The amended information now included Rafael 
Sailog as one of the accused.
</p><p>
The facts established by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court as basis for its decision are summarized as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The evidence of the prosecution tends to establish the following:
  At around 1:30 o'clock in the afternoon of May 13, 1975 the herein 
accused killed Felix Renacido at Barrio Catabana, Madalag, Aklan, which 
is around twenty (20) meters to the house of spouses Carmelita Naelga 
and Rafael Sailog.  With the use of a fighting bolo (Exh. 'A'), accused 
Ilardo Itura was the first one to bolo the victim, Felix Renacido.  Then
 accused Crispin Naelga – who had previously pleaded guilty to the 
offense of homicide – next boloed the deceased while accused Rafael 
Sailog used an ax (Exh. '4' of the accused Rafael Sailog and Exh. 'E' of
 the prosecution). </p>
  <p> "The deceased, Felix Renacido suffered seven (7) wounds, as shown in the medical certificate (Exh. B), which are as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Wound No. 1 is a stab wound, just at the left side below the 
clavicle going downward (4 inches in length, 3-1/2 inches depth, 1/2 
inch wide) involving the heart. </p>
    <p> "Wound No. 2 is a stab wound - distal portion of the arm 4 inches from the left elbow going up cutting the bone. </p>
    <p> "Wound No. 3 is another stab wound - left starting at the level 
of the umbilicus along the mid clavicle line reaching the spinal column 
but not cutting the spinal cord traversing the transverse column and 
ascending column. </p>
    <p> "Wound No. 4 is another stab wound - left thigh 6 inches from 
inguinal region, 4 inches length, 3 inches in depth and 1/2 inch width 
cutting the femoral artery. </p>
    <p> "Wound No. 5 is another stab wound - 4 inches above the left knee, 6 inches in length, 2 inches in depth and 1 inch in width. </p>
    <p> "Wound No. 6 is another stab wound - at the left of the nape 
cutting the cervical vertebrae, 6 inches in length, 3 inches in depth 
and 1 inch width. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "The seventh wound is a lacerated wound - distal portion of the forearm above the wrist right side 1 inch length. </p>
  <p> "Cause of death appears to be hemorrhage due to multiple wounds (Exhs. "B" and "B-1"). </p>

  <p> "Prosecution witness, Porferio Mirano who was at the time he 
testified on June 29, 1976, 38 years old, married, farmer and a resident
 of Bulabud, Malinao, Aklan, and who was then testifying under the 
original information above-referred to in which the accused were then 
only Ilarde Itura and Crispin Naelga, declared among other, as follows: 
 He has known accused Ilarde Itura some five to ten years.  He has also 
known the deceased Felix Renacido for quite a time.  He has also known 
the other accused Crispin Naelga for two years before 1975.  In the 
course of his testimony he identified accused Ilarde Itura in open 
court.  He went further to state that in the afternoon of May 13, 1975 
at around 1:00 he was in the ricefield at Catabana, Madalag, Aklan.  At 
around 1:30 o'clock that afternoon he was then resting in a shade just 
near the land he was farming.  He was just then around twenty to thirty 
meters to the house of Carmelita Naelga and Rafael Sailog.  While thus 
resting, he saw Carmelita Naelga, wife of Rafael Sailog, Felix Renacido 
and another one who came later and who was the wife of Felix Renacido.  
They were then coming from the house of Felix Renacido, walking and 
following a trail on the rice dike into the lower portion towards the 
house of the said spouses Rafael Sailog and Carmelita Naelga.  Crispin 
Naelga was ahead, followed by Felix Renacido and later on the latter's 
wife came. </p>
  <p> "Upon reaching near the house of said spouses Rafael Sailog and 
Carmelita Naelga he saw accused Ilarde Itura who first boloed Felix 
Renacido with the use of a fighting bolo.  Accused, Crispin Naelga 
boloed also Felix Renacido with the use also of a fighting bolo, then 
Rafael Sailog struck Felix Renacido with the use of an ax.  Accused, 
Ilarde Itura boloed Felix Renacido twice, hitting Felix Renacido first 
at the back of his neck while the second blow landed on the left thigh 
of the victim, Felix Renacido.  And accused, Crispin Naelga, the second 
person who assaulted Felix Renacido struck the deceased on his belly, 
then on his upper left arm and then on his right breast.  The deceased 
fell down.  After he fell down, accused Crispin Naelga had again boloed 
Felix Renacido.  The third one to assault Felix Renacido with an ax was 
Rafael Sailog, then a prosecution witness in the original information in
 this case. </p>
  <p> "After he had boloed Felix Renacido, accused Ilarde Itura was 
talking in a loud voice, 'What are you waiting for, you kill him.' Then 
accused, Crispin Naelga, assaulted the victim, Felix Renacido.  This 
killing of Felix Renacido was just 10 to 15 meters to the house of the 
prosecution witness, Rafael Sailog and Carmelita Naelga. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The body of the deceased Felix Renacido was examined on May 14, 1975 by 
Sofronio Navales a Rural Sanitation Inspector of Madalag, Aklan who 
issued the Medical Certificate with findings found in the information 
and sustained by the trial court.
</p><p>
The records show that the court took adequate steps to confirm the 
capability of Sofronio N. Navales, a Rural Sanitation Inspector since 
1951 to perform autopsies in the absence of a Rural Health Physician.  
The records further show that on May 13, 1975, Dr. Henry Taay, the Rural
 Health Physician of the town was on leave while Dr. Bueno of Libacao, 
Aklan, who was supposed to be detailed to the Municipality of Madalag 
did not report for duty and was not available.
</p><p>
Defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura denied any participation in the 
commission of the crime.  He admitted having witnessed the crime as a 
mere bystander but pointed to Crispin Naelga as the only person 
responsible for the killing of Felix Renacido.  His defense states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On May 13, 1975 after having had his lunch, defendant-appellant 
Ilarde Itura went out of his house to look for laborers to work in his 
rice field.  But as almost everybody was busy that afternoon, he was not
 able to find any.  As he was passing along the downstream side of 
Barangay Catabana still looking for laborers and before almost reaching 
the river, he met his nephew Crispin Naelga who claimed to be looking 
for the victim Felix Renacido.  The defendant-appellant was told that 
Crispin Naelga would like to have himself treated of his stomachache by 
the victim.  They went together for a while but as they neared the house
 of Rafael Sailog, they met Felix Renacido.  Thereupon Crispin Naelga 
boloed several times the victim Felix Renacido on the different parts of
 his body and although the defendant-appellant admonished to stop the 
attack, Crispin Naelga continued until the victim lay prostrate on the 
ground. </p>
  <p> "As he was afraid, he hurriedly left the place (Tsn. Hearing of 
June 6, 1979, pp. 10-15) Crispin Naelga was later brought by his 
brother-in-law Rafael Sailog to the Barangay Captain and together, they 
surrendered to the police authorities.  After investigation, the Chief 
of Police filed against Crispin Naelga and defendant-appellant Ilarde 
Itura a complaint for murder before the Municipal Court of Madalag, 
Aklan.  After due investigation, the Assistant Provincial Fiscal filed 
the information against defendant-appellant and Crispin Naelga which was
 subsequently amended to include Rafael Sailog. </p>
  <p> "Crispin Naelga later claimed at the trial of the case, moments 
before he pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of homicide, that the 
deceased Felix Renacido had embarrassed him and hurt him and that was 
the reason why he killed him.  (Tsn, Hearing of March 30, 1916, p. 4)"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In its decision dated October 20, 1981, the trial court found the 
qualifying circumstance of treachery to be present and convicted 
defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura of the crime of MURDER.  Rafael Sailog 
was acquitted on grounds of reasonable doubt.  The dispositive portion 
of the decision reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Ilarde Itura GUILTY beyond 
reasonable doubt of Murder as charged in the information.  There being 
no aggravating nor any mitigating circumstance, the Court hereby 
sentences him therefore to suffer the penalty of <em>RECLUSION PERPETUA</em>.
  With costs against the accused.  He is hereby however given full 
credit of his preventive imprisonment starting from May 26, 1975 to 
November 3, 1977, on which latter date accused Ilarde Itura was released
 upon posting a bail bond. </p>
  <p> "Accused Ilarde Itura is hereby ordered to indemnify the heirs of 
Felix Renacido in the sum of P12,000.00 for the death of the victim, 
P20,000.00 for moral damages and P5,000.00 for exemplary damages.  He is
 hereby further ordered to pay the heirs of the victim the sum of 
P1,270.00 for the coffin and expenses for religious service as well as 
attorney's fees and for other expenses amounting to P3,000.00. </p>
  <p> "Accused Rafael Sailog is hereby declared ACQUITTED.  His immediate release is hereby ordered."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defendant-appellant raised a lone assignment of error in his appeal -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT, 
ILARDE ITURA, PARTICIPATED IN THE KILLING OF THE DECEASED FELIX RENACIDO
 AND THEREFORE FINDING HIM GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER AS CHARGED AND 
SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF <em>RECLUSION PERPETUA</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Defendant-appellant himself admits that appellate courts will generally 
not disturb the factual findings of the trial court unless the latter 
has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that if 
considered might affect the result of the case.
</p><p>
A perusal of the records shows that the defendant-appellant has failed 
to satisfy this Court why his case should be an exception to the 
above-stated general rule on the respect to be given to factual findings
 of the trial court.
</p><p>
The defendant-appellant contends that he was convicted not on the basis 
of the testimonies of the original prosecution witnesses but on the 
basis of the testimonies of Porferio Mirano, Azucena Tornino, and Roseno
 Zausa who were presented to establish the guilt of the accused Rafael 
Sailog, not his guilt.
</p><p>
We find no merit in this contention.  The records show that 
defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura was convicted on the basis of evidence 
given before and after the amendment of the information.  The trial 
court relied on the eyewitness account of Porferio Mirano which was 
corroborated by the affidavits of Rafael Sailog and his wife.  The trial
 court ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "From the testimony of prosecution witness Porferio Mirano on June
 29, 1976 who then testified on the original information, in which the 
accused were only Ilarde Itura and Crispin Naelga, the Court finds that 
the prosecution has been able to establish the guilt of herein accused 
Ilarda Itura by proof beyond reasonable doubt.  His testimony has been 
corroborated by the sworn statement of prosecution witness Racal Sailog 
and by the sworn statement of his wife (Exhs. 'F' and 'H', 
respectively)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Porferio Mirano testifying under the original information, positively 
identified defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura as the person who first 
boloed Felix Renacido twice with the use of a fighting bole hitting 
Felix first at the back of his neck and then on the left thigh of the 
victim.  He testified:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q   While you ware resting, did you notice any person within your vicinity, within your eyesight? </p>
  <p> "A    Yes, sir. </p>
  <p> "Q   Who were the persons you saw at that time? </p>
  <p> "A    Carmelita Sailog, wife of Rafael Sailog, Felix Renacido and 
another one who came later was the wife of Felix Renacido, Azucena 
Tornino."

<p>
    Porferio Mirano again positively implicated defendant-appellant

23, 1978:

<p>
While it is true that Rafael Sailog and Carmelita Naelga partially 
repudiated these affidavits when Rafael Sailog became hostile after 
Crispin Naelga had pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of homicide, we 
find no reason to disturb the trial court's conclusion that the partial 
repudation by Rafael Sailog and Carmelita Naelga of their sworn 
statements was an afterthought, a product of premeditation, reflection, 
and design to exculpate defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura who is the 
uncle of Carmelita Naelga, considering that Crispin Naelga had already 
pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of homicide.  The lower court 
stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "While Rafael Sailog declared, among others, that he made a 
mistake in his sworn statement because when he peeped to the window he 
only saw the deceased Felix Renacido flat on the ground while Crispin 
Naelga was standing, holding a bolo and Ilarde Itura was just standing 
by without doing anything, the court gives more weight to these two 
sworn statements (Exhs. "F" and "H") by Rafael Sailog and his wife than 
to his later denial arising from his hostile attitude because at the 
time these sworn statements (Exhs. "F" and "H") were made on May 19, 
1975 the circumstances then existing at that time these affidavits were 
made render improbable that a motive to falsify them exist.  These sworn
 statements, Exhibits "F" and "H", executed some six (6) days after the 
killing were evidently not made under the influence of a motive to 
misrepresent.  The surrounding circumstances then obtaining at the time 
they were executed constitute a strong guarantee of truth to the 
statement that accused Ilarde Itura was one of those who killed Felix 
Renacido.  While the statements in the above-mentioned sworn statements 
may not be part of the <em>res gestae,</em> it is certain that 
circumstances were such that there can be no incentive on the part of 
Rafael Sailog and his wife Carmelita Naelga to color the facts or 
deliberately make a fabrication of them."

<p>
Rosendo Zausa and Azucena Tornino likewise positively identified and 
implicated defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura as one of the killers of the
 deceased Felix Renacido.
</p><p>
Appellant next argues that there were three (3) different persons who 
participated in the killing of the deceased, yet there was only one bolo
 presented as evidence and this was the one that was surrendered by 
Crispin Naelga to the police authorities.
</p><p>
The prosecution has clearly demonstrated the direct participation of 
defendant-appellant Itura in the killing of Felix Renacido.  We agree 
with the Solicitor General that the direct testimony of eyewitnesses 
Porferio Mirano, Rosendo Zausa and Azucena Tornino, sufficiently 
corroborated by the affidavits of Rafael Sailog and Carmelita Naelga has
 overcome the absence of the other bolo used by the appellant (<em>People v. Jovellano</em>,
 56 SCRA 156).  The fact that only one bolo was surrendered to the 
authorities does not alter the fact that Felix Renacido was killed and 
that defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura was positively identified as one 
of those who inflicted the multiple wounds suffered by the victim.
</p><p>
The defendant-appellant further argues that the failure of the 
eyewitnesses to immediately report the killing to the police 
authorities, to make a statement of what they saw, or to confide the 
incident to their wives raises doubt on the veracity of their testimony.
  Defendant-appellant submits that their silence strongly indicates the 
falsity of their narrations.
</p><p>
The delay in reporting the killing was explained.  The fact that the 
eyewitnesses did not immediately report the incident to the authorities 
does not diminish their credibility nor render their testimony biased.
</p><p>
The delay was sufficiently explained by Porferio Mirano when he testified:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q   After May 13, 1975 did it not occur to you to report to the 
chief of police in Madalag and tell them that you have a knowledge of 
the occurrence? </p>
  <p> "A    We talked on that matter but the younger brother of Felix 
Renacido objected that we rather wait for the children of Felix Renacido
 who were at that time all in Manila. </p>
  <p> "Q   So inspite of the fact that you have a knowledge of the 
incident you did not go to the Office of the Chief of Police of Madalag 
to tell then about your knowledge? </p>
  <p> "ATTY. ICAMINA: </p>
  <p> "Already answered, that they talked with the brother and decided to wait for the children. </p>
  <p> "COURT: </p>
  <p>
    Witness may answer.
  </p>
  <p> "A    No, sir, because I was waiting for the children of the deceased victim so that I could tell them the whole story."
  </p>
  <p>
    (TSN., Gilda Esmeralda, June 30, 1976, pp. 17-18)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The other points raised by the defendant-appellant in his brief pertain 
to the same issue of credibility of witnesses.  After carefully going 
over the records of the case, we find that these points are not of value
 and substance that could affect the result of the case.
</p><p>
The crime committed was murder.  The qualifying circumstance of 
treachery was present.  Defendant-appellant Ilarde Itura joined in the 
killing of Felix Renacido employing means, methods, or forms in the 
execution thereof which tended directly and specially to insure its 
execution, without risk to the killers arising from the defense which 
the offended party might make (Article 14, Par. 16, Revised Penal Code).
  Felix Renacido, when attacked, was entirely defenseless and 
defendant-appellant Itura and his companion or companions were not 
exposed to any risk that might come from the former since he was not in a
 position to retaliate.  The attack was sudden and unexpected.
</p><p>
Conspiracy and evident premeditation were not sufficiently proven by the prosecution.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED. 
 The award for damages is, however, modified such that, instead of 
separate indemnifications for the death of the victim, for moral 
damages, and for exemplary damages, a straight death indemnity for 
Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos is imposed.  In all other respects, 
the decision of the court <em>a quo</em> is affirmed.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Relova</em>, and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
