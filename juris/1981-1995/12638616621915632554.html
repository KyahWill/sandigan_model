				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Two (2) errors present themselves for correction in the
proceedings at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first consists in the strict and literal application by the
Appellate Court on September 21, 1985,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the doctrine laid down in <span class="SpellE"><i>Habaluyas</i></span><i>
Enterprise, <span class="SpellE">lnc</span>., et al. v. Hon <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
N <span class="SpellE">Japzon</span>, et al., </i>promulgated on August 5, 1985,
in denying petitioners urgent motion dated December 27, 1984 for extension of
time to file a motion for reconsideration of that Court's Resolution of
December 27, 1984 -- which had deemed said petitioners' appeal from the
judgment of the Regional Trial Court abandoned and consequently dismissed the
same; this, despite the fact that the appropriate petition for review had been
filed by the petitioners ten (10) days earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second consists in the Trial Court's ignoring the law of the
case, pronounced by the Intermediate Appellate Court with the assent of this
Court, and in characterizing an action of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>,
recognized as such by the appellate court, as an action involving a subject
matter "incapable of pecuniary estimation" and declaring it consequently
as being beyond the original jurisdiction of the municipal trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">These errors were spawned in a controversy arising from what
would appear to be nothing but a simple, straightforward transaction
consummated fourteen (14) years ago, in January, 1975.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> Spouses (herein respondents)
were the owners of a house and lot situated in <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, which they mortgaged to the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
Rural Bank to secure a loan obtained by them in the sum of P150,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They later sold the mortgaged property to the
Spouses Ramos (herein petitioners) in virtue of a “Deed of Absolute Sale With
Assumption of Mortgage” executed on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="4">April
 22, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vendees paid
the stipulated price, and, with the express consent of the mortgagee bank
evidenced by the signature of its authorized officer on the deed, assumed the
vendors' mortgage obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deed
was recorded in the Registry of Property, the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>'
title (TCT No. T-11082) was cancelled, and a new one (TCT No. T-94025) was
given to the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Ramos Spouses were however unable to obtain possession of the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their requests <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were invariably met with pleas for extension by
the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When it became apparent that the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place> intended to renege on their agreement,
the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span> referred the matter to their attorney who
sent several letters to the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>,
demanding delivery of the property, all to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The last of the letters was sent on <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">An action for illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> was
finally presented before the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>
on <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1978</st1:date>,
docketed as Case No. 226.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place> moved to dismiss the action, asserting
that the transaction of <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1977</st1:date>
was not a sale but an equitable mortgage, subject to reformation, and
consequently, the subject matter was not within the Municipal Court's
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court denied the
motion, and the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>, as plaintiffs, presented
their evidence and then rested their case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At this point, the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>
again moved to dismiss the suit, on the same ground of the Court's lack of
jurisdiction of the nature thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court also denied this second motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of presenting evidence in their defense so that the
merits of their and the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>' conflicting claims
could be determined in a single proceeding, the <span class="SpellE">Melo</span>
Spouses commenced another suit, a course of action that in retrospect is
revealed to be merely part of a stratagem to delay their delivery of the
property which they had validly sold to the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This second suit was initiated in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> on <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="2"><i>February 1, 1980</i></st1:date><i>, </i>more than two (2)
years after the institution of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit
against them in January, 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this
suit, docketed as Civil Case No. BVC-80-7, the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>
prayed for reformation of the deed of sale with assumption of mortgage, and the
inhibition of the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Municipal Court from taking
cognizance of the <span class="SpellE"><i>desahucio</i></span><i> </i>action,
Case No. 226, on the same ground earlier pleaded, that the Municipal Court had
no jurisdiction of the subject-matter thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The CFI refused to restrain the Municipal Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The refusal was set out in its Order of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1980</st1:date>, in which the Court
explicitly acknowledged the lower Court's exclusive original jurisdiction over
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit against the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place> then
filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1981</st1:date> an
action of <i>certiorari, mandamus </i>and prohibition in the Intermediate
Appellate Court, docketed as CA-G.R. No. SP-11845-SCA, assailing the denial by
the Court of First Instance of their motion to enjoin the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>
Municipal Court from proceeding with the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit, stubbornly insisting that the latter had no jurisdiction over the nature
of the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Like the Court of First Instance, the Appellate Tribunal quickly
- perceived the lack of merit in the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>'
cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It soon dismissed the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>' petition, by Resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1981</st1:date>, holding that (1) the
Municipal Court indeed had jurisdiction over the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit, and (2) it did not err in disbelieving the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>'
claim of an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
said:</p>

<blockquote>* * The Municipal Court and the respondent Court could not have
missed the fact that Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> appeal to be
educated and intelligent persons **.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
mere averment could not be the sole basis of a motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>The Municipal Court acted within its
jurisdiction and with exercise of sound discretion in proceeding to hear the
case... </i>instead of summarily dismissing it as moved by the herein
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If in every case of
forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, a mere averment to
reform the contract or title of the plaintiff is sufficient to oust the Municipal
Court of jurisdiction, the summary procedure in Rule 70 might as well be
stricken from the Rules of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * (T)here was likewise <i>no grave abuse of discretion </i>in
listening to the arguments of the private respondents (the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>)
and <i>not giving credence to those at the petitioners (the </i><span class="SpellE">Melos</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondents point out that the defense that the absolute deed of sale was
really an equitable mortgage guaranteeing the payment of loans had all the
indicia of a mere sham defense to delay and obstruct the petitioners' impending
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> from the property.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With adamantine persistence, motivated by an intent to delay the
proceedings, an intent becoming more evident with the unfolding of the relevant
events, the <span class="SpellE">Melos</span> came up to this Court to ask that the
Appellate Court's aforesaid Resolution be set aside, and their shopworn theory
of equitable mortgage upheld.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
appeal petition<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
was thrown out for lack of merit shortly after its filing, by Resolution of
this Court dated <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That resolution, of course, had the effect of
affirming the challenged resolution of the Intermediate Appellate Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By standing doctrine, the Resolution of<b> </b>the Appellate
Court of Appeals, as upheld by this Court, thus came to be <i>the law of the
case.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>**(W)hen an appellate court has once declared the law in a case,
such declaration continues to be the law of that case even on a subsequent
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule made by an appellate
court, while it maybe reversed in other cases, cannot be departed from in
subsequent proceedings in the same case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Law of the Case, as applied to a former decision of an appellate
court merely expresses the practice of the courts in refusing to reopen what
has been decided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a rule is
'necessary to enable an appellate court to perform its duties satisfactorily
and efficiently, which would be impossible if a question, once considered and
decided by it, were to be litigated anew in the same case upon any and every
subsequent appeal.' Again the rule is necessary as a matter of policy in order
to end litigation. **<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> action, Civil Case No.
226, thereafter proceeded and was duly decided on the merits on <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment vindicated the Ramos' rights
over the property and commanded the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>
and all persons deriving rights under them to vacate it and surrender it to the
Spouses Ramos.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
The <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place> appealed, not
unexpectedly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amazingly, and no doubt to the utter consternation of the Ramos
Spouses, the Court of First Instance reversed the judgment of the Court about a
month or so after its rendition (or on January 20, 1984).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Essentially, the dismissal was grounded on
the patently spacious theory that the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
action involved a subject-matter "incapable of pecuniary estimation,"
the title of the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>, as disputed by the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>, being the "epicenter of the
controversy," and hence, beyond the competence of the Municipal
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The holding is completely
inconsistent with the obvious nature of the action instituted by the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span> against the <span class="SpellE">Melos</span> as one
of <span class="SpellE"><i>desahucio</i></span><i> </i>or illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, it being in the language of the law, plainly an
action brought by vendees "against whom the possession of ** (a house and
lot) is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to
hold possession by virtue of ** (a) contract **.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> The holding flies in the teeth of
established principle, that an inferior court is not deprived of jurisdiction
over an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> action simply because the defendant
sets up a claim of ownership over the premises of which possession is sought.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> The
holding disregards, too, the law of the case declared by the Intermediate
Appellate Court in CA-G.R. No. SP-11845-SCA on <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1981</st1:date>, by virtue of which the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>'
action in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> was
categorically characterized as one of illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
within that Court's exclusive, original jurisdiction, and the Municipal Court's
conclusion of the lack of merit of the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Melos</span></st1:place>'
defense was sustained.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> This is serious error, and must be
corrected.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Ramos Spouses sought to take an appeal from the grossly
unorthodox judgment of the Court of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They however made a mistake in the choice of
the mode of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They appealed under
Rule 41 of the Rules of Court,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> instead of by petition for review
in accordance with Sec. 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 as amended by RA 5433.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a>
Fortunately, the Appellate Court opted to overlook the mistake and granted the
Ramos Spouses leave "to file the proper petition for review within fifteen
(15) days from ** (notice) after paying the required docketing fee."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a>
Unfortunately, they were able to file the petition for review only after filing
four (4) motions for extension, or more precisely, on <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without acting on the motions for extension,
and apparently without awareness that the petition for review had already been
filed on <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1984</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals, by Resolution dated <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1984</st1:date>, dismissed the Ramos Spouses' appeal on
account of their failure to timely submit their petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that very same day, <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="12">December
 27, 1984</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span> presented a <i>motion
for extension of time </i>to file a motion for reconsideration of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Apellate</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>'s resolution
dismissing their appeal, and submitted their "Very Urgent Motion for
Reconsideration" on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="1">January 15,
 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>' motion for
reconsideration was thus pending, this Court handed down its decision in the
case of <span class="SpellE"><i>Habaluyas</i></span><i> Enterprises, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Japzon</span>, </i>on <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="8">August
 5, 1985</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> in which among other things it was
held that courts should not allow extensions of the period for filing motion
for reconsideration or new trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
dictum was invoked by the <st1:street><st1:address>Appeals Court</st1:address></st1:street>
as authority to deny the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>' motion for
extension and the motion for reconsideration thereafter filed, which it did by
the Resolution of <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1985</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
now challenged in this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, and as is now generally known, this Court
decided to soften the impact of an immediate and unexpected strict application
of rule which has since come to be known as the <span class="SpellE"><i>Habaluyas</i></span><i>
doctrine.</i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By Resolution promulgated
on <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1986</st1:date>, the Court,
speaking thru Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Feria</span>, deferred strict
enforcement of the rule as follows:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>**Beginning one month after the promulgation of this Resolution,
the rule shall be strictly enforced that no motion for extension of time to
file a motion for new trial or reconsideration may be filed with the
Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Courts, the Regional Trial Courts, and the
Intermediate Appellate Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a
motion maybe filed only in cases pending with the Supreme Court as the court of
last resort, which may in its sound discretion either grant or deny the
extension requested.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Further clarification of the rule was
made on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1986</st1:date> in
<span class="SpellE"><i>Bayasa</i></span><i> v. I.A.C.,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></i></span></a><i>
</i><span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote>In other words, there is a one-month grace period from the
promulgation on May 30, 1986 of the Court's <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span>
Resolution in the <span class="SpellE">Habaluyas</span> case, or up to June 30,
1986, within which the rule barring extensions of time to file motions for new
trial or reconsideration is, as yet, not strictly enforceable.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Relief to the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span>
is thus plainly indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the Appellate Court's denial of the motion for
reconsideration of the dismissal of the petitioners' appeal was undoubtedly
correct <i>at the time, </i>having in mind the implications of the <span class="SpellE"><i>Habaluyas</i></span><i> </i>doctrine as originally announced,
the subsequent relaxation of that doctrine justifies a review of such denial,
given the fact that the petitioners' motions for extension of time (which were
not acted upon) were made during the grace period thereafter allowed and that
the petition for review was likewise filed within the extensions sought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is thus more than sufficient
justification to consider that their appeal from the judgment on the merits of
the Court of first Instance in Civil Case No. 226 had been timely perfected and
ought to have received due course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Normally, such ruling would call for a remand of the case to the Court
of Appeals for further appropriate proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, this will result only in further delay in according said
petitioners what otherwise clearly appears on the record to be so justly due
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondents presented
no evidence whatsoever in support of their claim of an alleged equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They well knew that that claim had already
been pronounced to be sham.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They chose
instead to rely again on the palpably unmeritorious defense of lack of
jurisdiction, although they were also fully aware that that defense had not
only been thrown out by the Municipal Court in Civil Case No. 226, the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, but had received equally short shrift in
the reformation case (Civil Case No. BVC-80-7) from the Court of First
Instance, and later, in review proceedings, the Intermediate Appellate Court
and this Court itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while, on the
other hand, the petitioners have duly proved their right to the possession of
the property in dispute and to a judgment in their favor in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, the private respondents by their dubious
maneuverings have managed to avoid compliance with that judgment for more than
twelve years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court makes the following dispositions. (1)
In the context of all that is shown to have transpired, the decision of the
Court of First Instance declaring the Municipal Court without jurisdiction to
hear and decide the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case is so
transparently erroneous that it cannot be allowed to stand <span class="SpellE">unreversed</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, accordingly, REVERSED. (2) The
Appellate Court's verdict sustaining the inferior court's assessment of the
private respondents' defenses as sham, is AFFIRMED, and the disputed
transaction between the petitioners and the private respondents is hereby
DECLARED a true and proper sale that vested in the former not only title but
also the right to the possession of the property subject thereof. (3) That
right was appropriately litigated and properly vindicated in the judgment of
the Municipal Court in Civil Case No. 226, and said judgment is therefore
AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs
