<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the trial court and quoted by the Court of
Appeals are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence for the prosecution shows that on <st1:date year="1982" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1982</st1:date>, between <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 to 4:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, June
Navarette was driving a Mitsubishi Lancer, owned by Linda Navarette, her
sister, along <st1:street><st1:address>MacArthur Highway</st1:address></st1:street>
in Bo. Mamatitang, travelling towards the general direction of Manila on board
the Lancer car were Linda Navarette, Legionaria Panopio, Mae Custodio, Noel
Reynaldo Navarette, Raymond Asprer (aged 6 years), Antonette Asprer (aged 4
years), and Mercy Panopio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noel Reynaldo
Navarette and Raymond Asprer were seated on the front seat at the right side of
the driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Linda and the rest of the
passengers were all seated at the back seat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Lancer car was then cruising steadily at the right lane of the
road in Bo. Mamatitang, Mabalacat, Pampanga at a rate <span style="">of </span>speed of about forty kilometers per hour (40 kph), southbound
for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other vehicle was preceding the Lancer
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, however, the Philippine
Rabbit bus driven by accused Eustaquio <span style="">Mayo,
</span>Jr. trailing closely behind the Lancer car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Behind the Philippine Rabbit bus was a
Tamaraw jeep driven by Danilo Miranda Concepcion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As the vehicles approached the vicinity of Mabalacat Institute, the
Rabbit bus picked up speed and swerved to the left lane to overtake the Lancer
car which was running <span style="">on </span>the
right lane of the highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
Rabbit bus was abreast with the Lancer, an oncoming vehicle from the opposite
direction appeared and flashed its headlights to warn the Rabbit bus to give
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rabbit bus swerved to its right
in an effort <span style="">to </span>return to the
right lane to avoid collision with the oncoming vehicle, and in the process it
hit and bumped the left rear side portion of the Lancer car with its right
front bumper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the impact the
driver of the Lancer car lost control of the wheel and the car swerved across
to the left and hit Narciso Yandan, a bystander, and thereafter crashed against
the concrete fence of Mr. Bernie Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>It was established that before the accident took place, the Tamaraw
jeep was first ahead, followed by the Lancer car, and behind the Lancer car was
the Rabbit bus, travelling towards the direction of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Lancer car as well as the Rabbit bus
following one after the other overtook the Tamaraw jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rabbit bus, still trailing behind the
Lancer car, then tried to overtake the Lancer car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when the Rabbit bus, was abreast with the
Lancer car, there was an oncoming vehicle approaching and signalling through
the flash of its headlights from the opposite direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rabbit bus, to avoid a head-on collision
with the vehicle, tried to get back to its lane to the right, and in the
process it bumped the left rear portion of the Lancer car (Exhibit 'H-1-A'),
which was then cruising on the right lane of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus because of the impact, precipitated by
the reckless imprudence of the accused, a chain reaction occurred; the driver
of the Lancer car lost control of the wheel and the car swerved to the left and
darted across the road, hitting thereat Narciso Yandan, a pedestrian, and
stopped only when it crashed against the concrete fence of Mr. Bernie Reyes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Lancer car was heavily damaged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was almost a total wreck; the passengers, including the driver,
sustained physical injuries in varying degrees.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court's decision was affirmed with
the modification that the appellant suffer <span style="">a </span>straight penalty of three months which was recommended by the

the Indeterminate Sentence Law is not applicable in the instant case, the

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was denied for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1991" day="22" month="4">April
 22, 1991</st1:date>, we gave due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, the instant petition is <span style="">limited to </span>the moral damages in the
amount of P700,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Initially, the
petitioner alleged the amount of P1,000,000.00 as moral damages awarded to <span style="">Linda </span>Navarette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount was later clarified to be

<p class="BODY">The petitioner summarizes its objections to the award of moral
damages in favor of Linda Navarette <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals gravely abused its
discretion and seriously erred in awarding moral damages to the private
complainant without citing the factual basis for such an award and without
giving the justification for granting such an arbitrary and exorbitant amount
of over One Million Pesos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals gravely abused its
discretion and seriously erred in awarding an exorbitant amount of One Million
Pesos to complainant Linda Navarette by way of moral damages despite the fact
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) the complainant had placed a
value of only P500,000.00 for her mental, psychological and moral sufferings,
and b) the complainant's claim for moral damages for the loss of her boyfriend
in the amount of P1,000,000.00 can have no legal or factual basis."

<p class="BODY">As alleged by the petitioner, the Court of Appeals did <span style="">not </span>discuss specific factual
circumstances which <span style="">would </span>justify
the award of moral damages in favor of Navarette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the appellate court in general terms
stated that:</p>

<blockquote>“The Court has gone over decision <span style="">appealed from and finds it replete with facts, with the details, the
anguish, the </span><span style="">fright, </span><span style="">the anxieties, the shock and loss, that the
victims had gone through and suffered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to legal provisions, the law is specific concerning the award of
moral damages x </span><span style="">x </span><span style="">x." (Rollo, p. 46)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court then cited the provisions of the Civil Code,
specifically Articles 2217 and 2219 to justify the legal basis for the award of
moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then concluded that
"The record shows ample proof introduced in support of the award of
damages in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is
satisfied that the amount of award is not excessive and is in accord with the
law and the facts of <span style="">the </span>case."

propriety of the award of moral damages <span style="">in

the right eyeball; that it cannot be saved and there is a necessity of
artificial eye placement on the socket.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">The foregoing findings form the only basis for the award of moral
damages in favor of Linda Navarette.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These were adopted by the appellate court in affirming the trial court's
decision as regards the award of moral damages in favor of Linda Navarette.</p>

<p class="BODY">The vital question now is whether or not the said findings of the
trial court justify the award of moral damages in the amount of P700,000.00 in
favor of complainant Linda Navarette.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that moral damages include physical
suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation,
wounded feelings, moral shock, <span style="">social </span>humiliation
and similar injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though incapable of
pecuniary computation, moral damages <span style="">may
</span>be recovered if they are the proximate result of the defendant's
wrongful act or omission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 2217,
New Civil Code; People v. Baylon, 129 SCRA 62 [1984]; Prudenciado v. Alliance
Transport System, Inc., 148 SCRA 440 [1987]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, Article 2219 of the New Civil Code provides that:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 2219.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moral damages may
be recovered in the following and analogous cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A criminal offense resulting in physical
injuries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quasi-delicto causing physical injuries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seduction, abduction, rape or other
lascivious acts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adultery or concubinage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(9)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acts and actions referred to in articles 21,

<p class="BODY">We agree that complainant Linda Navarette is entitled to moral
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She suffered injuries as a
result of the criminal offense of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, her injuries resulting in a
permanent scar at her forehead and the loss of her right eye undoubtedly gave
her mental anguish, wounded feelings and shock.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The psychological effect on her as regards the scar on her forehead and
her false eye must have devastated her considering that women in general are
fastidious on how they <span style="">look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">More important, however, was <span style="">the </span>loss of vision of her right eye which was severely injured
as a result of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
accident, Linda Navarette had to contend <span style="">with
</span>the loss of her eyesight on her right eye which necessarily hampers her
not only physically but also professionally for the rest of her life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the accident, Linda Navarette who is a
home economist by profession was doing well in her career.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A graduate of the University of the
Philippines with the degree of Home Economics, she is the Assistant-Vice
President as well as Resident Manager of Club Solviento receiving a gross
income of P10,000.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simultaneously with her work at Club Solviento, she served as Food Consultant
of Food City where she received a monthly salary of P7,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She, however, had to give up her consultancy
job after the accident not only because of her prolonged absences but because
of the physical handicap she suffered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, we find no justification to award moral damages in
favor of Linda Navarette for the loss of her boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, the loss of her boyfriend after the
accident added to her mental and emotional sufferings and psychologically
affected and disturbed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
there is no clear evidence <span style="">on </span>record
to show that her boyfriend left her after the accident due <span style="">to </span>her physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may have left her even if she did not
suffer the slightest injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons
for the break-up of a courtship are too many and too complicated such that they
should not form the basis of damages arising from a vehicular accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, granting that her boyfriend left
her due to her physical injuries, we still find no legal basis for the award of
moral damages in <span style="">favor </span>of
complainant Navarette because of the loss of a boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2719 of the New Civil Code quoted
earlier enumerates cases wherein moral damages may be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Loss of a boyfriend as a result of physical
injuries suffered after an accident is not one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can it be categorized as an <u><span style="">analogous</span></u><span style=""> </span>case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing findings we now resolve the issue as regards
the amount of moral damages to which Linda Navarette is entitled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The well-entrenched principle is that moral damages depend upon
the discretion of the trial courts based on the facts and circumstances of each
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Prudenciado v. Alliance Transport
System, <u><span style="">supra;</span></u><span style=""> </span>Pleno v. Court of Appeals, 161 SCRA
208 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This discretion is,
however, conditioned in that the "amount awarded should not <span style="">be </span>palpably and scandalously
excessive" <span style="">so </span>as to
indicate that it was the result of prejudice or corruption on the part of the
trial court." (Gellada v. Warner Barnes &amp; Co., Inc., 57 O.G. [4] 7347,
7358; Sadie v. Bachrach Motors Co., Inc<span style="">.
</span>57 O.G. [4] 636; Prudenciado v. Alliance Transport System, Inc. <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">; </span>Pleno v. Court of Appeals, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">; </span>Siguenza
v. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 570 [1985]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In determining the amount of moral damages, the actual losses sustained
by the aggrieved party and the gravity of the injuries must be considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Pleno v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>;
Prudenciado v. Alliance Transport System, Inc. <u>supra</u>; Siguenza v. Court
of Appeals, <u>supra</u>) Finally, "moral damages are emphatically not
intended to enrich a<span style=""> complainant at the
expense of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
awarded only to enable the injured party to obtain means, diversion or
amusements that will serve to alleviate the moral suffering he has undergone,
by reason of the defendant's culpable action." (R &amp; B Surety &amp;
Insurance Co., Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 129 SCRA 736 [1984];
citing Grand Union Super</span>market, Inc. v. Espino, Jr., 94 SCRA 953 [1979],
cited in Prudenciado v. Alliance Transport System, Inc. <u>supra</u>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Applying these principles
in the instant case, we rule that the award of P700,000.00 as moral damages in
favor of complainant Linda Navarette is unconscionable and excessive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rejected Navarette's claim for the amount
of P1,000,000.00 as moral damages for the loss of her boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note that she asked for the amount of
P500,000.00 as moral damages due to her personal injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the award for moral damages should
not exceed the amount of P500,000.00 (Makabali v. Court of Appeals, 157 SCRA
253 [1988])<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule that under the
circumstances of the instant case, the amount of P200,000.00 as moral damages
in favor of complainant Linda Navarette is reasonable, just and fair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">One final consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1991" day="25" month="9"><span style="">September
 25, 1991</span></st1:date><span style="">, we
required Atty. Evelyn Balgos-Guballa of the Acosta and </span>Rico Law Offices,
counsel for the private respondent, to show cause why disciplinary action
should not be taken against her for failure to file the required memorandum
within the extended period which expired on <st1:date year="1991" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1991</st1:date> within ten days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her “COMPLIANCE", Atty. Evelyn Balgos-Guballa stated that
she finished the draft of the memorandum as early as the first week of July and
submitted it to the partner-in-charge, Atty. Rex G. Rico; that it was only
recently, that she discovered that the memorandum was inadvertently inserted by
one of their secretaries (while fixing the table of Atty. Rex G. Rico) among
the files of other cases of the law firm; that this unfortunate incident
precluded the partner-in-charge to review, correct or modify the draft of the
memorandum; and that after discovery of the incident they immediately finalized
and filed the memorandum on October 8, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the explanation of Atty. Balgos-Guballa
unsatisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law firm should have
adopted a more systematic procedure to handle pleadings required to be filed in
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the
memorandum was due on <st1:date year="1991" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1991</st1:date>
yet and it would seem that the law firm, if believed, discovered the
secretary’s blunder two (2) months or more thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such inaction on the part of the law firm,
specifically Atty. Rico and Atty. Balgos-Guballa to check whether or not the
required memorandum has been filed with the Court within the reglementary
period is equivalent to gross negligence on their part to comply with the directive
of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is partly GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned decision of the Court of
Appeals is MODIFIED in that the amount of P700,000.00 as moral damages granted
to complainant Linda Navarette is reduced to P200,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Rex G. Rico and Atty. Evelyn Balgos-Guballa are hereby
REPRIMANDED for non-compliance with the Resolution dated <st1:date year="1991" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1991</st1:date> with the warning that further
gross negligence of this nature committed by them would be dealt with more
severely.</p>
