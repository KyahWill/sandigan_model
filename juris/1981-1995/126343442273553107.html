Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 May 1973, the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch
XXII, promulgated a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>the dispositive portion of which reads

taxes paid by it for the parcel of land covered by Presidential Proclamation
No. 430 of August 10, 1939, and the warehouse erected thereon from and after
October 25, 1966, with interests thereon at the legal rate from the date <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the filing of the complaint and the
costs of the suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals which however
certified the case to Us as one involving pure questions of law, pursuant to
Sec. 17, R.A. 296.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, CEBU assigns five (5) errors<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
imputed to the trial court which may be synopsized into whether NDC is exempt
from payment of real estate taxes on the land reserved by the President for
warehousing purposes as well as the warehouse constructed thereon, and in the
affirmative, whether NDC may recover in refund unprotested real estate taxes it
paid from 1948 to 1970.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first question, CEBU insists on taxability of the subject
properties, claiming that no law grants NDC exemption from real estate taxes,
and that NDC, as recipient of the land reserved by the President pursuant to
Sec. 83 of the Public Land Act,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> is
liable for payment of ordinary (real estate) taxes under Sec. 115 thereof.  CEBU contends that the properties have
ceased to be tax exempt under the Assessment Law<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> when
the government disposed of them in favor of NDC, and even assuming that title
to the land remains with the government (ownership being the basis for real
estate taxability under the Assessment Law), the Supreme Court rulings
establish increasing trend in the application of "use" of property
rather than "ownership" as basis for real estate tax liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, NDC maintains that Sec. 3 of the Assessment
Law, which exempts properties owned by the Republic from real estate tax,
includes subject properties in the exemption.  It invokes the ruling in <i>Board of Assessment Appeals </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">vs. </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">CTA &amp; NWS</span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">A</span></i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>which held that properties of NWSA, a
GOCC, were exempt from real estate tax because Sec. 3 of the Assessment Law
applied to all government properties whether held in governmental or
proprietary capacity.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">NDC </span>rejects the applicability of Sec.
115 of the Public Land Act to the subject land, claiming that that provision
contemplates dispositions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>public
land with eventual transfer of title.  In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">addition, </span>NDC believes
that it is neither a grantee of a public land nor an applicant within the
purview of the same provision.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As already adverted to, one of the principal issues before Us is
the interpretation of a provision of the Assessment Law, the precursor of the
then Real Property Tax Code and the Local Government <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">C</span>ode, where "ownership" of the property and not
"use" is the test of tax liability<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Section 3, par. (a), of the Assessment Law, on which NDC claims
real estate tax exemption, provides –</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 3.  <i>Property
exempt from tax.  – </i>The exemptions
shall be as follows:  (a) Property owned
by the United States of America, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, any
province, city, municipality or municipal district x x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same opinion of NDC was passed upon in <i>National
Development Co. v. Province of Nueva Ecija</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><i> </i>where
We held that its properties were not comprehended in Sec. 3, par. (a), of the
Assessment Law.  In part, We stated:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Commonwealth Act No. 182 which created NDC
contains no provision exempting it from the payment of real estate tax on
properties it may acquire x x x x There is justification in the contention of
plaintiff-appellee that x x x x [I]t is undeniable that to any municipality the
principal source of revenue with which it would defray its operation will come
from real property taxes.  If the National
Development Company would be exempt from paying real property taxes over these
properties, the town of Gabaldon will be deprived of much needed revenues with
which it will maintain itself and finance the compelling needs of its
inhabitants (p. 6, Brief of Plaintiff-Appellee).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-appellant NDC does not come under
the classification of municipal or public corporation in the sense that it may
sue and be sued in the same manner as any other private corporations, and in
this sense, it is an entity different from the government.  Unlike the government, defendant corporation
may be sued without its consent, and is subject to taxation.  In the case of NDC vs. Jose Yulo Tobias, 7
SCRA 692, it was held that ‘x x x plaintiff is neither the Government of the
Republic nor a branch or subdivision thereof, but a government owned and
controlled corporation which cannot be said to exercise a sovereign function
(Associacion Cooperativa de Credito Agricola de Miagao vs. Monteclaro, 74 Phil.
281), it is a business corporation, and as such, its causes of action are
subject to the statute of limitations.  x x x That plaintiff herein does not exercise sovereign powers – and,
hence, cannot invoke the exemptions thereof – but is an agency for the
performance of purely corporate, proprietary or business functions, is apparent
from its Organic Act (Commonwealth Act 182, as amended by Commonwealth Act 311)
pursuant to Section 3 of which it ‘shall be subject to the provisions of the
Corporation Law insofar as they are not inconsistent’ with the provisions of
said Commonwealth Act, ‘and shall have the general powers mentioned in said’
Corporation Law, and, hence, ‘may engage in commercial, industrial, mining,
agricultural, and other enterprises which may be necessary or contributory to
the economic development of the country, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or
</span>important in the public interest’, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as
</span>well as ‘acquire, hold, mortgage, and alienate personal and real
property in the Philippines or elsewhere; x x x make contracts of any kind and
description’, and ‘perform any and all acts which a corporation or natural
persons is authorized to perform under the laws now existing or which may be
enacted hereafter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no compelling reason why the foregoing ruling, although
referring to lands which would eventually be transferred to private
individuals, should not apply equally to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">NDC cites <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Board of
Assessment Appeals, Province of Laguna v. Court of Tax Appeals and National
Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NWSA).  </span></i>In that case, We held that properties of NWSA, a GOCC, were
exempt from real estate tax because Sec. 3, par. (c), of R.A., 470 did not
distinguish between those possessed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">by </span>the
government in sovereign/governmental/political capacity and those in
private/proprietary/patrimonial character.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conflict between <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">NDC
v. Nueva Ecija, supra, </span></i>and <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">BAA
</span>v. </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">CTA and NWSA, supra, </span></i>is
more superficial than real.  The <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">NDC </span></i>decision speaks of properties
owned by NDC, while the <i>BAA</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span></i>ruling
concerns properties belonging <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">to </span>the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Republic.  </span>The latter case appears <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">to </span>be exceptional because the parties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">therein </span>stipulated –</p>

<blockquote>"1. That the
petitioner National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) is a public
corporation created by virtue of Republic Act No. 1383, and that <u>it is owned
by the Government of the Philippines as well as all property comprising
waterworks and sewerage systems placed under it</u>" (<i>underscoring
supplied</i>).<i><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There, the Court observed:  "It is conceded, in the stipulation of facts, that the property involved
in this case ‘is owned by the Government of the Philippines.’  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Hence,
it belongs to the Republic of the Philippines and falls squarely within the
letter of the above provision."</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, no
similar statement appears in the stipulation of facts, hence, ownership of
subject properties should first be established.  For, while it may be stated that the Republic owns NDC, it does
not necessarily follow that properties owned by NDC are also owned by the Republic
– in the same way that stockholders are not <i>ipso </i></span><i>facto </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">owners of the properties </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of their corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Republic, like any
individual, may form a corporation with personality and existence distinct from
its own.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">The separate personality </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allows
a GOCC to hold and possess properties in its own name and, thus, permit greater
independence and flexibility in its operations.  It may, therefore, be stated that tax exemption of "property
owned by the Republic of the Philippines" refers to properties owned by
the Government and by its agencies which do not have separate and distinct
personalities (unincorporated entities).   We find the separate opinion </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of Justice Bautista-Angelo in </span><i>Gonzales v. Hechanova, et </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">al.,</span></i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> appropriate and enlightening -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">x </span></i>The
Government of the Republic of the Philippines under the Revised Administrative
Code refers to that entity through which the functions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

political authority is made effective whether they be provincial, municipal or
other form of local government, whereas a government instrumentality refers to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">corporations owned or controlled by the
government to promote certain aspects of the economic life </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">our people.  A government agency, therefore, must necessarily refer to the government
itself of the </span>Republic, as distinguished from any government
instrumentality which has a personality distinct and separate from it (Section
2)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussion does not mean that because NDC, like
most GOCC's, engages in commercial enterprises all properties of the government
and its unincorporated agencies possessed in proprietary character are
taxable.  Similarly, in the case at bar,
NDC proceeded on the premise that the <i>BAA </i>ruling declared all properties
owned by GOCC's as properties in the name of the Republic, hence, exempt under
Sec. 3 of the Assessment Law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To come within the ambit of the exemption provided in Art. 3,
par. (a), of the Assessment Law, it is important to establish that the property
is owned by the government or by its unincorporated agency, and once government
ownership is determined, the nature of the use of the property, whether for
proprietary or sovereign purposes, becomes immaterial.  What appears to have been ceded to NWC
(later transferred to NDC), in the case before Us, is merely the administration
of the property while the government retains ownership of what has been
declared reserved for warehousing purposes under Proclamation No. 430.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, the parties never raised the issue of ownership
from the court <i>a quo </i>to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reserved land is defined as a "[p]ublic land that has been
withheld or kept back from sale or disposition.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> The

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
it merely means "a withdrawal of a specified portion of the public domain

As its title remains with the Republic, the reserved land is clearly covered by
the tax exemption provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">CEBU nevertheless contends that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">t</span>he reservation of the property in favor of NWC or NDC is a form
of disposition of public land which subjects the recipient (NDC) to real estate
taxation under Sec. 115 of the Public Land Act, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">as </span>amended by R.A. 436,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 115.  All lands
granted by virtue of this Act, including homesteads upon which final proof has
not been made or approved shall, even though and while the title remains in the
State, be subject to the ordinary taxes, which shall be paid by the grantee or
the applicant, beginning with the year next following the one in which the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">concession has </span>been approved, or the
contract has been signed, as the case may be, on the basis of the value fixed
in such filing, approval or signing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of<i>
</i></span>the application, concession or contract."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The essential question then is whether lands reserved pursuant to
Sec. 83 are comprehended in Sec. 115 and, therefore, taxable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 115 of the Public Land Act should be treated as an
exception to Art. 3, par. (a), of the Assessment Law.  While ordinarily public lands are tax exempt because title
thereto belongs to the Republic, Sec. 115 subjects them to real estate tax even
before ownership thereto is transferred in the name of the beneficiaries.  Sec. 115 comprehends three (3) modes of
disposition of lands under the Public Land Act, to wit:  homestead, concession, and contract.</p>

Sec. 115 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is predicated on (a) <i>filing
</i>of homestead application, (b) <i>approval </i>of concession and, (c) <i>signing
</i></span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">contract.  Significantly, without these qualifying
words, the date </span>of the accrual of the real estate tax would be
indeterminate.  Since NDC is not a
homesteader and no "contract" (bilateral agreement) was signed, it
would appear, then, that reservation under Sec. 83, being a unilateral act of
the President, falls under "concession".</p>

<p class="BODY">"Concession" as a technical term under the Public Land
Act is synonymous with "alienation” and "disposition", and is
defined in Sec. 10 as "any of the methods authorized by this Act for the
acquisition, lease, use, or benefit of the lands of the public domain other
than timber or mineral lands." Logically, where Sec. 115 contemplates
authorized methods for acquisition, lease, use, or benefit under the Act, the
taxability of the land would depend on whether reservation under Sec. 83 is one
such method of acquisition, etc.  Tersely put, is reservation synonymous with alienation? Or, are the two
terms antithetical and mutually exclusive? Indeed, reservation connotes
retention, while concession (alienation) signifies cession.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sections 8 and 88 of the Public Land Act provide that reserved
lands are excluded from that mass of public land that may be subject of
disposition, to wit –</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 8.  Only those
lands shall be declared open to disposition or concession which have been
officially delimited and classified and, when practicable, surveyed, and <u>which
have not been reserved</u> for public or quasi-public uses, nor appropriated by
the Government, nor in any manner become private property, nor those on which a
private right authorized and recognized by this Act or any valid law may be
claimed, or <u>which, having been reserved or appropriated, have ceased to be
so</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 88.  The tract or
tracts of land reserved under the provisions of section eighty-three shall be <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">non-alienable and shall not be subject to
occupation, entry, sale, lease, or other disposition until again declared
alienable</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>under the
provisions of this Act or by proclamation of the President" (<i>underscoring
supplied</i>).<i><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As We view it, the effect of reservation under Sec. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">83 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is to segregate a piece of public land </span>and transform it into <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">non-alienable</span> or<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>non-disposable under the Public Land <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Act.  </span>Section

Clearly, therefore, Sec. 115 does not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">apply </span>to lands reserved under Sec. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">83.  Consequently, the subject reserved public land remains tax exempt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, as regards the warehouse constructed on a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>public reservation, a different rule
should apply because "[t]he exemption of public property from taxation
does not extend to improvements on the public lands made by pre-emptioners,
homesteaders and other claimants, or occupants, at their own expense, and these
are taxable by the state x x x x"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the warehouse constructed on the reserved land by NWC (now under administration
by NDC), indeed, should properly be assessed real estate tax as such
improvement does not appear to belong to the Republic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the reservation is exempt from realty tax, the erroneous
tax payments collected by CEBU should be refunded to NDC.  This is in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">consonance </span>with Sec. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">40,
</span>par. (a) of the former Real Property Tax Code which exempted from

political subdivisions, as well as any GOCC so exempt by its charter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">As regards the requirement of paying under protest before
judicial recourse, CEBU argues that in any case NDC is not entitled to refund
because Sec. 75 of R.A. 3857, the Revised Charter of the City of Cebu,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

requires payment <u>under</u> <u>protest</u> before resorting to judicial
action for tax refund; that it could not have acted on the first demand letter
of NDC of 20 May 1970 because it was sent to the City Assessor and not to the
City Treasurer; that, consequently, there having been no appropriate prior
demand, resort to judicial remedy is premature; and, that even on the premise
that there was proper demand, NDC has yet to exhaust administrative remedies by
way of appeal to the Department of Finance and/or Auditor General before taking
judicial action.</p>

<p class="BODY">NDC does not agree.  It
disputes the applicability of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">payment-</span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">under-protest </span></i>requirement provided

We held in <i>Province of Nueva Ecija v. Imperial Mining Company, Inc., </i>G.R.
No. L-59463, prom. 19 November 1982, 118 SCRA 632:  “When IMC in 1968 obtained lease on the mineral land in question,
the law governing real property taxation was the former Assessment Law,
Commonwealth Act 470, and the basis of realty taxation thereunder was <i>ownership
</i>or interest tantamount to ownership.  A mere lessee of mineral land was therefore <i>not liable </i>for the
payment of realty tax thereon x <i>x </i>x x.  In 1974, a new Real Property Tax Code came into being when Presidential
Decree 464 was issued.  It changed the
basis of real property taxation.  It
adopted the policy of taxing real property on the basis of <i>actual use, even
if the user is not the owner</i>.”</p>

Consequently, erroneous reliance by <i>NWSA v. Quezon City, </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">B.R. </span>No. L-25310, 26 April 1968, 23
SCRA 286, and <i>Social Security System v. City of Bacolod </i>G.R. No. L-35726,
21 July 1982, 115 SCRA 412, on <i>BAA v. CTA and NWSA, </i>should be
reexamined.  In <i>NWSA v. Quezon City, </i>We
held:  “x x x x The properties of NWSA
are exempt from <i>realty tax </i>as properties of the Republic of the
Philippines under Sec. 47 (a) of Republic Act 537 (Revised Charter of Quezon
City) x x x x" </p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">In <i>SSS v. City of Bacolod, </i>We
ruled:  “What is decisive is that the
properties possessed by the SSS, albeit devoted to private or proprietary
purpose, are in fact owned by the government of the Philippines.  As such they are exempt from realty taxes x
x x x"</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">The SSS case appears to have
proceeded from the premise that properties of SSS are <i>ipso facto </i>owned
by the Republic.  In fact, it views Sec.
16 of P.D. 24 exempting SSS and its assets from taxation a confirmation of its
ruling.  We are not persuaded; P.D. 24
speaks of properties owned by SSS, while the decision alludes to properties
owned by the Republic.  That conclusion
is a misapplication of the <i>BAA </i>ruling.</p>
