were scheduled to leave the country on board Flight CX900 of the Cathay Pacific 
Airways for <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, confidential information that 
five or six Japanese departing via said flight would be bringing out a huge 
amount of foreign currencies was transmitted by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Dayao</span>, Acting Chief, 
Administrative Services Division, Bureau of Customs to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> O. Bautista, Officer-in-Charge, MIA Flight Departure

instructed Customs Examiners Josefina <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Versoza</span> to conduct a rigid and thorough search 
of passengers checking in for said Flight CX900.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, when

Josefina <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, through Masayoshi <span class="SpellE">Iwama</span>, who could understand and speak English, if they were 
carrying dollars.<span>&nbsp; </span>All answered in the negative.<span>&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioners were questioned as to the source of the 
currencies by a certain Major <span class="SpellE">Amistoso</span>, Chief of 
Operations and Control, Intelligence Division, Philippine Air Force.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>All said 
"<st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>".<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They were asked if they had any permit or authorization from the Central 
Bank of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> to 
<span>bring </span>out the foreign currencies, but they could not produce 
any.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, the foreign currencies were seized for a violation of 
Section 3 of Central Bank Circular No. 265, in relation to Section 2530 par. [f] 
<span class="GramE">of</span> the Revised Tariff and Customs Code; and Seizure 
Identification No. MIA-1350-76 against said monies was instituted.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners were eventually allowed to leave the country as no 
criminal charges were filed against them, the reason being that:</p>
<blockquote>"1. The government had insufficient evidence on how the foreign 
currencies were obtained locally; and,</blockquote>
<blockquote>"2<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>For</span> want of a legal basis 
because Section 6 of CB Circular No. 265 [penal sanction] refers only to 
resident persons." (p. 27, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In the meantime, several hearings were conducted in Seizure 
Identification No. <span class="GramE">MIA-1350-76, where petitioners as claimants 
were duly represented by counsel.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="3" day="16" year="1976">March 16, 1976</st1:date>, the Collector of Customs, 
Airport <span class="SpellE">Customshouse</span> rendered a decision, declaring 
the seized foreign currencies forfeited in favor of the government.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioners appealed said decision to the Commissioner of Customs, who 
affirmed the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their motion for reconsideration having been 
denied, petitioners elevated the case to the respondent Court of Tax Appeals 
[CTA].<span>&nbsp; </span>The appeal, docketed as CTA Case No. 2902, was likewise 
decided against petitioners, with respondent CTA affirming the decision of the 
Commissioner of Customs on <st1:date month="4" day="23" year="1979">April 23,

</span>However, on <st1:date month="11" day="11" year="1981">November 11,

parties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which were either noted or 
denied.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Shortly before the 1986 Christmas 
recess, the Second Division resolved to refer the case at bar to the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">en</span> <em>banc</em>.</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners contest the forfeiture of the foreign currencies found 
in their persons and possession on two grounds, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>1] the 
alleged repeal of par. 3 of CB Circular No. 265, upon which the forfeiture was 
based, by CB Circular Nos. 270 and 534; and, 2] the supposed failure on the part 
of the government to show by competent proof the source of the subject foreign 
currencies to be the Philippines, <span class="SpellE"><em>vis-a-vis</em></span> 
petitioners' claim that the same were brought in by them from Japan.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioners further charge the <span>res</span>pondent CTA with grave 
abuse of discretion in having denied their motion for reconsideration and/or for 
new trial.</p>
<p class="BODY">A review of the various circulars passed by the Central Bank of 
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
during the period under consideration belies petitioners' first contention. 
<span>&nbsp;</span>C.B. Circular No. 265 was issued on November 20, 1968.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Paragraph 3 thereof provided that "No person shall take out or export 
from the Philippines foreign currency or any foreign exchange except as 
otherwise authorized by law" while paragraph 6 enjoined strict observance of the 
provisions of said Circular and subjected to the penal sanctions of Section 34 
of the Central Bank Law "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> any resident person, firm or corporation who being bound 
to the observance thereof <span>x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall fail or refuse to comply with, or abide by, or shall 
violate the same x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Its</span> implementing rules and regulations 
were embodied in CB Circular No. 266, issued by the Central Bank six [6] days 
later on <st1:date month="11" day="26" year="1968">November 26, 
1968</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Among its salient provisions were the 
following:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>[a] Every 
Philippine resident departing from or returning to the Philippines from abroad 
and every temporary visitor entering the Philippines, including members of the

Customs and other competent authorities in searching <span>the person and 
luggage of the suspect, and the Philippine currency and/or foreign exchange 
</span>involved shall<span>&nbsp; </span>be treated as provided by law."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="4" day="16" year="1969">April 16, 
1969</st1:date>, however, the Central Bank issued Circular No. 270, revoking 
Circular No. 266<em> in toto</em>, and further directing that "hence-forth, no 
currency declaration of any kind shall be required either from outgoing or 
incoming passengers."</p>
<p class="BODY">Another circular, Circular No. 534 was issued on <st1:date month="7" day="19" year="1976">July 19, 1976</st1:date>, which provided:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 3.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Unless specifically 
authorized by the Central Bank or allowed under existing international agreement 
or Central Bank regulations, no person shall take or transmit or attempt to take 
or transmit foreign exchange in any form, out of the <span>Philippines, 
directly, through other person, through the mails or through international 
carriers.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"The provision of this Section shall not apply to tourist and 
non-resident temporary visitors who are taking or sending out of <span>the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
their own foreign exchange brought in by them."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The incident at bar occurred on January 11, 1976, at which time 
C.B. Circular No. 265 was still in full force and effect.<span>&nbsp; </span>Circular 
No. 270, issued on <st1:date month="4" day="16" year="1969">April 16, 
1969</st1:date>, did not repeal C.B. Circular No. 265, but merely its 
implementing rules and regulations, known as Circular No. 266.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
prohibition to "take out or export from the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
foreign currency or any foreign exchange except as otherwise authorized by law" 
still stood; only the cumbersome requirement of currency declaration was done 
away with.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, the failure of petitioners to present any permit 
or authorization from the Central Bank to take out the foreign currencies found 
in their possession, created a <em>prima facie</em> case for their seizure and 
confiscation in accordance with Section 3 of C.B. Circular No. 265, in relation 
to Section 2530 of the Revised Tariff and Customs Code which provides:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 2530.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Property

</span>used as instruments in the importation or exportation of the

<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">Evidently, petitioners cannot avail 
themselves of Circular No. 534, as said Circular was issued only on <st1:date month="7" day="19" year="1976">July 19, 1976</st1:date>, or six months after the 
incident at bar.</p>
<p class="BODY">Even supposing that Circular No. 534 could apply to the present 
case, the result obtained will not be any different, for the provision relied 
upon by petitioners that "the provision of this Section shall not apply to 
tourist or non-resident temporary visitors who are taking or sending out of the 
Philippines their own foreign exchange brought in by them" does not dispense 
with the requirement of said <span>tourist </span>or non-resident temporary 
visitor having to show by competent proof that he is merely bringing out 
whatever foreign exchange he previously brought into the country.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>And this brings <span class="GramE">Us</span> to the second posture taken 
by petitioners.</p>
<p class="BODY">It must be emphasized that petitioners, although physically 
absent, were duly represented by counsel at all stages of the seizure 
proceedings.<span>&nbsp; </span>They had therefore all the opportunity to present 
sufficient evidence to substantiate their bare allegation that the foreign 
currencies came from their country of origin.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, reliance 
was placed solely on the statement given by petitioners to Major <span class="SpellE">Amistoso</span> that the currencies in question came from 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, such information could not be accorded any evidentiary weight as 
the testimony of said Major <span class="SpellE">Amistoso</span> to this effect at 
the seizure proceedings was, as correctly ruled by the Collector of Customs in 
his decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> in the nature of hearsay 
evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, up to the time the case was pending before the 
respondent Court of Tax Appeals, petitioners, as claimants, had not successfully 
discharged the onus laid on them by Section 2535 of the Tariff and Customs Code 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec.<span> </span>2535.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">Burden of Proof in Seizure and/or Forfeiture.</span> — 
In all proceedings taken for the seizure and/or forfeiture of any vehicle, 
vessel, aircraft, beast or articles under the provisions <span>of the tariff and 
customs laws, the burden of proof shall lie upon the claimant; Provided, That 
probable cause shall first be shown for the </span>institution of such 
proceedings and that seizure and/or forfeiture <span>was made under the 
circumstances and in the manner described in the </span>preceding sections of 
this Code."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">It was only after the respondent court of Tax Appeals had decided 
the appeal against petitioners that the latter, in a motion for reconsideration 
and/or new trial, attempted to accomplish this task through the submission of 
documents purporting to show that the sum of US$104,000.00 was purchased by 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kaneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sotoyama</span> on 
December 15, 1975 from a company named <span class="SpellE">Nangoku</span> <span class="SpellE">Shokuhin</span> Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, later changed to <span class="SpellE">Chikusan</span> <span class="SpellE">Jigyo</span> Kaihatsu Kabushiki 
Kaisha.<span>&nbsp; </span>But by petitioners' own admission, said documents could 
hardly be considered newly-discovered evidence as would warrant a new trial 
under Sec. 1[b] of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thus, in denying petitioners' motion, the 
respondent Court of Tax Appeals said:</p>
<blockquote>"2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anent the matter of new trial, petitioners 
alleged that the documents [Annexes 'A', 'A-1', 'B' and 'B-1', supplemental 
motion, pp. 87-93, CTA records] which they would like to introduce as evidence 
would prove that the subject foreign <span>currencies were purchased by them in 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.</span><o:p></o:p>"Really, 
the presentation and admission of such documents will not alter nor affect the 
result of this case because of our findings and conclusion that when petitioners 
were taking out of the Philippines the subject foreign exchange on January 11, 
1976, the law applicable was Central Bank Circular No. 265 which requires that 
no person shall take out or export from the Philippines <span>any foreign 
exchange without prior </span>authority from the Central Bank, and thus, 
regardless of their being tourists and the source of the foreign exchange being 
brought out of the country, the requirement of prior authorization from the 
Central Bank <span>would still have to be complied with.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again 
respondent has seen this point in his opposition:<o:p></o:p></span> 
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">'6<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>Annexes</span> "A" and "B", even 
if admitted will not alter the result of the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>As we have 
stated earlier, <span>petitioners, at the time they tried to bring out the 
subject foreign currencies, had no permit </span>or authority from the Central 
Bank.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was a clear violation of Central Bank Circular No. 265, 
which required <span>all persons taking out foreign currency, regardless of its 
source, to secure the necessary permit or 
authority.'<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>"At any rate, even on the 
supposition, for the sake of argument, that on the basis of the law applicable 
here tourists or non-temporary<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>visitors who are bringing out of 
the country their own foreign exchange brought in by them are not required to 
secure a permit or authority from the Central Bank, and therefore, proof on the 
part of petitioners as to the source and ownership of the foreign exchange being 
brought by them out of the country is material and necessary, the documents 
referred to [Annexes 'A', 'A-1', 'B' &amp; 'B-1'] do not satisfy the legal 
requirements of a newly-discovered evidence under Section 1[b] of Rule 37 of the 
Rules of Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>For <span>if </span>it is true, as appearing in 
said documents, that the purchase and receipt of said currencies [dollars] were 
made in Japan on December 15, 1975, then the said documents were already in 
existence and known to petitioners when this case arose on January 11, 1976 and 
during the seizure proceedings before the Bureau of Customs and the hearing 
before this Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Besides, as admitted by petitioners in their 
supplemental motion, said evidence are not newly-discovered evidence.<span>&nbsp;

<blockquote><span>"Furthermore, it cannot be validly asserted that even with 
reason</span>able diligence the said documents could not have been discovered 
and produced at the trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>The records show that petitioners did 
not even appear to testify for their defense <span class="GramE">before the Bureau 
of Customs nor</span> before this Court, and their counsel never did even 
mention that there were such documents.<span>&nbsp; </span>At least before this Court 
wherein trial <em>de novo</em> can be availed of, petitioners could have 
testified, or through counsel, manifested that they have such documents showing 
the source of the subject foreign currencies and could have requested for time 
to produce said documents, if the same could not be produced at the time of the 
trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>But petitioners instead of availing trial before this <span class="GramE">Court,</span> chose to waive the same and submitted the case on the 
basis of the pleadings, the records of the Bureau of Customs and their written 
<span>memoranda.<span>&nbsp; </span>What measure of diligence, therefore, can be 
claimed by petitioners or their counsel in the production </span>of said 
evidence?<span>&nbsp; </span>Surely, we believe it would not be in consonance with 
the rules of established judicial procedure, nor in keeping with the principles 
of justice, if a party who has waived trial and who, subsequently lost his case, 
should be afforded new trial on the ground of 'newly-<span>discovered 
evidence'."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </span></blockquote>
