				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A claim for alleged unpaid commissions of an agent is what is
basically involved in the action at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Somehow, it twice escaped outright rejection for lack of jurisdiction in
the Department of Labor where the case was resolved at the first instance and on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the Labor Arbiter and the
National Labor Relations Commission appeared unaware of the utter lack of
labor-related issues in the parties’ conflicting contentions as to the
existence of <u>agency</u> relations between them, and proceeded to decide the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither of them of course had
competence to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may,
the instant petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> will be decided on its merits
to the end that the controversy may now be laid to rest without further
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The protagonists in this case are:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>
-- engaged, under the name and style of <span class="SpellE">Guardex</span>
Enterprises, in (a) the manufacture and sale of fire-fighting equipment such as
fire extinguishers, fire hose cabinets and related products, and (b)
occasionally, the building or fabrication of fire trucks; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) <span class="SpellE">Jumbee</span> <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span>
-- a "freelance" salesman.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> somehow learned that <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>
had offered to fabricate a fire truck for <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>
(Phil.) Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wrote to <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> inquiring about the amount of commission for the </span><span style="">sale </span><span style="">of a fire truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> wrote back on the same day to advise that it was
P15,000.00 per unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four days later, <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> offered to </span><span style="">look </span><span style="">after (follow-up) <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span> pending proposal to sell a fire truck to <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>, and asked for P250.00 as representation
expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>
agreed and gave him the money.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When no word was received
by <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> from <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span>
after three days, she herself inquired in writing from <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>
about her offer of sale of a fire truck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having apparently received an encouraging response, <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>
sent <span class="SpellE">Rubberword</span> a revised price quotation some ten
days later.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> sold </span><span style="">to
</span><span style="">other individuals some of <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span> fire extinguishers, receiving traveling expenses
in </span><span style="">connection</span><span style=""> therewith as well as the corresponding
commissions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then dropped out of
sight.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">About seven months
afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> herself finally concluded a
contract with <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span> </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the latter's purchase of a fire truck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The transaction was consummated with the delivery of the truck and full
payment thereof by <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At this point, <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> suddenly reappeared and asked for his commission for
the sale of the fire truck to <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> refused,
saying that he had had nothing to do with the offer, negotiation and
consummation of the sale.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Insisting that he was
entitled to the commission, <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> filed a complaint
against <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> with the Ministry of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter agreed with him and
rendered judgment in his favor, on August 26, 1982.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That judgment was affirmed by the National
Labor Relations Commission on December 29, 1983, </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
to annul those judgments as having been rendered with grave abuse </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">discretion if not indeed without or in excess of jurisdiction.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">claimed that an implied agency had been created between <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> on the basis
of the following circumstances:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1) the alleged verbal authority given to him to offer a fire
truck to <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>; <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2) the alleged written authority to sell the truck contained in a
letter of <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span> dated <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1978</st1:date>;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3) <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span> having given <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> P250.00 as representation expenses; and </p>

<p class="BODY">4) <span class="SpellE">Orbeta's</span> submission of a price
quotation to <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span> and his having arranged a
meeting between <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld's</span>
Purchasing Manager.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The circumstances have
not been correctly read by <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> and his
co-respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Escandor</span></span><span style=""> denies that she had ever given <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> any such verbal authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, months prior to <span class="SpellE">Orbeta's</span>
approaching <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>, the latter had already made a
written offer of a fire truck to <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">she consented to
was for <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> to "follow up" that pending
offer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, it does not even appear
that on the strength of this "arrangement" -- vague as it was -- <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> undertook the promised follow-up at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reported nothing of his efforts or their
fruits to <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> who, in the months that
followed her initial meeting with <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span>,
determinedly pushed the <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span> deal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> was simply
nowhere to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it
seems fairly evident that the "representation allowance" of P250 was
meant to cover the expenses for the "follow-up" offered by <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> -- an ambiguous fact which does not of itself
suggest the creation of an agency and is not at all inconsistent with the
theory of its absence in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even a finding that under
these circumstances, an agency had indeed been constituted will not save the
day for <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span>, because nothing in the record tends
to prove that he succeeded in carrying out its terms or even as much as
attempted to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence in fact
clearly indicates otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms
of <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span> letter of August 14, 1978 -- assuming
that it was indeed an "authority to sell," as <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span>
insists -- are to the effect that entitlement to the P15,000 commission is
contingent on the purchase by a customer of a fire truck, the implicit
condition being that the agent would earn the commission if he was instrumental
in bringing the sale about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> certainly had nothing to do with the sale of the
fire truck, and is not therefore entitled to any commission at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, even if <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> is considered to have been <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span>
agent for the time he was supposed to "follow up" the offer to sell,
such agency would have been deemed revoked upon the resumption of direct
negotiations between <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span> having in the meantime abandoned all efforts
(if indeed any were exerted) to secure the deal in <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span>
behalf.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It has of course already
been stated at the outset that, given the sole issue raised by the parties
concededly from the case's inception (i.e., whether or not <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span>
is <span class="SpellE">Escandor's</span> agent as regards the sale of a fire
truck to <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span>), the competence to resolve the
controversy did not pertain to either the Labor Arbiter or the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction vested in them by the Labor
Code extends, generally speaking, </span>only <span style="">to cases arising from </span><u>employer-employee</u> <span style="">relationships.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> What has all along been at issue here, as
advanced by the parties themselves and as is evident from the facts, is the
existence of a contract of </span><u>agency</u><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
-- <span style="">not employment or lease of
services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed a puzzle how the
fundamental differences between the two</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> altogether escaped not only the parties’
counsel in this case but also the tribunals before which it had been
brought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, since no one has
thought to question their authority even up to this late stage, as in fact all
the parties appear to have completely accepted the validity of their exercise
of jurisdiction over the case, the Court has opted, as already stated, to
render </span>judgment <span style="">on its merits
and end the controversy once and for all.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

provided by Art. 1700 thereof, an employment contract or lease of service (as it

Both involve the rendition of services by one party to the other, but the
similarity ends there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis of
agency is representation, the agent being the representative of his principal,
while the basis of lease of service is employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Nielson &amp; Company, Inc, <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated Mining, 26 SCRA 540).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agency is merely a preparatory contract which
empowers the agent to execute juridical acts to bring about contractual
relations between his principal and third persons (Padilla, Civil Code
