<p class="BODY">In an information dated <st1:date month="2" day="25" year="1971">February
 25, 1971</st1:date>, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>
charged <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>, alias
"<st1:place>Milo</st1:place>", and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>, alias "<span class="SpellE">Canie</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>", before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> of the crime of robbery with homicide allegedly
committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 13th day of February, 1970, in the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dauis</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, Philippines, the above-named accused, both armed
with firearms, with intent of gain, and conspiring, confederating and helping
each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot
treacherously <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span>,
a driver who was then driving a Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span> Sons, Inc.
delivery truck, inflicting upon him serious physical injuries which caused his
immediate death, and immediately thereafter said accused by continued serious
intimidation took and carried away from <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>, a salesman of said Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span>
Sons, Inc. who was also on the said delivery truck, cash money <span class="GramE">amounting</span> to P3,500.00, Philippine Currency, belonging to
the said Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span> Sons, Inc., to the damage and
prejudice of the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span>, of <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span> and of said Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span>
Sons, Inc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> committed the said crime with the additional
aggravating circumstance of <span class="SpellE">habituality</span>, he having
been pre­viously punished for murder, an offense to which the law attaches an
equal penalty with that for which he is presently charged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Acts committed contrary to the provisions of Article 293 and
294, no. 1 of the Revised Penal Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon being arraigned, both accused pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where­upon, the court proceeded with the
trial of the case and on <st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1971">August 31,
 1971</st1:date> rendered the following judgment:</p>

<blockquote>"FROM ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, both defendants <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>, with deep regrets,
have to be, as they are hereby sentenced to death for robbery with homicide;
and to pay P3<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> to Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span>
Sons, Inc., for which <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>
is accountable to the latter, and P12,000.00 for the death of <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> payable to his
heirs, both to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record reveals the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date month="2" day="13" year="1970">February
 13, 1970</st1:date>, a cargo truck of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span>
Sons, Inc., driven by <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span>,
left <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>,
for <span class="SpellE">Panglao</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>,
to deliver corn grits, corn grain, corn <span style="">bran
and salt to the customers of said company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>,
a salesman of the company, was the "<span class="SpellE">jefe</span> de <span class="SpellE">viaje</span>" and <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> was the "cargo boy".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made several stops in the different
barrios on their way to <span class="SpellE">Panglao</span> in order to sell the
merchandise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time hour="14" minute="30">2:30</st1:time> in the
afternoon, the cargo truck was on its way back to <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it had to make several stops in order
to collect some payments for the corn grits and corn bran.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During its last stop at barrio <span class="SpellE">Songcolan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dauis</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>, two students hitched a ride on the
truck, followed by the two appellants, <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
students sat on the front seat with driver <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span>
and salesman <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span> while the two appellants sat at
the back with the cargoes and with "cargo boy" <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> was about a
meter from <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> while <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>
was about one fathom from said "cargo boy".</p>

<p class="BODY">The cargo truck had just negotiated a distance of less than one
kilometer from barrio <span class="SpellE">Songcolan</span> when <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> shouted:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<st1:place>Para</st1:place><span class="GramE">! "</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> stopped the truck and looked back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> then drew
his pistol and aimed it at the driver, shouting:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nobody move! You bring the truck up to
the corner!" But immediately thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>
shot <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> while <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>
aimed his pistol at <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hit by <span class="SpellE">Arcamo's</span>
bullet, <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> slumped down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stricken by fear, <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>
and the two students ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span> likewise went down the truck and was about to run
away when one of the appellants, who was still on board the truck, ordered him
to raise his hands and demanded money from him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As he was ordered to raise his hands, <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>
put the bag containing his collections and receipts on the seat of the
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants then took the bag,
with all its contents, and ran away escaping through the bushes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span> like wise
ran away, following the road, and proceeded to the office of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span> Sons, Inc. to report the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>, who ran
towards the river and stayed there for about ten minutes, went back to the
delivery truck where he saw <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> sprawled in blood
and dying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>
noticed a wound at the left portion of <span class="SpellE">Balabag's</span> nape
where <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> previously aimed his gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long thereafter, a certain Boy <span class="SpellE">Cimafranca</span>, with some companions, arrived on a jeep from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They brought <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span>
to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was attended to by Dr. Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Timaan</span>, the
medico-legal officer on duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
shortly thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span>
died.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Timaan</span>, assisted by Dr.
Henry <span class="SpellE">Doliente</span>, conducted an autopsy of the body of <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> and found that his death was due to severe bleeding
and injuries to the brain caused by the bullet which penetrated his skull and
reached the other side of his head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The slug (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A-3) was found on
the right side of the upper part of <span class="SpellE">Balabag's</span> head.</p>

<p class="BODY">Six days after the incident, the bag which was taken from <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span> was retrieved in barrio <span class="SpellE">Songcolan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dauis</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was found under the bushes near the house
of a certain person surnamed <span class="SpellE">Ongkayo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the bag was a notebook (containing a
list of debtors) and three receipt booklets; but the amount representing the
payments for the merchandise was no longer <span class="GramE">there.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants have assigned two errors which were supposedly
committed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the first assignment of error they claim that the lower court erred
in giving credence to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> and
in not giving credence to the testimony of the defense witnesses, including the
appellants themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second
assignment is <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> and is a consequence of the first; in it
the appellants claim that the lower court erred in convicting them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>
was the only person who positively identified the appellants as the ones who
boarded the Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span> Sons, Inc. delivery truck at
barrio <span class="SpellE">Songcolan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dauis</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>, along with the two <span style="">students, </span>and sat near him at the back
of the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it was <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> who testified having actually seen <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> shoot <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> while <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> aimed his gun at <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable, therefore, why
appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, in the
first assignment of error, assails the action of the trial court in giving
credence to the testimony of this eyewitness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But in order to successfully assail the conclusion of the trial court
regarding the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>, the
appellants have to satisfy Us that the trial court had "plainly overlooked
certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the
result of the case" (People v. Mercado, et al., L-39511-39513, April 28,
1980, 97 SCRA 232, citing a long line of cases).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For settled is the rule that "when the
issue is one of credibility of witnesses, appellate courts will generally not
disturb the findings of the trial court, considering that it is in a better
position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and
observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial"
(People v. Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Sajines</span>, L-41537-41538, February
24, 1981, citing a long line of cases).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
points to certain circumstances which allegedly destroy the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> but were not considered by <span style="">the </span>trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But upon a careful analysis of said
circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span> are of the opinion that they do not
constitute sufficient justification for disturbing the conclusion of the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
first points to the fact that when <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> was
testifying, he could not look straight at the appellants and that he kept
answering in a low voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants'
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> would infer from the <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> that he
was relating a fabricated story and that his conscience was bothering him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the inference to be unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as correctly pointed out by the Solicitor
General, said demeanor was only to be expected from a 19 year old "cargo
boy" who did not even finish second grade in school and who was then
testifying against two persons with prior criminal records - <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> having been previously convicted of murder (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE">while</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>
had a pending case for robbery in band.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Diola</span> was acquitted in a decision dated <st1:date month="4" day="22" year="1970">April 22, 1970</st1:date>, after <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> had testified. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE"> 2.)</span> In fact, <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> admitted in open court that he was afraid of the
appellants as they might nourish hatred against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And no evidence whatsoever was presented to
show any motive on the part of <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> to testify falsely
against <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, to question his credibility would be to
unreasonably and unjustifiably impute evil or wrongful intention upon a person
who, despite fear of reprisal by the appellants, had undergone the ordeal of
testifying against them in court if only to bring justice to the death of his
co-worker.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
next points to the fact that when asked by a certain schoolteacher by the name
of Mrs. Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Circulado</span> whether her house-helper, <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>, was one of the
perpetrators of the crime, <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> replied in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this answer was
sufficiently explained by <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> upon
cross-examination.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
the direct examination you testified that the accused <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diola</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Canie</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> was one of the robbers; on cross-examination you told
the Court that when you were confronted by a certain lady teacher who presented
to you the accused <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Canie</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> and asked
you in <span class="SpellE">Tamblot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>
City, whether the said person was one of the robbers and you answered her 'No,
he was not', now, which is the true fact now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>I
was afraid to tell the truth because the school teacher fumed or was angry</u>."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,
<span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>, April 7, 1970, pp. 34-35; underscoring
supplied.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">That Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Circulado</span>
was indeed fuming in anger was manifest in the way she presented her
house-helper before <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Circulado</span>
herself admitted, she literally dragged <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> towards <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> before
asking him whether her house-helper was one of the perpetrators of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Expectedly, the intimidating
posture of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Circulado</span> elicited a negative answer
from the young witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the negative reply of <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>
was in obedience to the instruction given to him by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lonod</span> (the PC officer who accompanied him in looking
for and identifying the persons who perpetrated the crime) before he was
confronted by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Circulado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On direct examination, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lonod</span> testified -</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
reaching the place, what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After arrival, after a few minutes on our
arrival, a person arrived with a motorcycle, later known as <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diola</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did you do when the person riding on a motorcycle arrived?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">A</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> if he is the same person who was with… </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
do you mean he is the same person?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because</span> I do not know yet the person
of <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>; only <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> knows
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him if he is the person
with Milo <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> on the 13th.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
that person who arrived riding on a motorcycle, did he have a companion that
afternoon of February 17?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
was alone riding a motorcycle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then,
when you asked <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>,
what did the latter tell you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
asked if he is <span class="SpellE">Canie</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me that he is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>I cautioned him not to pin-point him
anymore</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whom
did you <span class="GramE">caution</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
<span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> told
you that that man riding on a motorcycle who arrived is <span class="SpellE">Canie</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diola</span>, was that within the hearing distance of <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No,
sir.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just few meters,
around five meters from the place where we were staying.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> hear that?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, why did you caution <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> not to point anymore?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u>I just cautioned him because he
might evade from us if he heard his words.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>At
that time was there a warrant of arrest with you?<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">There </span>was none</u>."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It can thus be seen that before he was
confronted by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Circulado</span>, <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>
had already revealed to the investigating officer that <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diola</span> was the companion of <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> in perpetrating the crime and that said
witness was cautioned by the investigating officer not to pin-point him as he
might evade them before they could secure a warrant for his arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable therefore why <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> had to give a
negative reply when asked by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Circulado</span>, in the
presence of <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>,
whether <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> was one of the perpetrators of the
crime.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
next contends that <span class="SpellE">Horcerada's</span> testimony was an
"eleventh hour fabrication" since, allegedly, "it was only after
the fourth day, when the peace officers could not find any clue, that witness <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> revealed the identities of the two accused?appellants."
We find the contention to be entirely bereft of factual support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tabalado</span>, Chief of the Intelligence Section of the
Philippine Constabulary, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, on the very day of
the commission of the offense (i.e., February 13, 1970), <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span> reported the incident to the P. C. headquarters
and they gave him the descriptions of the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was precisely on the basis of the
information given by said witnesses that the Philippine Constabulary of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> conducted a surveillance of <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> for a period of three days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What perhaps misled appellants' counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> into believing that <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span>
revealed the identities of the appellants "only after the fourth day"
was the fact that it was only on February 17, <span style="">1970, </span>or after said three day period of surveillance or what the
P.C. investigators called the "covered" or "discreet" phase
of investigation, that the said investigators picked up the appellants for
formal questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it was only
after said "covered" or "discreet" investigation that the
Philippine Constabulary conducted its "open" or "overt"
investigation (see:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>testimony of P.C.
Sgt. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Fabricante</span>, May 11, <span style="">1970, </span>pp. 54-56, <span class="SpellE">Remolador</span>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
likewise assails the trial court's action of disregarding the testimonies of
the defense witnesses who tried to establish defendants' alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> have already satisfied </span>ourselves with <span class="SpellE">Horcerada's</span>
credibility and since <span style="">said witness had
positively identified the appellants as the perpetrators of the crime, We find
no reason </span>to <span style="">still dwell on the
issue of credibility of the </span>defense witnesses and the validity of
defendants' alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For settled is the
rule that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification
of <span style="">the </span>accused by credible witnesses
as the authors of the crime (People v. Mercado, et al., L-39511-39513, April
28, 1980, 97 SCRA. 232, citing a long line of cases).</p>

<p class="BODY">The commission by <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> of the crime of robbery with homicide had been proven
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> had
positively identified them as the <span class="GramE">ones</span> who boarded the
cargo section of the Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span> Sons, Inc. delivery
truck at barrio <span class="SpellE">Songcolan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dauis</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>, and upon reaching a
bushy area of said barrio, drew their guns and, with <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>
aiming his gun at salesman <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> shot driver <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> who
thereupon slumped down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span>, on the other
hand, testified that immediately thereafter, one of the appellants ordered him
to raise his hands and demanded money from him and that both appellants then
took the bag containing the cash representing the payments for the merchandise
which they have sold during the day and both escaped through the bushes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span> died of the bullet wound was established by Dr.
Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Timaan</span>, the medico-legal officer who
performed an autopsy of the body of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumactud</span> stated at the witness stand that he did not
recognize the face of the person who demanded money from him, this does not,
however, mean that the robbers were not sufficiently identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For said witness was categorical in stating
that the persons who took the bag containing his collections were the two
persons who boarded the back of the <span class="GramE">truck,</span> and, as
heretofore stated, appellants <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> were positively identified by witness <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> <span class="SpellE">Horcerada</span> as the
persons who boarded the back of the delivery truck.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court imposed upon the appellants the penalty of
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held that the crime of robbery
with homicide was committed with the attendance of the aggravating
circumstances of evident premeditation, firearm, uninhabited place, and <span class="SpellE">habituality</span> (as regards appellant <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>),
without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="GramE">We</span> find the
aggravating circumstances of uninhabited place and <span class="SpellE">habituality</span>
(as regards appellant <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>) as sufficiently
established, We cannot, however, agree with the trial court in considering
evident premeditation and use of firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its reliance on the fact that the appellants acted in concert from the
time they boarded the truck up to the time they disappeared as its basis for
finding the existence of evident premeditation cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, while such concert of actions proves
conspiracy, it does <span style="">not </span>necessarily
show the existence of evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To establish evident premeditation, it is necessary to prove:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the time when the offender determined to
commit the crime; (b) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit had clung
to his determination; and (c) a sufficient lapse of time <span style="">between </span>the determination and the
execution of the crime to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act
and to allow his conscience to overcome the resolution of his will (People v. <span class="SpellE">Beralde</span>, L-32832, June 29, 1979, 91 SCRA 125, citing a long
line of cases).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such essential elements
cannot be inferred from the mere fact that the appellants acted in
concert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the prosecution did
not intend to prove evident premeditation as it did not even allege the same in
the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as regards the use
of firearm, the same cannot be considered an aggravating circumstance in the
complex crime of robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court failed to appreciate the aggravating circumstance
of treachery and, with respect to appellant <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>,
the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery was sufficiently established by the
fact that <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Balabag</span>
was shot at the back and that the shooting was so sudden and unexpected that
the victim did not have the slightest opportunity to defend himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Page 9 of the <span class="SpellE"><u>expediente</u></span> shows that <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>
surrendered to the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span> on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 19, 1970</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the crime of robbery with homicide was committed by the
accused-appellants with the attendance of the aggravating circumstances of
uninhabited place, treachery and, with respect to appellant <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">habituality</span>, with no sufficient mitigating
circumstance to offset the same (there being none for appellant <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> and only one for appellant <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>),
the trial court correctly imposed upon the appellants the penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of P3,500.00 required by said trial court to be paid
by the appellants to Lim <span class="SpellE">Tiaoco</span> Sons, Inc. should,
however, be reduced to P700.00 since, according to <span class="SpellE">Lumactad</span>
himself, such was the actual cash amount taken from him by the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference between the amount stated in
the information (P3<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>) and the amount actually
taken from the salesman (P700.00) allegedly represents the amount which the
company could no longer collect from its debtors by reason of the fact that the
notebook containing the list of its debtors was likewise taken by the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the record shows that the
notebook containing the list of the debtors of the company was recovered six
days after the incident, along with the bag and the receipt booklets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, no legal justification exists for
requiring the appellants to pay the company the full amount of P3<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, or P2,800.00 in excess of the amount actually taken
from its salesman.</p>

<p class="BODY">Except for the foregoing modifications, the decision under review
is hereby affirmed in all respects.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, appellants <span class="SpellE">Hermilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> are hereby convicted of the complex crime of robbery with
homicide and each of them is sentenced to suffer the penalty of death and to
