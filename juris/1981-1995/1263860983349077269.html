<p class="BODY">During the investigation by the Regional Director, the petitioner
offered to pay P7<span class="GramE">,000</span> to <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>
by way of compromise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Initially, <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span> agreed to accept that amount but he later changed
his mind and refused to compromise.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> of his claims by
the Regional Director, it was found that he was entitled to receive the total
sum of P21<span class="GramE">,753.50</span> on his claims.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed to DOLE, alleging that the Regional
Director erred in not setting off against <span class="SpellE">Tarroza's</span>
claims his liability to the company for tools and spare parts worth P36,450.00
which were allegedly lost while in his "custody" as watchman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The losses were discovered during an
inventory of the contents of the warehouse on <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1987</st1:date>, or some two months after <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span> and his co-employees had complained about the
company's violations of labor standards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Undersecretary of Labor ruled that there is no law making <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span> liable for the loss of the tools and spare parts
inside the petitioner's shop and that, moreover, <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>
was not given a reasonable opportunity to refute the company's claim for
deductions from his salaries and benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The company's appeal was dismissed for lack of merit on <st1:date year="1988" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1988</st1:date> (Annex L).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It elevated the matter to this Court where it
was docketed as G.R. No. 85278.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the labor
standards case, the company issued an order transferring <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>
to its shop in <span class="SpellE">Tagunay</span>, Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del Norte, but <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span> refused to comply with the
order, so he was dismissed from the service in May 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1987</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span> filed before the Labor Arbiter of the NLRC a
complaint for illegal dismissal with a prayer for reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> (Case No. RAB-11-09-004350-87, entitled
"Romeo <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span> vs. RTG Construction, Inc.”).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1988</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered by the Labor Arbiter declaring his dismissal illegal
and ordering the petitioner to reinstate him to his former position without
loss of seniority rights and with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from
the date of his dismissal up to his actual reinstatement (Annex I).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed to the NLRC which, on <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1988</st1:date>, dismissed the appeal
"for being filed out of time." (Annex M.)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC affirmed the decision of the Labor
Arbiter (Annex F).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the
petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
resolution was denied (Annex N), it filed this second petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
G.R. No. 85918.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first petition for <i>certiorari</i> (G.R. No. 85278) alleges
that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"I - THE REGIONAL
DIRECTOR ACTED WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF HIS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 85918, the petitioner alleges that the NLRC gravely
abused its discretion in ordering the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>
with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both petitions have no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition in G.R. No. 85278 assails the jurisdiction of DOLE
and of its Regional Director to pass upon <span class="SpellE">Tarroza's</span>
claims for salary differentials, holiday pay, 13th month pay and night shift
differential.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that the
original and exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate money claims pertains to the
Labor Arbiter under Article 217 of the Labor Code, as amended by PD 1691
effective <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That argument is not well taken for ever since PD No. 850 was
issued on December 16, 1975, giving the Regional Directors not only <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span>, but enforcement powers as well, labor standards
cases have been removed from the arbitration arm (under Article 217) and transferred
to the enforcement system of the Ministry of Labor (Maternity Children's
Hospital vs. Secretary of Labor, G.R. No. 78909, June 30, 1989).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In Maternity Children's Hospital vs. Secretary of Labor, <u>supra</u>
this Court pointed out that the enforcement/adjudication authority of the
Regional Director over uncontested money claims in cases where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>employer-employee relationship
still exists, was confirmed and reiterated in Executive Order No. 111, dated <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1986</st1:date>, amending Article
128 (b) of the Labor Code, as follows:<i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

underscoring supplied.)</span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of Executive Order No. 111, the jurisdiction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the Regional Director of the DOLE
over <span class="SpellE">Tarroza's</span> claims in LSED ROXI Case No. 83-86 is
unassailable.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's allegation that it was denied due process because it
was not allowed to present its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">payrolls
</span>to refute <span class="SpellE">Tarroza's</span> claims for <span class="GramE">differentials,</span> is not correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC found that:</p>

<blockquote><i>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
respondent was given more than ample time to present its payrolls and other
documentary evidence to disprove the claims of </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

payrolls were already forwarded to its Central Office in </i><st1:city><st1:place><i>Manila</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>
is no defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent should
remember that in labor standards cases, the burden of proof rests on the
employer to show that it has not committed any violation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this respect, the payrolls are the best
evidence to show proof of compliance with the mandate of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, respondent chose not to present it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we find no reason to deny complainant’s
claims in the absence of contrary proof from respondent." <span class="GramE">(p. 56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G.R. No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">85278.)</span></span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The employer-employee relationship having been severed by his
dismissal from the company, <span class="SpellE">Tarroza's</span> claim for
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> was properly filed
before the Labor Arbiter of the NLRC pursuant to Article 217 of the Labor Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no overlapping of jurisdictions between the Regional
Director and the Labor Arbiter over <span class="SpellE">Tarroza's</span> claims
because his claims under the labor standards laws (LSED ROXI Case No. 83-86)
covered only the differentials due him from the date of his employment in the
company up to the date of his dismissal in May 1986, while his claim for
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> (Case No.
