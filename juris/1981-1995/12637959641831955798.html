<p class="BODY">"'<em>Ex pacto</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>illicito</em></span><em>’ non oritur</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>actio</em></span>' (No action arises out of illicit bargain) 
<span>is </span>the time-honored maxim that must be applied to the parties in 
the case at bar.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having entered into an illegal contract, neither 
can seek relief from the courts, and each must bear the consequences of his 
acts." <span class="GramE"><span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Lita</em></span><em> 
Enterpri</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;">ses vs. IAC</span><span>, 
129</span> <span>SCRA 81.)</span></span><b><span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="BODY">The factual background of this case is undisputed.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The same is narrated by the respondent court in its now assailed 
decision, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="5" day="9" year="1975">May 9, 1975</st1:date>, 
the defendant bought from the plaintiff a motorcycle with complete accessories 
and a sidecar in the total consideration of P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> 
as shown by Invoice No. 144 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A").<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Out of the total purchase price the defendant gave a <span class="SpellE">downpayment</span> of P<span>1<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> 
</span>with a promise that he would pay plaintiff the balance within sixty 
days.<span>&nbsp; </span>The defendant, however, failed to <span>comply with his 
promise and so upon his own re</span>quest, <span>the period of paying the 
balance was extended to one year in monthly installments until January 1976 when 
he stopped paying anymore.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>The <span>plaintiff made demands 
but just the same the defendant failed to comply with the same thus forcing the 
plaintiff to consult a </span><span>lawyer<i> </i></span><span>and file this 
action for his damage in the amount of P546.21 for attorney's fees and 
P</span>100.00 <span>for expenses of litigation.<span>&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff 
also claims that as of </span><st1:date month="2" day="20" year="1978"><span>February 20, 1978</span></st1:date><span>, the total account 
of the defendant was already P2<span class="GramE">,731.05</span> as shown in a 
statement of account (Exhibit "B").<span>&nbsp; </span>This amount includes not only 
the balance of P1<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> but an additional 12% interest 
per annum on the said balance from </span><st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1976"><span>January 26, 1976</span></st1:date><span> to </span><st1:date month="2" day="27" year="1978"><span>February 27, 1978</span></st1:date><span>; 
a 2% service charge; and P546.21 representing attorney's 
fees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"In this particular transaction a chattel mortgage (Exhibit 1) was 
constituted as a security for the payment of the balance of the purchase 
price.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has been the practice of financing firms that whenever 
there is a balance of the purchase price the registration papers of the motor 
vehicle subject of the sale are not given <span>to the buyer.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
records of the LTC show that the motorcycle sold to the defendant was first 
mortgaged to the <span class="SpellE">Teja</span> Marketing by Angel <span class="SpellE">Jaucian</span> though the <span class="SpellE">Teja</span> Marketing 
and Angel <span class="SpellE">Jaucian</span> are one and the same, because it was 
made to appear that way only as the defendant had no franchise of his own and he 
attached the unit to the plaintiff's MCH Line.<span>&nbsp; </span>The agreement also 
of the parties here was for the plaintiff to undertake the yearly registration 
of the motorcycle with the Land Transportation Commission.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Pursuant to this agreement the defendant on </span><st1:date month="2" day="22" year="1976"><span>February 22, 1976</span></st1:date><span> gave the 
plaintiff P90.00, the P8.00 would be for the mortgage fee and the P82.00 for the 
registration fee of the motorcycle.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">plaintiff,</span> however failed to register the motorcycle on that 
year on the ground that the defendant failed to comply with some requirements 
such as the payment of the insurance premiums and the bringing of the motorcycle 
to the LTC for stenciling, the plaintiff saying that the defendant was hiding 
the motorcycle from him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the plaintiff explained also that 
though the ownership of the motorcycle was already transferred to the defendant 
</span>the vehicle was still mortgaged with the consent of the defendant to the 
Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Camaligan</span> for the reason that all 
motorcycle purchased from the plaintiff on credit was rediscounted with the 
bank.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"On his part the defendant did not dispute the sale and the 
outstanding balance of P1<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> still payable to the 
plaintiff.<span>&nbsp; </span>The defendant </span>was persuaded to buy from the 
plaintiff the motorcycle with the side car because of the condition that the 
plaintiff would be the one to register every year the motorcycle with the Land 
Transportation Commission.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 1976, however, the plaintiff failed 
to register both the chattel mortgage and the motorcycle with the LTC 
notwithstanding the fact that the defendant gave him P90.00 for mortgage fee and 
registration fee and had the motorcycle insured with La <span class="SpellE">Perla</span> <span class="SpellE">Compana</span> de <span class="SpellE">Seguros</span> (Exhibit "6") as shown also by the Certificate of 
cover (Exhibit "3").<span>&nbsp; </span>Because of this failure of the plaintiff to 
comply with his obligation to register the motorcycle the defendant suffered 
damages when he failed to claim any insurance indemnity which would amount to no 
less than P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for the more than two times that 
the motorcycle figured in accidents aside from the loss of the daily income of 
P15.00 as boundary fee beginning October 1976 when the motorcycle was impounded 
by the LTC for not being registered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The <span>defendant disputed the claim of the plaintiff that he was 
hiding from the plaintiff the motorcycle resulting in its not being 
registered.<span>&nbsp; </span>The truth being that the motorcycle was being used for 
transporting passengers and it kept on <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> from 
one place to another.<span>&nbsp; </span>The motor vehicle sold to him was mortgaged 
by the plaintiff with the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Camaligan</span> 
without his consent and knowledge and the defendant was not even given a copy of 
the mortgage deed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The defendant claims that it is not true that 
the motorcycle was mortgaged because of re-discounting for re-discounting is 
only true with Rural Banks and the Central Bank.<span>&nbsp; </span>The defendant 
puts the blame on the plaintiff for not registering the motorcycle with the LTC 
and for not giving him the registration papers <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> 
of demands made.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally, the evidence of the defendant shows that 
because of the filing of this case he was forced to retain the services of a 
lawyer for a fee on not less than P1<span class="GramE">,<span>000.00</span></span></span><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it also 
appears and the Court so finds that defendant purchased the motorcycle in 
question, particularly for the purpose of engaging and using the same in the 
transportation business and for this purpose <em>said trimobile unit was 
attached to the plaintiff's transportation line who had the franchise, so much 
so that in the registration certificate, the plaintiff appears to be the owner 
of the unit</em><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it appears to have been 
agreed, further between the plaintiff and the defendant, that plaintiff would 
undertake the yearly registration of the unit in question with the LTC.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thus, for the registration of the unit for the year 1976, per agreement, 
the defendant gave to the plaintiff the amount of P82.00 for its registration, 
</span>as<i> </i><span>well as the insurance coverage of the 
unit."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Eventually, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teja</span> Marketing 
and/or Angel <span class="SpellE">Jaucian</span> filed an action for "Sum of Money 
with Damages" against private respondent Pedro N. <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> 
in <span>the </span>City Court of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The City Court rendered judgment in favor of petitioner, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

legal rate of interest from the date of the filing of the complaint until the 
same is fully paid; to pay plaintiff the sum of P546.21 as attorney's fees; to 
pay plaintiff the sum of P200.00 as expenses of litigation; and to pay the 
costs.</blockquote>

</span>Private respondent filed a petition for review with the Intermediate 
Appellate Court and on July 18, 1983, the said Court promulgated its decision, 
the pertinent portion of which reads —</p>
<blockquote>"However, as the purchase of the motorcycle for operation as a <span class="SpellE">trimobile</span> under the franchise of the private respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Jaucian</span>, pursuant to what is commonly known as the 
'<span class="SpellE"><em>kabit</em></span> system,' without the prior approval of 
the Board of Transportation (formerly the Public Service Commission) was an 
illegal transaction involving the fictitious registration of the motor vehicle 
in the name of the <span>private </span>respondent so that he may traffic with 
the <span>privileges </span>of his franchise, or certificate of public 
convenience, to operate a tricycle service, the parties being <em>in pari</em>

<p class="BODY">The decision is now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> on a 
petition for review, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teja</span> Marketing and/or 
Angel <span class="SpellE">Jaucian</span> presenting a lone assignment of error — 
whether or not respondent court erred in applying the doctrine of "<span class="SpellE"><em>pari</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>delicto</em></span>."</p>
<p class="BODY">We find the petition devoid of merit.</p>
<p class="BODY">Unquestionably, the parties herein operated under an arrangement, 
commonly known as the "<span class="SpellE"><em>kabit</em></span><em> system</em>" 
whereby a person who has been granted a certificate of public convenience allows 
another person who owns motor vehicles to operate under such franchise for a 
fee.<span>&nbsp; </span>A certificate of public convenience is a special privilege 
conferred by the government.<span>&nbsp; </span>Abuse of this privilege by the 
grantees thereof cannot be countenanced.<span>&nbsp; </span>The "<span class="SpellE"><em>kabit</em></span><em> system</em>" has been identified as one 
of the root causes of the prevalence of graft and corruption in the government 
transportation offices.</p>
<p class="BODY">Although not <span class="SpellE">outrightly</span> penalized as a 
criminal offense, the <span class="SpellE">kabit</span> system is invariably 
recognized as being contrary to public policy and, therefore, void and 
inexistent under Article 1409 of the Civil Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>It <span>is 
</span>a fundamental principle that the court will not aid either party to 
enforce an illegal contract, but will leave them both where it finds 
then.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon this premise it would be error to accord the parties 
relief from their predicament.<span>&nbsp; </span>Article 1412 of the Civil Code 
denies them such aid.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>It </span>provides:</p>
<blockquote>"Art. 1412.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the <span>act </span>in which the 
unlawful or forbidden cause consists does not constitute a criminal offense, the 
following rules shall be observed:</blockquote>
<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>When</span> the <span>fault 
</span>is on the part of both contracting parties, neither may recover that he 
has given by virtue of <span>the </span>contract, or demand, <span>the 
</span>performance of the other's undertaking."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The defect of inexistence of a contract is permanent and cannot 
<span>be cured by ratification or by prescription.<span>&nbsp; </span>The mere lapse 
of time </span>cannot give efficacy to contracts that are null and void.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby dismissed for lack of 
merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>The assailed decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court 
(now the Court of Appeals) is AFFIRMED.<span>&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
