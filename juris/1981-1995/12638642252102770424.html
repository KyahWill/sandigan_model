an accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
testified that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>he was an electrician
employed at Baghdad International Airport; that on March 23, 1982, he was
walking behind Cesar Rivera; that they were carrying boxes of electrical
fittings; that Cesar Rivera tripped on the marble flooring causing his violent
fall; that his head hit the concrete floor; that he saw the upper right
forehead of Cesar Rivera bleeding; and he and three (3) other co-workers rushed
him to the hospital where he died on the same day [TSN, August 27, 1986, pp.

deemed submitted for decision.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main issues for resolution in the instant case are (1)
whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in holding petitioner liable to
private respondent under Policy No. UPA-100001; and, (2) whether or not the
Court of Appeals ruled correctly in awarding attorney's fees to private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">A </span>resolution of the
first issue hinges on whether or not the respondent court committed reversible
error in its appreciation of the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the Court is faced with diametrically opposed conclusions of the
Insurance Commission and the Court of Appeals notwithstanding the fact that the
same set of evidence was presented before them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Insurance Commission dismissed private respondent's complaint after
concluding that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> on the
alleged accidental fall of the deceased on March 23, 1982 should not be given
credence "for being inconsistent with the letter of Erectors, Inc. to
[Stronghold] requesting reconsideration of the denial of the claim"
wherein the accident was stated to have occurred on December 15, 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">These inconsistent dates,
according to the Insurance Commission, "creates</span> doubt as to the
truth of complainant's contention that Cesar Rivera's death was
accidental." [Insurance Commission Decision, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">pp. </span>5-6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 25-26.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent appellate court found <span class="SpellE">Buendia's</span> testimony supported by the NBI Exhumation Report
[Annex "G"] showing that the deceased had broken or fractured ribs as
sufficient to support the conclusion that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">p</span>roximate cause of Cesar Rivera's death was his accidental fall
on <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1982</st1:date> which
occurred in the course of his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, according to the Court of Appeals, his<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"> </span>death is covered by Policy No. UPA-100001 and his wife is
entitled to the P75<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> insurance benefit [CA
Decision, pp. 3-4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 29-30.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition for review, Stronghold contests the above
findings of the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
insists that Cesar Rivera's death was caused by myocardial infarction or heart
attack as clearly stated in his Certificate of Death [Annex "A"],
International Certificate for Transportation of Cadavers [Annex "B"]
and NBI Exhumation Report [Annex "G".] Said cause of death is not
accidental and therefore, is not within the coverage of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">Policy </span>No. <span class="GramE">UPA-100001.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, on the other hand, strongly relies on <span class="SpellE">Buendia's</span> testimony on the alleged accidental fall of Cesar
Rivera on <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">is a</span> basic rule
in evidence that each party in a case must prove his own affirmative
allegations [Sec. 1, Rule 131 of the Revised Rules of Court] by the degree of
evidence required by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In civil
cases, as in the present case, the degree of evidence required of a party in
order to support his claim is preponderance of evidence or that evidence
adduced by one party which is more conclusive and credible than that of the
other party [Municipality <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">of </span><span class="SpellE">Moncada</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Cajuigan</span>, 21 Phil. 184
(1912).] It is therefore incumbent upon plaintiff who is claiming a right over
the insurance policy to prove his case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Corollary to this, defendant-insurance company must likewise prove its
own allegations to buttress its claim that it is not liable under the insurance
policy [Tai Tong <span class="SpellE">Chuache</span> &amp; Co. v. Insurance
Commission, G.R. No. 55397, February 29, 1988, 158 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that respondent appellate court did not commit
reversible error in ruling in favor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span><span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> Rivera.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent has clearly shown that an accident immediately
preceded the death of Cesar Rivera on <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="3">March
 23, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Felicitas</span></span><span class="GramE">
Rivera's witness, <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>, described in detail the
violent fall of Cesar Rivera.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
NBI Exhumation Report [Annex "G"] showing that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th
ribs of the deceased were completely fractured is further proof of this violent
fall.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That Cesar Rivera was rushed to
the hospital for treatment but died on the same day was also recounted by <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> on the witness’ stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These all point to the fact that his
accidental fall was the proximate cause or "that cause, which, in natural
and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces
the injury, and without which the result would not have occurred" [<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> v. Medina, 102
Phil. 181, 186 citing 38 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 695-696] which led
to the death of Cesar Rivera although the immediate cause thereof may have been
myocardial infarction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such being the
case, his death is covered by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Personal
Accident Policy No. UPA-100001 and is thus compensable [</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">See </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Further, the Court finds
that the alleged inaccuracy between <span class="SpellE">Buendia's</span>
testimony and Erectors' letter to Stronghold [Record, pp. 34-35] regarding the
date of the occurrence of the accident is not sufficient to cast doubt on the
veracity of <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> Rivera's claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inconsistency in dates is not so material
in this case where the principal issue involved is the cause of death of the
deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner Stronghold
had the opportunity to cross-examine <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> on this
alleged inaccuracy when he took the witness’ stand but it did not </span>do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, as
correctly </span>stated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by the Court of
Appeals, the evidence for Stronghold is "short of what is convincing and
unmistakable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did not suffice to
disprove [<span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> Rivera's] thesis that the
proximate cause of death of her late husband was a service connected accident,
within the coverage of the insurance policy contract of [Stronghold]." [CA
Decision, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">That the

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top:12.0pt">In the instant case an examination of
the record would reveal that Cesar Rivera’s death certificate [Annex
"A"] was not registered with the Civil Register and hence, cannot be
considered a public document as would make applicable the presumption that the
entries found therein are correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
granting that the death certificate is registered with the Civil Register so
much so that the above-mentioned presumption is made to apply, the Court had
occasion to state that this presumption “is merely disputable and will have to
yield to more positive evidence establishing their inaccuracy" [<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">.] </span>Here, private respondent's witness, <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>,
was able to show by testimony that Cesar Rivera died from an accident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apropos is the statement of the Court of Appeals, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">mere </span>fact that
the cause of death written on the Certificate of Death (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"E") is "myocardial Infarction" does not effectively negate
the insurance claim under consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It did not rule out the plausibility of appellant's theory that the real
and proximate cause of death was said accident inflicting the head wounds <span class="SpellE">referrd</span> (sic) to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, the probability of a heart attack which contributed to the passing away
of the late Cesar Rivera is not discounted but even such supervening event
could be categorized as work connected and did not render the latter's demise
outside the coverage and protection of the insurance contract. . . . [CA
Decision, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">3; </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further relies on the International Certificate for
Transportation of Cadavers [Annex "B"] issued by the Ministry of
Health of Iraq through a certain Dr. F.J. <span class="SpellE">Jurji</span>
wherein it is stated that Cesar Rivera died on March 23, 1982 due to myocardial
infarction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this piece of
evidence cannot be utilized to establish the cause of death of private
respondent's husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is clearly
provided in said certificate that the same is issued only to secure the
transportation of the corpse of Cesar Rivera.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither could petitioner Stronghold rely on the NBI Exhumation
Report [Annex "G"] to support its claim that the cause of death of
Cesar Rivera is myocardial infarction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, the body of the deceased was exhumed and autopsied by the NBI
to establish the cause of death of Cesar Rivera.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is bolstered by the fact that in the
Exhumation Report, myocardial infarction was listed only as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">alleged</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>cause
of death <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the </span>deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">NBI's</span>
finding with respect to the fractured ribs suffered by the deceased is more
compatible with <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> Rivera's theory that her
husband's death was caused by his<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>accidental
fall.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the Court finds that respondent Court of Appeals did not
err in its appreciation of evidence in favor of private respondent and, hence,
it committed no reversible error in reversing the decision of the Insurance
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner Stronghold raises as an error respondent
court's award of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It contends that there is <span class="GramE">no
basis for such award as it "did <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not

entitled to attorney's fees.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent is of the view that P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> award of attorney's fees is "so minimal and it
