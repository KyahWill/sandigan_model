				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue posed in this case is whether or not a party who failed
to appeal from a decision of the labor arbiter to the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC) within the ten (10) day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period can still participate in a separate appeal timely interposed by the
adverse party by filing a motion for reconsideration of a decision of the NLRC
on such appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was recruited as a laborer by private respondents <span class="SpellE">Requito</span> Vega, Antonio Gomez and Belen Gomez, who are the
owners of Vega &amp; Co., a private recruitment agency, with assignment at

</span>Sometime on <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1984</st1:date>,
he was allegedly summarily dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1986</st1:date>,
he filed a complaint for reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
with Region X of the Department of Labor and Employment in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1986</st1:date>,
the labor arbiter ordered all parties to submit their position papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only petitioner complied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1986</st1:date>, petitioner filed an urgent motion that the failure of

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1987</st1:date>,
the labor arbiter rendered a decision ordering private respondents to jointly

computed at one month for every year of service <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">within </span>the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner appealed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

respondents also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">appealed but </span>it
was filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 26, 1988, the Second Division of the NLRC promulgated a
decision modifying the appealed decision in that respondent PKI was ordered to
reinstate petitioner to his former position without loss of seniority rights
and other accrued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">benefits </span>and
with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the time of dismissal up to
his actual reinstatement, and in case reinstatement is impossible, payment of
full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and separation pay of one (1) month
salary for every year of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appeal of respondent PKI was dismissed for having been filed out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PKI allegedly received a copy of the decision of the NLRC
only on <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration of said decision
dated September 22, 1988 was filed by said respondent and a similar motion was
filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by <span class="SpellE">Samahang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kabuhayan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Luz <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> (SKLB for

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1988</st1:date>,
a resolution was promulgated by the same division of the NLRC, setting aside
its decision and dismissing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>case
for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration thereof filed by petitioner who besides questioning its
findings of acts raised the issue that said respondent’s appeal having been
filed out of time its motion for reconsideration of the decision should not
have been entertained as it raised issues for the first on appeal which were
not r<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a</span>ised before the labor
arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied on <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third and fourth assignment of errors shall first be
resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that private respondents failed to file a
timely appeal from the decision of the labor arbiter while the petitioner was
able to interpose his appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also an accepted postulate
that issues not raised in the lower court or the labor arbiter may not be
raised for the first time on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Note is taken of the fact
that even the Solicitor General refused to represent the NLRC in this
proceeding as it shares the view of petitioner that the decision of the labor
arbiter </span>having <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">become final by
the failure to respondent PKI to appeal on time the NLRC may no longer amend,
modify, much less set aside the same.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This posture is correct insofar as respondent PKI is
concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as petitioner had
filed a timely appeal the NLRC had jurisdiction to give due course to his
appeal and render the decision of <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="8">August
 28, 1988</st1:date>, a copy of which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>furnished respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having lost the right to appeal can
respondent PKI file a motion for reconsideration of said decision?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court resolves the question in the
affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rules of technicality <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">must yield to the broader interest of
justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only by giving due course
to the motion for reconsideration that was timely filed that the NLRC may be
able to equitably evaluate the conflicting versions of facts presented by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the now questioned resolution of the NLRC dated <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1988</st1:date>, the following
findings and conclusions were made:</p>

<blockquote>“Respondent SKLB assails the finding of this Commission that it is
engaged in labor-only contracting. In support thereof, respondent submitted a
Clearance Certificate issued by the Department of Labor and Employment,
Regional Office No. 10 situated in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City, certifying to its being cleared for issuance of a
permit as a labor contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also
submitted payrolls showing that it indeed operated as such independent labor
contractor in accordance with Article 106 of the Labor Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Attached to respondent <span class="SpellE">SKLB’s</span> motion
likewise is the joint affidavit of one Mario T. <span class="SpellE">Ecarnum</span>
and Benito U. <span class="SpellE">Ecarnum</span> who jointly stated that they
were neighbors and co-workers of the complainant in the pit burning area, in a
work contracted by aforesaid respondent with respondent <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Kao, Inc.; that complainant abandoned his work starting April 19, 1984 when he
went to Manila to apply for work abroad and it was only about eight (8) months
later that he returned when he failed to secure an overseas employment; that
complainant’s prolonged absence was without prior permission or leave of
absence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent SKLB further contends that it meets all requirements set
by law and jurisprudence pertaining to an independent labor contractor, citing
the case of <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
vs. Workmen’s Compensation Commission, 97 SCRA 255, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘An independent contractor is one who, in rendering services,
exercise an independent employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>occupation
and represents the will of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span>employer
only as to the results of his work; and who is engaged to perform a certain
service to another according to his own manner and methods, free from control
and direction of his employer in all matters connected with the performance of
the service, except as to the result of the work.’</p>

<blockquote>To further buttress respondent <span class="SpellE">SKLB’s</span>
claim of being an independent labor contractor and employer of complainant, it
submitted a copy of a Memorandum dated <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="4">April
 21, 1984</st1:date> sent to complainant requiring the latter to report to its
office immediately otherwise he would be deemed to have abandoned his work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It does strike Us as odd that if indeed complainant was dismissed
sometime in April 1984 it took him <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">almost
</span>three (3) <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">years </span>before
filing the instant case for illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This circumstance adds a significant dimension to respondent’s position
that indeed complainant abandoned his job to look for greener pastures and it
was only when he failed to find such opportunity that he came back to demand
that he be allowed to resume the employment which he unceremoniously abandoned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All the foregoing undisputed circumstances, taken together,
preponderate in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">SKLB’s</span> claim of
being a lawful independent labor contractor which employed complainant who
unjustifiably abandoned his employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision sought to be reconsidered is hereby SET
ASIDE and a new one entered, dismissing the case for lack of merit.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
