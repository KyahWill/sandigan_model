 20, 1989</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="10">October 31,
 1989</st1:date> of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which
affirmed with modification the earlier decision of Labor Arbiter Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Libron</span>, Labor Arbitration Branch, <span class="GramE">Regional</span>
Office No. XI, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City and ordered the petitioner
to pay the members of respondent Associated Labor Unions (ALU) monthly living
allowance differentials pursuant to the provisions of Wage Order No. 6 and its
implementing rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Associated Labor Unions (ALU) is the exclusive
bargaining agent of the on-and-off rank and file workers as well as the monthly
paid employees of petitioner Terminal Facilities and Services Corporation
(TEFASCO), a domestic corporation engaged in the business of wharf services and
facilities operating for profit and with business operation located at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the ground that petitioner TEFASCO failed to comply with the
law on the payment of the mandated cost of living allowance under existing wage
order to its monthly-paid employees who are members of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">respondent </span>ALU, the latter, in a complaint dated September 5,
1985 filed with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) Labor
Arbitration Branch, Regional Office No. XI, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
charged the former with underpayment of emergency cost of living allowance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent ALU alleged that petitioner TEFASCO pays each
monthly-paid employee only P455.00 a month as emergency cost of living
allowance which is less than the prescribed amount of P517.08 per month as
stated in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the table of computations
released by the Ministry (now <span class="GramE">Department) of Labor and
Employment.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ALU filed the
complaint after TEFASCO refused to adjust the union members' allowances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its position paper, petitioner TEFASCO traversed the
allegations in the complaint by stating that the covered employees belong to
Group II under the table of computations which includes establishments that
consider rest days as <span class="SpellE">unworked</span> and unpaid and not
under Group III as alleged in the complaint which includes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">establishments that consider rest days and
holidays as paid days although <span class="SpellE">unworked</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner explained that the basis of
the computation of the basic wages allowance is 26 days per month for monthly
paid employees, the four (4) rest days excluded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, petitioner TEFASCO averred that
its stand is in consonance with Section 5 of the Implementing Rules of Wage No.

<blockquote>"<u>Allowance</u> <u>for</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Unworked</u></span>

wage even if <span class="SpellE">unworked</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

their rest days and holidays, although <span class="SpellE">unworked</span>, are
being considered paid upon which their monthly allowance should be based.</blockquote>

so far <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>it categorized the
union members receiving a basic salary of P1<span class="GramE">,095.00</span> as

<p class="BODY">Under the table of computations an employee who receives a basic

the salary for one-half month is P529.50.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

</span><span class="GramE">Because the salary equivalent to one (1) day absence

<blockquote>"One strong argument in favor of the petitioner's stand is the
fact that the Chartered Bank, in computing overtime compensation for its
employees, employs a 'divisor' of 251 days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 251 working days divisor is the result of subtracting all Saturdays,
Sundays and the ten (10) legal holidays from the total number of calendar days
in a year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the employees are already
paid for all non-working days, the divisor should be 365 and not 251.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The situation is muddled
somewhat by the fact that, in computing the employees' absences from work, the
respondent bank uses 365 as divisor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any
slight doubts, however, must be resolved in favor of the workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is in keeping with the constitutional
mandate of promoting </span>social <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">justice
</span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">affording protection to

provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules and regulations,
shall be resolved in favor of labor.'</p>

<blockquote>Any remaining doubts which may arise from the conflicting or
different divisors used in the computation of overtime pay and employees'
absences are resolved by the manner in which work actually rendered on holidays
is paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, whenever monthly paid
employees work on a holiday, they are given an additional 100% base pay on top
of a premium pay of 50%.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the <span class="GramE">employees</span> monthly pay already includes their salaries for
holidays, they should be paid only premium pay but not both base pay and
premium pay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The contention of the respondent that 100% base pay and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">50% </span>premium pay for work actually
rendered on holidays is given in addition to monthly salaries only because the
collective bargaining agreement so provides is itself an argument in favor of
the petitioner's stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It shows that
the Collective Bargaining Agreement already contemplated a divisor of 251 days
for holiday pay computations before the questioned presumption in the
Integrated Rules and the Policy Instruction was formulated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is furthermore a similarity between
overtime pay, which is computed on the basis of 251 working days a year, and
holiday pay, which should be similarly treated notwithstanding the public
respondents' issuances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In both
cases--overtime work and holiday work--the employee works when he is supposed
to be resting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of an
express provision of the CBA or the law to the contrary, the computations
should be similarly handled.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are not unmindful of the fact that the respondent's employees
are among the highest paid in the industry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">is </span>not the intent of
this Court to impose any undue burdens on an employer which is already doing
its best for its personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we
have to resolve the labor dispute in the light of the parties' own collective
bargaining agreement and the benefits given by law to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">all</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

provides benefits for ‘employees in all establishments and undertakings,

those benefits, the administrative agency implementing that law cannot exclude
certain employees from its coverage simply because they are paid by the month
or because they are already highly paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The remedy lies in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a clear </span>redrafting

<p class="BODY">As can be gleaned from the disquisition, the decision in favor of
the association was arrived at based on the divisor of 251 days which was

<p class="BODY">We, however, do not find any application as regards the divisor
of 251 days or less than 365 days in the instant case to determine the monthly
cost of living allowance provided for in Wage Order No. 6 "increasing the
statutory minimum wage rates and cost of living allowances in the private
sector." The cited case is not similar to the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">case in </span>that, first, the former

the employees provided for in the parties' collective bargaining agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">What is clear is that the
petitioner in line with company practice uses the divisor of 26 days per month

labor contract which deserves special treatment and a liberal interpretation in

General observes in his Comment supporting the petitioner, the Constitution
mandates the protection of labor and the sympathetic concern of the State for
the working class <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">conformably to the
social justice policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a command

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The paramount duty of this
Court is to render justice through law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The law in this case allows two opposite interpretations, one strictly
in favor of the employers and the other liberally in favor of the worker. The
choice is obvious. We find, considering the totality of the circumstances
attending this case, that the petitioner is entitled to relief."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the employee in the private sector.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In

Ministry of Labor and Employment released a table of computations to guide the
employer on the amount of the cost of living allowance which a group of
employees should receive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is to be noted that the petitioner is not

he incurs absences during the period does not mean that the same procedure
should also be followed in determining the monthly cost of living allowance due
the employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any
