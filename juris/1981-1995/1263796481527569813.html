on the probability that a losing party might nurture at the back of his mind
the thought that the judge had <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriously</span> tilted
the scales of justice against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
passion on the part of a judge may be generated because of serious charges of
misconduct against him by a suitor or his counsel, is not altogether
remote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is a man, subject to the
frailties of other men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He should,
therefore, exercise great care and caution before making up his mind to act or
withdraw from a suit where that party or counsel is involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could in good grace inhibit himself where
that case could be heard by another judge and where no appreciable prejudice
would be occasioned to others involved thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

great extent that all-important confidence in the impartiality of the <span class="GramE">judiciary.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If after
reflection he should resolve to voluntarily desist from sitting in a case where
his motives or fairness might be seriously impugned, his action is to be
interpreted as giving meaning and substance to the second paragraph of Section
1, Rule 137.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He serves the cause of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We repeat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are certain circumstances when a case
could well be heard by another judge and no appreciable prejudice would be

to be the better course of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

judge's disqualification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here, a judge
voluntarily inhibits himself and, instead of a party or both parties filing a
