A prosecution for rape invariably elicits the sympathy of this Court for
 the complainant, much more so when she is quite young. That is to be 
expected for, if proven, the assault on the dignity and honor of a human
 being is not to be tolerated or countenanced. It calls for severe 
condemnation. For such a complaint, however, to prosper and the accused 
to be convicted, the law - and quite rightly at that - expects proof of 
the most satisfactory character. In the decision rendered a day ago by 
this Court, People v. Bihasa,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  the opinion being penned by Justice Gutierrez, Jr., there is this 
terse but accurate summation of the prevailing doctrine: "The crime of 
rape is not to be presumed. Consent, and not physical force, is the 
common origin of the acts between man and woman. The moral conviction 
that may serve as basis of a finding of guilt in criminal cases is that 
which is the logical and inevitable result of the evidence on record, 
exclusive of any consideration. Short of this, it is not only the right 
of the accused to be freed, it is even more our constitutional duty to 
acquit him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
<p>
It is from that standpoint that this appeal from a conviction of rape 
must be judged. The plight of complainant Alicia Benitag is, of course, 
to be deplored. Nonetheless, a searching and careful study of the 
eviÂ­dence of record cannot justify a finding of guilt. The requisite 
standard for such a conclusion has not been met; the constitutional 
presumption of innocence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  has not been overcome. As will be explained, the conviction cannot be sustained.
</p><p>
We start with the evidence as offered by the complainant herself. 
Complainant, then fifteen years of age, having been born on November 28,
 1961,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  was at Daraga Church on the evening of October 20, 1976.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  She attended mass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  She was in an unhappy frame of mind, feeling deeply hurt by the scolding of her parents early that morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  She left her house to go to the Divine Word High School where she was a student, but she did not even take her lunch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  She stayed until about 5:30 in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  She then went to the Daraga Church.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  Feeling still quite depressed, she entertained thoughts of committing suicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  Fortunately, there was an elderly man who on noticing her troubled 
state of mind, advised her against it because it is a bad thing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  His words caused her to go back to church to pray.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  When she left the church, two men, whom she noticed eyeing her earlier, followed her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  They asked for her name; she did not answer, for they were strangers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  She did not know them. She later found out that they were Romeo Paleza and Charlie Agripa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  She went back to church. Then, after awhile, she left. The two pulled her, one on each hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  They told her not to shout, because if she shouted they will kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  It was appellant Charlie Agripa who made the warning or threat, which filled her with fear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  They kept pulling her towards the back of a big house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  One of them, Romeo Paleza, said that she should sleep in the house because he has also a sister there and his mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  She did not agree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  She was pulled to a place where there are banana plants and grasses, the distance of which is about 20 to 30 meters away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  While Paleza was removing his tee-shirt she ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  He chased her and was able to catch up with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  He kept on kissing her. He told her to sit down, and when she did not, he pushed her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  That caused her to assume a sitting position, unable to stand up as he held her shoulders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  He then pushed her anew, as a result of which she fell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  She was about to shout, but he warned her that he would kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  She tried to avoid his kisses by moving her head right and left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  Making use of his strength, he was able to lay her flat on her back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  She kept on kicking him, but to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  He pulled her clothes upward.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  He was thus able to disrobe her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  She kept on resisting, but he finally succeeded in having sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> 
</p><p>
As testified to by complainant, after such assault, she was left alone 
by Paleza, who told her to sleep in a big house near the church.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  She tried to escape because she was afraid that something else could happen to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  She was unable to do so as she was pursued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
  She fell down on a sitting position on the ground, and then appellant 
Agripa held her right hand to push her towards what she called the big 
house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  Again, she was able to escape momentarily, but again she was caught.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Then she was pushed inside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  Appellant closed the door and for sometime waited outside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  She tried to open the door, but she could not, because he [Agripa] was still there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  When asked what she did, her answer was: "I was not able to shout because if I did he will kill me."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  When asked what she did later, her reply was: "At that time, I was already very tired, and I fell asleep in the house."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  When she "woke up, [appellant] was already on top of [her]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  He was "doing the sexual act."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  She "pushed him away, but she could not."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  Then the next question was: "What transpired after that?" Her response: "He left me suddenly."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  When she was certain he was no longer there, she went back to the Daraga Church about midnight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  As there was nobody inside, she just sat on a bench outside until 4:00 o'clock of the next morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  A <em>sacristan </em>approached her and called for a madre.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  Then she went to the convento where she was questioned by a madre.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  She stayed there until 11:00 o'clock. At that time, her father came and took her back to the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  She was taken to a clinic at Daraga and was given a medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>
  The medical certificate showed the following findings: "1. Hymen - not
 intact, presence of old lacerations, no fresh bleeding noted. 2. 
Introitus - right side, the presence of contusions, 1 cm. in its widest 
diameter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  On 
cross-examination, when counsel for the appellant asked whether she 
could not sleep, as she was afraid, this was her answer: "I fell asleep 
because I was already tired."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>
  She was likewise asked whether it was a fact that when appellant was 
on top of her what she did was to embrace him, and her answer was no.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the appealed decision, the above testimony of complainant was 
summarized. Then, reference was made to two other prosecution witnesses,
 Faustino Llanto and Teofilo Adlawan, who "did not help much the case of
 the prosecution. Llanto denied having seen any rape. Adlawan only 
corroborated Alicia Benitag's testimony as to how she was brought in the
 ground floor of the big house. He knocked at the door of said house but
 Charlie Agripa told him not to get inside as there was a person inside.
 Adlawan took Alicia to the sisters the early morning but she refused to
 eat."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  The other 
prosecution witness, Francisco Benitag, the father of complainant, "only
 testified as to how he found her daughter upon being called by the 
parish priest of Daraga, Albay."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  It was he who signed the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> 
</p><p>
As for the defense, the decision of the lower court had the following to
 say: "The prosecution having rested, Charlie Agripa took the witness 
stand. He denied having had any sexual intercourse with Alicia Benitag 
that night of October 20, 1976, although he admitted that he saw Alicia 
Benitag in the ground floor of the house of Harry Guevarra that evening 
when Faustino Llanto told Mrs. Harry Guevarra of her presence, as she 
was asking to be allowed to sleep that evening in the house, which was 
refused. So she left with her companions, Romeo Palez (sic) and Teofilo 
Adlawan. Charlie Agripa asserted that he works with the Guevarras and in
 the early morning of October 20, 1976, he was packing abaca products up
 to 12:00 P.M. which were to be shipped urgently the following day."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  Insofar as the testimony made as to his hours of work, it was, according to the decision, "substantially corroborated"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>
  by witness Editha Red for the defense. Also, "she claimed that a 
certain female wanted to sleep that evening in the house per information
 given by Llanto; she did not herself go down to see her. Editha 
testified that Charlie slept near the door of the sala by the garage on 
the second floor of the house and he did not go down, [an assumption 
based on] Editha [having] slept at 1:00 A.M. already (sic)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> 
</p><p>
The lower court made clear that its conclusion that the guilt of the 
accused had been proven arose from its being "fully persuaded by 
Alicia's narrative that when she woke up she found Charlie Agripa on top
 of her and thru threat of death, despite her resistance, was able to 
have carnal knowledge of her."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>
  As previously stated, complainant's testimony, considered with other 
relevant facts, does not suffice, in the opinion of the Court, to 
overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence. Hence the 
reversal.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  Appellant, as noted at the outset, invoked the constitutional 
presumption of innocence, the evidence against him, according to his 
counsel, not satisfying the requirement that it should be beyond 
reasonable doubt. In support of such a proposition, he assigned as 
errors the fact that the lower court ought to have given credence to the
 uncorroborated testimony of complainant which was characterized by 
glaring contradictions, hence inconclusive and improbable; in not taking
 into account the testimony of the attending physician who admitted 
during the trial that she failed to see any contusions, hematoma, 
bruises or indications in the person of complainant to indicate the use 
of force; in not giving credence to the testimony of prosecution 
witness, Faustino Llanto, who testified that accused-appellant did not 
rape the offended party. It is his submission then that appellant ought 
to have been acquitted.
  </p>
  <p> 2.  According to the records of the case, on June 8, 1977, an 
information was filed by Provincial Fiscal Juan C. Salazar charging 
appellant and a certain Romeo Paleza of the crime of rape, such 
information in effect reiterating the allegations of the complaint filed
 by her father on October 28, 1976 that both appellant Charlie Agripa 
and a certain Romeo Paleza, "conniving and confederating [with] one 
another for a common purpose, with lewd designs and with the use of 
force, threats, intimidation and trickery,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>  did rape appellant, then fifteen years of age.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  The arraignment was set for October 5, 1977, with both accused pleading not guilty to the information for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>
  Then on October 25, 1977, the accused Romeo Paleza, assisted by his 
counsel, Attorney Romeo Ricafort, asked the lower court to withdraw his 
original plea of not guilty in order that he may plead guilty to the 
lesser offense of simple seduction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>
 He accepted full responsibility for the sexual intercourse with 
comÂ­plainant which, according to him, was committed "with the offended 
party voluntarily."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> He 
was, therefore, found guilty of the offense of simple seduction. There 
was no change of heart on the part of appellant, and the case against 
him proceeded. It is worth noting that when complainant testified, she 
was quite categoÂ­rical in saying that after she left the church, two men
 followed her, neither one of whom she knew. She was referring to 
appellant and Paleza. From the decision of the lower court convicting 
the latter, however, of simple seduction, it would appear that her 
statement, to say the least, was grossly inaccurate as to Paleza. </p>
  <p>
    4.  It cannot escape notice likewise that the detailed testimony of 
complainant always referred to both Paleza and appellant acting in 
concert. They pulled her; they threatened her; they led her towards the 
big house, later on identified as belonging to a certain Harry Guevarra,
 where appellant was working.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>  In her testimony, however, she was quite categorical that Paleza said such house belonged to his mother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>
 and that he had a sister there. The carnal act with Paleza, however, 
took place outside such house in a place "where there were banana plants
 and grasses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>  Prior to such occurrence, Paleza told appellant to leave, and he did so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    5.  It should not also escape notice as to how complainant narrated 
the occurrence of her being raped. In the case of Paleza, thirty-six 
questions covering three and one-half pages of the stenographic notes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>
 were asked. Complainant, therefore, could answer in a manner both 
explicit and graphic as to how she was compelled to submit through force
 to his desires. NoneÂ­theless, her detailed version could hardly be 
considered accurate considering that Paleza was convicted of simple 
seduction. To repeat, contrary to her assertion then, he was not a 
stranger. Seduction presupposes at the very least that the culprit must 
have been known by the victim. On the other hand, as far as appellant is
 concerned, what is readily noticeable is that only twelve questions 
were asked on direct examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  What is worse, only three questions dealt precisely with the fact of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> First she was asked, after falling asleep, when she did wake up. Her answer was that "he was already on top of [her]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> That "he", in her answer to the next question, was appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>
 When she was asked what he was doing, this was her answer: "He was 
already doing the sexual act with me and I had no more panties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>
  On cross-examination, as noted earlier, when she was asked whether it 
was a fact that when appellant was on top of her what she did was to 
embrace him, her answer was in the negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>
 That was all. Comparing such inÂ­conclusive testimony, in effect 
adducing a conclusion rather than stating a fact, there is 
highly-persuasive force to the contention of appellant that no rape was 
committed. </p>
  <p> 6.  In the appealed decision of the lower court, the testimony of 
witness Editha Red, for the defense, to the effect that a certain female
 who turned out to be the complainant wanted to sleep that evening in 
the house of the Guevarras, was given credence by the lower court. 
Further, according to the lower court decision: "She [complainant] did 
not even know Charlie Agripa [appellant] whom she accidentally 
encountered near the Daraga church the evening of October 20, 1976. She 
had no place to go and sought shelter in the big house, in the ground 
floor of the house of Harry Guevarra, where only Charlie Agripa and an 
old man were."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Since, as 
made clear in the decision that the case against appellant would prosper
 or not on the credence to be accorded her testimony, it follows that 
appellant had made out a case for acquittal, his guilt not being shown 
beyond reasonable doubt. The glaring and maniÂ­fest contradictions in her
 testimony, to repeat, casts serious doubt as to the truth of her 
accusation that rape was committed. </p>
  <p> 7.  The second error assigned, based on the testiÂ­mony of the 
attending physician, Dr. Lydia Rogando, who examined the complainant, is
 to the effect that credence should have been accorded to her conclusion
 that there were "no signs of a contusion, hematoma, bruises or signs of
 finger grips when she examined complainant the next day." The medical 
certificate reads as follows: "1. Hymen - not intact, presence of old 
lacerations, no fresh bleeding noted. 2. Introitus - right side, the 
presence of contusion, 1 cm. in its widest diameter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>
 On cross-examination, however, she further clarified such report. She 
used the term "old lacerations" because "a new laceration would not look
 like that."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> She added: "It was already healed and I presumed that it healed long before my examination - probably one or 2 months before."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> She likewise admitted that she did not see "any contusion or hematoma appearing on both legs or thighs of [Alicia Benitag]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>
  Moreover, she answered affirmatively the question that if a woman were
 forced to engage in sexual intercourse, notwithstanding her refusal and
 her resistance, there would be signs of hematoma and contusion in her 
legs and thighs, which would still appear two or three days after the 
alleged commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> She answered "none" to the question: "You did not find contusion on the thighs and legs of the patient?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>  Nor was there any at the back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> When asked as to whether she found bruises, this was her reply: "Not even bruises. I did not see any."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>
  It must be remembered that she was medically examined on October 23, 
1976, three days after the occurrence of the alleged rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 8.  The third error assigned is that the testiÂ­mony of Faustino 
Llanto, an impartial prosecution witness, to the effect that the 
accused-appellant did not rape the offended party, should be given 
credence. As noted earlier, the Court itself appeared to be of the same 
mind, not only with witness Faustino Llanto, but also with witness 
Teofilo Adlawan of the proseÂ­cution. As stated in the decision: 
"Faustino Llanto and Teofilo Adlawan did not help much the case of the 
prosecution. Llanto denied having seen any rape. Adlawan only 
corroborated Alicia Benitag's testimony as to how she was brought in the
 ground floor of the big house. He knocked at the door of said house but
 Charlie Agripa told him to get inside as there was a person inside."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    9.  In the light of what has been stated before, there is no need to
 inquire as to the defense of alibi. The conviction must rest on the 
strength of the evidence for the prosecution, not on the weakness of the
 testimony of the defense. To warrant conviction, proof beyond 
reasonable doubt must be established by the State. In the absence of 
such a showing, the constitutional presumption of innocence stands in 
the way of a finding of guilt. Reversal of the judgment of the appealed 
decision is thus indicated.
  </p>
  <p>
    10.This opinion may fitly close with this excerpt from the recent decision in People v. Gabiana:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>
 "The fundamental right to the presumption of innocence calls for the 
utmost respect. So it has been the consistent ruling of this Court. It 
follows, to paraphrase People v. Dramayo, that accusation may not be 
equated with guilt. The prosecution must successfully discharge the 
burden of proof that the offense had been committed and the person 
responsible for that commission is the accused. The standard has always 
been proof beyond reasonable doubt. That goes back to the 1903 decision 
of United States v. Reyes. While absolute certainty is not demanded by 
law for the conviction to be sustained, 'moral certainty,' in the 
language of United States v. Lasada, 'is required, and this certainty is
 required as to every proposition of proof requisite to constitute the 
offense.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the decision is reversed and the defendant-appellant is 
acquitted. His immediate release is ordered unless there is valid legal 
cause for his continued detention. No costs.
