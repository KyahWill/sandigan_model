Automatic review of the decision of the then Court of First Instance of 
Quezon (Criminal Case No. 2365) convicting herein accused Antonio 
Benaraba, Cesar Benaraba and Virgilio Benaraba for multiple murder and 
sentencing them to the supreme penalty of "death by electrocution; to 
indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of Danilo, Ernesto, Gil and 
Henry, all surnamed de Leon, in the total amount of Forty Eight Thousand
 Pesos (P48,000.00), but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency; and, with costs de oficio."
<p>
The case against Cesar Benaraba was dismissed by this Court in a resolutions, dated February 15, 1979, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "L-32865 (People vs. Antonio Benaraba, et al.). -Considering the 
letter dated December 12, 1978 of Pablo L. Rosales of the Bureau of 
Prisons, reporting on the death of the accused-appellant Cesar Benaraba 
and the comment thereto of the Solicitor General, filed in compliance 
with the resolution of January 16, 1979, interposing no objection to the
 dismissal of the appeal insofar as the criminal liability of the 
deceased accused is concerned, but stating that the civil indemnity 
which was adjudged against him by the lower court should survive for 
final disposition by this Court, the Court Resolved to DISMISS the case 
against appellant Cesar Benaraba but only insofar as his criminal 
liability is concerned, without prejudice to his civil liability." (p. 
302, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Likewise, the case against Antonio Benaraba was dismissed in a resolution by the Court en banc, dated April 14, 1983:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "L-32865 (People vs. Antonio Benaraba, et al.). - Acting on the 
comment of the Solicitor General on the letter dated February 22, 1983 
of the Acting Director of Prisons, informing this Court of the death of 
accused-appellant Antonio Benaraba, the Court Resolved to DISMISS this 
case with respect to said accused-appellant Antonio Benaraba." (p. 326, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, the case against Cesar Benaraba and Antonio Benaraba having been dismissed, this appeal concerns Virgilio Benaraba only.
</p><p>
Prosecution evidence shows that Marcialito de Leon of barrio Caglate, 
Alabat, Quezon borrowed from spouses Fidel Benaraba and wife, also of 
the same barrio, the sum of P1,165.30.  It was their understanding that 
should de Leon fail to pay the debt he would sell his parcel of land to 
Fidel Benaraba and wife.  The agreement was reduced in writing, signed 
in the presence of Fidel's sons namely:  appellants Antonio Benaraba, 
Cesar Benaraba and Virgilio Benaraba.
</p><p>
De Leon failed to pay his indebtedness and when he did not sell his 
property to Fidel Benaraba as had been agreed upon, the latter was 
prompted to file a complaint for estafa against him.  However, the 
estafa case was dismissed upon motion of the prosecution because the 
land was still in the possession of the complaining witness and no sale 
of the same was made to another person and the further fact that Fidel 
Benaraba failed to appear in court despite due notice.
</p><p>
Thereafter, Fidel Benaraba filed a tenancy case against de Leon with the
 then Court of Agrarian Relations.  During the pendency of the CAR case,
 appellant Antonio Benaraba happened to meet Marcialito de Leon in the 
poblacion of Alabat, Quezon and in a threatening manner, Antonio told 
Marcialito that he would not stop until all the de Leons are killed.
</p><p>
On April 6, 1968, Marcialito de Leon, his wife and their two (2) 
daughters, Cerilla and Irene, were at the poblacion because the latter 
had to be treated for dislocation.  The de Leon's four (4) children, 
namely:  Danilo, 12 years old; Ernesto, 10 years old; Gil, 7 years old, 
and Henry, 5 years old were left at their house in Caglate, Alabat.
</p><p>
About six o'clock in the evening of April 6, 1968, Aniceto Cañazares 
passed by near the house of de Leon on his way home.  He saw appellants 
Antonio, Cesar and Virgilio Benaraba in front of the de Leon's house.  
They were walking in single file in a crouched position towards the de 
Leon's house and with Cesar in front, followed by Virgilio and Antonio. 
 They were about 20 meters away from the de Leon's residence.  After 
watching them for about three minutes, Aniceto Cañazares continued on 
his way home.
</p><p>
Shortly thereafter, Cesar Magsino passed by near the house of de Leon.  
From a distance, he heard the sound of children crying in agony from the
 de Leon's residence.  He went closer up to a distance of about 30 
meters to observe what was happening inside.  He stayed for sometime and
 he saw the Benaraba brothers - Antonio, Cesar and Virgilio, inside the 
house and the de Leon children crying.
</p><p>
About seven o'clock in the evening Antonio, Cesar and Virgilio left the 
house.  Magsino also left and proceeded to his house without getting 
inside the house of the de Leons to see and inquire what had happened 
because he feared the Benaraba brothers.
</p><p>
About eight o'clock in the evening, the house of the de Leons was on 
fire.  Alfredo Dequilla who lived nearby called upon his neighbors for 
help and they tried to put off the fire but failed.  After the fire had 
run its course, people found the charred dead bodies of the four 
children of Fidel de Leon, namely:  Danilo, Ernesto, Gil and Henry.
</p><p>
The bodies of the de Leon children were brought by the barrio people to 
the poblacion of Alabat, Quezon where an examination was conducted by 
Dr. Adolfo Caparas who issued the following findings:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "<em>Danilo de Leon,</em> 12 years old - </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Cause of Death:  Severe traumatic shock due to severe head injury, due to burn, severe, generalized covering whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other signs and conditions:  Forearm, amputated, right.
    </p>
    <p> Date of Death:  April 6, 1968, death occurred 8 P.M." (p. 22, tsn., October 29, 1969; Exhibit 'L', p. 30, Records). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <em>Ernesto de Leon,</em> 10 years old –
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Cause of Death:  Severe traumatic shock due to severe head injury, due to burn severe, generalized, covering whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Date of Death:  April 6, 1968, death occurred 8 PM (p. 22, tsn., Ibid; Exhibit 'm', p. 31 Records).
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <em>Gil de Leon</em>, 6 years old –
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Cause of Death:  Severe burns, generalized, covering whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Date of Death:  April 6, 1968, death occurred 8 PM (p. 22, tsn., Ibid; Exhibit 'N', p. 32, Records).
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <em>Henry de Leon</em>, 5 years old –
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Cause of Death:  Severe burns, generalized, covering whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Date of Death:  April 6, 1968, death occurred 8 PM (p. 22, tsn, 
Ibid; Exhibit 'O', p. 33, Records).  (pp. 9-10, Appellee's Brief)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
At about two o'clock in the afternoon of April 7, 1968, the dead 
children of Fidel de Leon were finally laid to rest with almost one 
hundred people attended the interment.  It was noticed that no one in 
the family of the Benaraba joined the funeral.
</p><p>
On April 15, 1968, Acting Chief of Police Norberto Ramos, who personally
 went to the scene of the fire to conduct an investigation of the case, 
took the statements of Marcialito de Leon, Alfredo Dequilla and Pablo 
Verzo.  Spouses Fidel and Gregoria and the three accused were summoned 
for the purpose of taking their statements but all of them except 
Antonio refused to sign any statement.
</p><p>
During the investigation, Acting Chief Ramos observed that Fidel and his
 wife wanted to say something but were ashamed.  Hence, Acting Chief 
Ramos brought them at the back of the municipal building where Fidel 
pleaded for help in the case and offered him a cow.  Believing that it 
would help solve the case, he agreed.  Fidel promised to deliver the 
money at the wharf.  Thereafter, he went to the Municipal Judge and 
informed the latter that Fidel had offered him a bribe.  He also 
informed Acting Mayor Renato Baldovino about the offer but the latter 
told him not to push through his plan.  Later, said Acting Mayor went to
 the house of Benaraba.  One and half hour after, the acting mayor 
informed him that the reason why Fidel and his wife offered bribe was 
because they were afraid.
</p><p>
Despite the reason relayed by the acting mayor to Acting Chief Ramos, an
 attempted bribery case was still filed by the Philippine Constabulary 
against Fidel Benaraba, but the same was provisionally dismissed for 
lack of interest on the part of the prosecution.
</p><p>
An autopsy of the exhumed bodies of Danilo, Ernesto, Gil and Henry was 
made.  The Medical Necropsy Reports of Col. Zarraga read as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "FOR DANILO DE LEON - </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Pertinent findings:  Portions of the left frontal and temporal 
bones are fractured extending to the right parietal, temporal and 
frontal bone, causing a filling defect of the skull (See attached 
anatomical outline with measurements indicated).
    </p>
    <p>
        Advanced decomposition has softened most of the internal organs.
  There is also a filling defect on the external region of the chest.
    </p>
    <p> Remarks:  The body is charred to such extent that ante-mortem 
traumatic injuries could be possible in the case" (pp. 3-4, tsn., Ibid: 
Exhibits 'G', 'G-1', pp. 246-247, Records). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "FOR ERNESTO DE LEON - </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Pertinent findings:  Portions of the left parietal, temporal and
 frontal bones are fractured and extending to the right parietal, 
frontal and temporal bones, producing a filling defect of the skull as 
indicated in the attached anatomical outline with the measurements 
indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Advanced decomposition has softened most of the internal organs 
that no traumatic injuries could be established from a study of the 
internal organs.
    </p>
    <p> Remarks:  The body is charred to such an extent that ante-mortem
 injuries could be possible in this case" (pp. 5-6, tsn., Ibid; Exhibits
 'I'. 'I-1', pp. 242-243, Records). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    FOR GIL DE LEON -
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Pertinent findings:  A portion of the left parietal bone is

definite traumatic injuries to the same could be established.
    </p>
    <p> Remarks:  The body is charred to such extent that ante-mortem 
injuries could be possible in this case " (p. 6, tsn., Ibid; Exhibits 
'J', 'J-1', pp. 240-­241, Records). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    FOR HENRY DE LEON -
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Pertinent findings:  Portions of the left frontal, parietal and 
occi­pital bones are fractured extending over to almost the whole left 
side, leaving portions of the left frontal, temporal and occipetal 
bones, causing a large filling defect of the skull (See attached 
anatomical outline with measurements indicated). </p>
    <p> Right femur is fractured at the distal third.  Trachea and 
internal organs are undergoing advanced de­composition and softening and
 there is a large filling defect of the sternum and ribs anteriorly. </p>
    <p> Remarks:  The body is charred to such extent that ante-mortem 
traumatic injuries could be possible in this case" (pp. 4-5, tsn., Ibid;
 Exhibits 'H', 'H-1', pp. 244-245, Records).  (pp. 13-14, Appellee's 
Brief) </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Considering the injuries suffered by these little ones, particularly 
their fractured skulls, it is no wonder that they were not able to run 
away from a burning house.  In fact, they would have died even if the 
house was not set on fire.
</p><p>
The defense asserts that neither Fidel nor his three sons were angry at 
Marcialito de Leon and his family, otherwise they would have taken the 
law in their own hands instead of filing estafa and tenancy cases 
against them; that before and during the fire, the three accused were 
all in the house of Eutiquio Morada at barrio Rizal, Perez, Quezon 
attending the reading of the Passion of Christ or "Pabasa" from late 
afternoon of April 6, 1968 until the following day; that it was 
physically impossible for Aniceto Cañazares and Cesar Magsino to have 
seen them immediately before the incident and during the precise moment 
when the children's agonizing voices were heard because there were thick
 underbush and obstructions consisting of citrus trees, banana hills, 
madre cacao and other plants between the barrio trail and the house of 
Marcialito; and, that the Medico Legal Necropsy Reports and the Death 
Certificates of the victims do not even state the exact causes of death.
</p><p>
Accused Antonio, Cesar and Virgilio were thereafter charged with Multiple Murder in an information as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The undersigned Provincial Fiscal, accuses ANTONIO BENARABA, 
CESAR BENARABA and VIRGILIO BENARABA of the crime of Multiple Murder, 
defined and punished under Article 248, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal
 Code, committed as follows: </p>
  <p> "That on or about the 6th day of April 1968, in the Municipality 
of Alabat, Province of Quezon, Philippines and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused with the intent to kill 
and with evident premeditation and treachery, conspiring and 
confederating together and mutually helping each other, armed with bolo 
and blunt instrument, did then and there, wilfully, unlaw­fully and 
feloniously attack, assault and wound DANILO DE LEON, ERNESTO DE LEON, 
GIL DE LEON and HENRY DE LEON in the different parts of their bodies, 
thereby inflicting upon the latters several mortal wounds and burned the
 victims inside their house which cause their instant death. </p>
  <p> "That in the commission of the above-described crime, the 
aggravating circumstance of nighttime and inundation of burning the 
victims are present." (p. 200, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After going over the records of the case We find no reason to disturb 
the finding of the trial court that Virgilio Benaraba is guilty of the 
crime for which he has been charged and convicted.  Cesar Magsino 
categorically and positively identified him and his two brothers as the 
persons who were inside the house of the de Leons when the children 
Danilo, Ernesto, Gil and Henry were crying.  Hereunder, is the testimony
 of Cesar Magsino on this point:
</p><blockquote>

The claim of the defense that appellant and his brothers were not angry 
at the de Leons is hard to believe.  The fact is, Marcialito de Leon had
 offered his land for sale to Fidel Benaraba who advanced the total sum 
of P1,165.30 but, despite the agreement, De Leon sold the property to 
Leon Caparros and did not return the money to Benaraba.  As a 
consequence, Fidel Benaraba filed a estafa case against Marcialito de 
Leon with the then Court of First Instance, but it was dismissed.  
Thereafter, a case was filed with the Court of Agrarian Relations to 
recover cost of improve­ment and labor performed on De Leon's property. 
 Fidel Benaraba even testified that his family and that of the de Leons 
were very close.  In fact, the de Leon children used to stay at their 
house and were entrusted to their care.  It is therefore unnatural if 
they did harbor no grudge or ill-feeling against the latter for what 
they had allegedly done.  Thus, it is clear there was reason for the 
Benarabas to take vengeance against the de Leons.
</p><p>
Prosecution witness Cesar Magsino saw Virgilio and his brothers inside 
the house of the de Leons that afternoon of April 6, 1968.  While it is 
true that Magsino did not enter to see what happened, he satisfactorily 
explained that he was afraid of the Benarabas.
</p><p>
For the defense of alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that the 
accused was somewhere when the crime was committed but that he must 
likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have 
been at the scene of the crime.  In the case at bar, de Leon's residence
 was about 400 meters away from Morada's house where appellant Virgilio 
and his brothers were at the time of the fire.  The distance could have 
been easily reached by walking.  Besides, the testimony of Virgilio was 
not corroborated by Morado in whose house they alleged to have stayed 
during the time of the incident.  It is surprising that not a member of 
the Benaraba family attended the funeral of the four dead innocent 
children of the de Leons.  As aptly stated by the trial court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x If according to them they never left their house from April
 6 to May 23, 1968 when arrested, why did they not even condole or 
attend the funeral of the victims as an elementary gesture of 
thoughtfulness in consonance with Filipino tradition or custom?  Did 
their conscience bother them at the sight of their ugly victims? This 
attitude militates against their denial that they were not angry at 
Marcialito.  Indeed they were not only angry, they were mad, very mad. </p>

  <p> "After considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, 
and viewing strictly the totality of the evidence on each side through 
the mirror of judicial scrutiny, like the witnesses' manner of 
testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing 
the facts to which they testify, the probability or improbability of 
their testimony, their interest or want of interest, and also their 
personal cre­dibility so far as they appeared during the trial, and 
after a deeper perspective we find the evidence for the Prosecution more
 convincing and deserving of superior weight.  The requirement of moral 
cer­tainty or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an 
unprejudiced mind has been amply shown without any iota of doubt not 
only through direct but also by circumstancial evidence." (pp. 248-250, 
Record). </p>
