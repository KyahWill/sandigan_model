11.0pt">against </span>Editha de Guzman, a 56-year-old widow, and her eventual
conviction.  From the sentence of life
imprisonment and a fine of P30,000.00, imposed by the Regional Trial Court of
Quezon City, Branch XIII,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a>  she now professes anew her innocence before
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People's version is that the "buy-bust operation"
was undertaken on November 15, 1988, at about 6:30 P.M. when Patrolmen Eduardo
Fajardo, Emmanuel Retiro, Nuguid and Asuncion, all members of the Quezon City
Police Force, Dagat-Dagatan Sub-Station, went to Serrano Street, Novaliches,
Quezon, to the residence of appellant Editha de Guzman.  They were accompanied by Elmer Diaz whom
they had arrested earlier in the afternoon for pushing marijuana.  Elmer had pointed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a</span>ppellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">as </span>his
source of illicit drugs (tsn, January 1, 1989, pp. 5-6; tsn, January 25, 1989,
p. 7; tsn, February 9, 1989, pp. 4-5).  Elmer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">had </span>told the team
that appellant was selling marijuana for P500.00.  They then prepared the amount, consisting of five (5) P100.00<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>bills, which they photocopied (tsn,
February 9, 1989, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pp. </span>7-9, 11;
Exhs. B - B-4).  No special marking was
made on the bills but the policemen instead listed down its serial numbers in a
small notebook <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(tsn, </span>February 9,
1989, p. 8; Exh. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to plan, Patrolman Fajardo acted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>the "poseur buyer," while Patrolmen Retiro,
Asuncion and Nuguid provided support (tsn, January 9, 1989, p. 7; tsn, February
9, 1989, p. 4).  Elmer first went inside
the house of appellant, leaving Patrolman Fajardo outside.  Once inside, Elmer informed appellant that
somebody wanted to buy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P500.00 </span>worth
of marijuana.  A little later, Elmer and
appellant went out to where Patrolman Fajardo was (tsn, January 25, 1989, pp.
6-8).  The latter then handed the bills
worth <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P500.00 to </span>appellant, who,
in turn, gave him a package containing marijuana (tsn, January 9, 1989, p.
7).  It was at this moment that the
back-up team led by Patrolman Retiro approached and assisted Patrolman Fajardo
in arresting appellant (ibid., p. 11; tsn, February 9, 1989, p. 8).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was taken to the headquarters where she was
investigated (tsn, January 9, 1989, pp. 9-13; tsn, February 9, 1989, p.
9).  The package handed by appellant
(Exh. E) was brought by Patrolman Retiro to the NBI for examination, the
results of which proved positive for marijuana (tsn, January 9, 1989, p. 12;
tsn, February 9, 1989, p. 10; tsn, April 13, 1989, pp. 3-7; Exh. C).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was accordingly charged in Court.  She defended herself by denying any buy-bust
operation (tsn, June 13, 1989, p. 15).  She further claimed that the marijuana was not hers but was left in her
care by Dolores Urbana and Elmer Diaz on November 15, 1988 at around 4:00
P.M.  It was the first time that
appellant met Elmer although she admitted having known Dolores before, as the
latter was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">an </span>ambulant vendor in
her place from whom she bought vegetables regularly.  The prohibited drug was contained in a "bayong," which
had ripe bananas on top.  Elmer and
Dolores promised to return for the "bayong" as soon as they had
finished collecting debts from customers.  All the while, appellant thought that its contents were all vegetables
(ibid., pp. 4-6).</p>

<p class="BODY">Continuing, appellant narrated that at about 6:00 P.M. of the
same date, Elmer returned without Dolores.  Instead, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>accompanied
by two men who introduced themselves <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span>Patrolmen Eduardo Fajardo and Emmanuel Retiro.  Elmer then took the "bayong" and removed its
contents.  Underneath was the marijuana
covered with newspaper, which he gave to the policemen (ibid., pp. 6-8).</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding her explanation, she was arrested and brought to
the police station.  There, she alleges
that she was physically maltreated and raped by Patrolman Fajardo.  Later, she was "sodomized" by
Patrolman Retiro causing her anus to bleed (ibid., pp. 8-14; Exhs. 1 &amp;
2).  Because of these abuses that she had
suffered at their hands, she pressed charges for rape against Patrolmen Fajardo
and Retiro with the National Police Commission (Appellant's Brief, pp. 3 &amp;
9).</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witness Amparo Serrano, appellant's neighbor, recalled
having seen a man and a woman entering appellant's house on November 15, 1988,
at about 4 P.M.  Later, at about 6 P.M.,
she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">saw </span>three (3) men entering
appellant's house.  Thirty (30) minutes
later, the three (3) men, together with appellant, left the latter's house
carrying a bag earlier brought by the man who had gone to appellant's house at
4 P.M. (tsn, August 29, 1989).  The
witness, however, did not positively identify the people who were the subject
of her testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">Convicted, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>heretofore
stated, appellant submits that the Court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>erred:</p>

<blockquote>"1. x x x in
finding that appellant met for the first time Dolores Urbana, the owner of the
'bayong' containing marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. x x x in
appreciating the testimonies of Patrolmen Eduardo Fajardo and Emmanuel Retiro
and ignoring the testimony of appellant and Amparo Serrano.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. x x x in
rendering a judgment finding appellant guilty of violation of Section 4,
Article II of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence before us, appellant's guilt is evident.  Her defense that Dolores Ubana and Elmer
Diaz were the actual owners of the marijuana <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is </span>pure concoction.  Unquestionably, marijuana was found in her possession.  She was caught completely unaware, never
suspecting even for a moment that Elmer Diaz, who used to be her ally in the
field, would turn against her and expose her to the police.  Because of her full trust in him, she had no
hesitation in believing what he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">had </span>told
her that there was someone interested in buying marijuana.  Unsuspectingly, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">she </span>fell right into the trap.  She sold the marijuana to a poseur buyer.  She accepted payment therefor in the form of five <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P100.00 </span>peso bills.  She had sold, delivered, and given away to
another <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>prohibited drug, in
contravention of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The error imputed to the Trial Court, which allegedly found that
appellant had met Dolores Ubana for the first time, lacks merit for it is plain
that it was Elmer Diaz whom the Court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>was
referring to.  At any rate, whether
appellant met either one for the first time or had been previously acquainted
with them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>really immaterial
in so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">far </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>appellant's guilt is
concerned.  She was caught <u>in</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">flagrante</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> <u>delicto</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Imputing bias and prejudice to prosecution witnesses, Patrolmen
Fajardo and Retiro, would not save the day for appellant. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">  </span>That
she had charged them administratively with maltreatment and rape remains <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>bare allegation.  And even assuming that the charge had, in
fact, been filed, that would not <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ipso</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>facto</u> </span>establish its
commission.  Besides, it is a matter
altogether alien from the charge at hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical certificate (Exh. 2) submitted by appellant does not
yield any finding of rape or "sodomy" perpetrated against her.  Rather, the certificate points out that
appellant's anus bled because of "severe anxiety and tension,"
presumably caused by her arrest and realization of impending incarceration.</p>

<p class="BODY">But whether or not one was ill motivated against the other,
hence, the filing of the charge and countercharge, the fact remains that the
Court <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> gave </span>credence to the testimonies of
the agents of the law for having been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">straightforward
and clear </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">against the posturings of the defense which
it found, and which we affirm, incredible and unworthy of belief.  Which brings us to the accepted principle in
this jurisdiction that the findings and conclusions of the Trial Court relative
to the credibility of witnesses are accorded the highest respect, absent
established exceptions which are non-existent herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Upon the evidence then,
the guilt of appellant has to be pronounced, and she must suffer the
consequences of her act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
