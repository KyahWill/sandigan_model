<p class="BODY">In view of the failure of private respondent to object to the
presentation of evidence showing that there were four (4) rental increases on
the subject premises although three <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">(3) </span>of
said increases are not alleged in the pleadings, judgment may be rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">validly </span>as regards the said increases
or issues which shall be considered as if they have been raised in the
pleadings (I Moran, p. 377, 1979 ed.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, section 5, Rule 10 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"When issues not raised by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">pleadings </span>are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,
they shall be treated in all respects, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as
</span>if they had been raised in the pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such amendment of the pleadings as may be
necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">raise </span>these <span class="SpellE">isues</span>
may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but
failure to so amend does not affect the result of the trial of these
issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent contends, however, that since petitioner
failed to present any resolution of its board of directors authorizing the
imposition of higher <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">rentals </span>over
the premises and their acceptance by private respondent, the award of damages
was properly limited by respondent court to P45<span class="GramE">,142.00</span>
monthly rental.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An examination of respondent's answer to the complaint made no reference
to the alleged board resolution which is now being insisted upon to escape the
payment of the increased rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having
failed to raise the board resolution as a defense before the trial court,
private respondent is deemed likewise have waived the same (Sec. 2, Rule
9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this is not all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the Regional Trial Court, private
respondent did not controvert the evidence submitted by petitioner in
determining the fair rental value of the premises including those imposed on
all other tenants of petitioner occupying the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Arcade (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 133).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only when the rental demanded is
clearly exorbitant would the courts interfere as a matter of equity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, indeed, the rental increases were
unconscionable, respondent should have at least presented evidence to
substantiate its claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is because
the burden of proof to show <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">that </span>the
rental demanded is unconscionable or exorbitant rests upon private respondent
as the lessee (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">v. CA, </span>63 SCRA 302 [1975]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent failed to discharge its
burden when it omitted to present any evidence at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">all </span>on what it considers is the fair rental value other than what
were submitted by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, all the other tenants of petitioner in the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Arcade did not question the reasonableness of the rental increases and paid the
same.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the imposition of one (1%) percent interest on unpaid
rentals<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">, respondent </span>court
committed no<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> error in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">eliminating the same not only because it was
not prayed for in the complaint but also because Art. 1956 (Civil Code) so
provides -- "(n)o interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated
in writing".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the one </span>(1%)
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">percent interest on delayed payment of
rentals may have been provided in the original written contract of lease, it
must be noted that said contract has already been terminated as </span>of <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the time petitioner filed its complaint
for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> in 1977, there was no longer any
written contract to speak of, much less a written stipulation on payment of
interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> assails
the decision of the Court of Appeals excluding the award of cost of electricity
consumed in the premises on the ground that the claim for reimbursement may be
filed in another action before the proper forum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> vs.
Villanueva (139 SCRA 431 [1985]), we have repeatedly held that the only damage
that can be recovered in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit is the
fair rental value or the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of
the real property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other damages must be
claimed in an ordinary action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the
decision of the Court of Appeals dated November 2, 1988 is REVERSED and SET
ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Regional
