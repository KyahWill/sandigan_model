the evening of <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1977</st1:date>,
and the members of the <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> family were inside their
house in the town of <st1:city><st1:place>San Antonio</st1:place></st1:city> in
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Outside it was windy and rainy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, several shots rang out from under
the house and Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> moaned in pain, evidently
hit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moments later, he was dead with
wounds in his neck, chest, arms and knee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sound of the shots and Gloria <span class="SpellE">Puri's</span>
shouts for help drew neighbors to the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The matter was immediately reported to the authorities and that same
night three policemen came to investigate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They found six empty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">carbine
shells under the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also went
in search of the two persons claimed to have been seen walking away from the
scene of the crime after its commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1977</st1:date>,
an information for murder was filed against <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>
Velasco, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span> and
Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reinvestigation on their motion, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>
was dropped from the charge for insufficiency of evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After arraignment and trial, the two remaining
accused were found guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> plus
payment of indemnity to the victim's heirs in the sum of P20,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, both Velasco and <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>
claim that they were invalidly convicted on insufficient circumstantial
evidence in disregard of their constitutional right to the presumption of
innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal witnesses for the prosecution were Clarita <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>, who both
pointed to the two accused-appellants as their brother's killers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their separate testimonies, they said that
when they heard the shots, they went to the window and saw the two accused
walking away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Velasco had a
shotgun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clarita was at the time carrying
an oil lamp and Domingo a flashlight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They heard Sergio moaning and it was then they realized he had been
shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was too late to help him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pat. <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>, also testifying for the prosecution, said
that he had investigated the killing that </span>same night, together with
three other policemen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They found <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">six </span>used carbine shells under the <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clarita
reported to him that she saw the two accused walking away from under their
house minutes after she heard the shots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He told her to go to the municipal building and make a formal statement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He was corroborated by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, who was also in the investigating team.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This witness said they found footprints under
the house that led to the house of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another investigator, Pat. Manuel Vasquez, had a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">s</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lightly
different story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While confirming their
discovery of the spent carbine shells, he testified that when Clarita was
interviewed by <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,
she could not tell who her brother's assailants were.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> Velasco, testifying for
himself, denied killing Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> and said he was
residing in <span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span>, another town in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, at the time of the killing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As for <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>, who
also took the stand, he said he was in his house with his family the whole
night of <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1977</st1:date>, and
could not have committed the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, he was already 69 years old and had poor eyesight, which was
the reason he had stopped working in his farm the year before.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Dr. Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Maninang</span> confirmed <span class="SpellE">Comel's</span>
defective vision, saying the accused was suffering from <span class="SpellE">presbyopia</span>
and cataract.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another witness was Capt. Valentino <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>
of the PC Crime Laboratory, who testified that he paraffin-tested <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span> and Armando Mercado
on <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1977</st1:date>, and found
them negative for powder burns.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He did not say he had also tested the two accused-appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was disclosed at the trial that the <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>
family used to be employed in <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel's</span> farm as their harvesters but he had dismissed them
several years earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> Velasco replaced them and became a close <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">friend of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> was charged with having killed <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Comel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito's</span> brother,
but the case was dismissed in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office
after Sergio made a cash settlement with the family of the victim.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances were regarded by the trial judge as the basis
for the motive in the killing of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span> said
the motive was revenge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This revenge <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>carried
out by the two accused, with Velasco as the actual gunman in conspiracy with
his close friend and employer, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>, who had accompanied him that night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that they were both not at home when
the policemen went looking for them that same night indicated that they were
hiding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Velasco was even seen crossing
the river on the way to <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span>, presumably to escape.</p>

<p class="BODY">It bears noting at this juncture that the house where the victim
was shot, like many houses in the province, was a one-story structure raised on
pillars and with an empty space underneath.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The elevation of the floor was about two-and-one half meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any person in this area could look up and see
the occupants inside the house through its bamboo flooring.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the room where Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>
was standing and mending a fish net (or sitting, according to Domingo) was lit
with three oil lamps, it was easy for the killer or killers to identify and
shoot him from below.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court does find it strange that the killing should have been
done under these circumstances but the fact is that it did happen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> died from the shots fired from under him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only question is whether the killers were
<span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> Velasco and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Comel</span>, as the trial judge held.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the offense was committed on <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1977</st1:date>, the record shows that it took one
month before the accused-appellants were formally indicted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, although three persons were
originally charged, one of them was dismissed after a reinvestigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also noted that two days after the
killing three persons were paraffin-tested by the police but not either of the
two accused-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was a
curious omission in light <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the
report made by Clarita <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span> on the very night of the killing that she saw
Velasco and <span class="SpellE">Comel</span> leaving the scene of the crime
immediately after she heard the shots.</p>

<p class="BODY">The explanation given by the prosecution is that the <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> family was afraid to press charges, especially so
since the former station commander was partial to the accused and was
protecting them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only when he was
replaced that the complainants dared to come forward and accuse Velasco and <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are inconsistencies in the separate narrations made by
Clarita and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> but only on minor points
that do not detract from their essential credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>
was standing or sitting shortly before he was shot or whether Clarita stayed by
the window for thirty seconds or three minutes is not really that important as
long as the testimony of the witness is on the whole credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is important is that, although Clarita
and Domingo may have differed on some of the details, their common declaration
was that they saw the two accused-appellants walking away from under the house
minutes after the shots were fired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense theorizes that Clarita and Domingo could not have
failed to see that Sergio had been shot and that their first reaction would
have been to go to him instead of to the window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sergio was in fact talking with Domingo,
according to Clarita, when the shots were fired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the room where they were all in at
the time was after all not big and all the occupants were within sight of each
other.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can also only conjecture like the defense but the other
plausible view is that Clarita's and Domingo's first impulse was to go to the
window to see where the shots had come from, not yet realizing that one of them
had been shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Clarita who said
Sergio and Domingo were conversing when Sergio was shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo never said that; what he said was
that he was behind his brother shortly before he heard the shots.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One may well wonder why a 69-year old man would go out on that
windy and rainy night to accompany the killer and, stranger still, why they
would simply <u>walk</u> away after the shooting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the fact is that <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>
Velasco and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>
were actually seen together that night under the house of the slain Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> and they were not running but simply walking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It would have been more believable for
Clarita and Domingo, if they wanted to be more convincing, to say that the two
men they saw were running, for this was the natural thing to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that these witnesses did not do so
is perhaps an index itself of their truthfulness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> that they
found footprints in the mud leading from the <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>
house to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel's</span>
house must be taken with a grain of salt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is doubtful how the footprints could have been preserved on that
rainy night, let alone the fact that there were allegedly many such footprints
and none was identified as belonging to either of the accused-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the muddy soil might have
been the reason why <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
accused-appellants were not running but carefully treading their way so as not
to slip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also noteworthy that when the investigators reached <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel's</span> house and asked
for him they were told he was not there.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span> himself did not deny this particular statement of
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> although he insisted that he was at
home all night on <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he was really there and had nothing to
hide, <span class="SpellE">Comel</span> would have come out and talked to the
investigators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Velasco was also nowhere
to be found that night after the killing and did not deny that he was seen
crossing the river on the way to <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has carefully analyzed the evidence against the
accused-appellants and finds that, although only circumstantial, it is
sufficient to convict them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The various
circumstances pointing to them as the killers have successfully overcome the
constitutional presumption of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their
innocence and established their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">They were seen immediately after Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>
was shot and killed from under his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Velasco was carrying a shotgun, later identified at the trial as a
carbine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That same night <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">six </span>spent carbine shells were found at
the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span> was not in his
house on the night of the killing when the policemen went to see him, and
Velasco for his part was also missing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And there was also motive:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the
alleged killing by Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Comel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito's</span> brother,
and <span class="SpellE">Juanito's</span> dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">Puris</span>
as harvesters in his farm, as a result of which they and his family ceased to
be on speaking terms.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given these circumstances, it was inevitable that the accusing
finger should point to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Comel</span>
and his friend and employee, Velasco.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And more so since there does not seem to be any other plausible
explanation for the killing of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span>, who was
an ordinary fisherman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Definitely, the
killers did not come to rob, for they left immediately after the slaying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only target was Sergio <span class="SpellE">Puri</span> although there were other occupants in the house who
were equally exposed and defenseless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
has not been shown either that there were other persons who had a grudge
against the victim and could themselves have committed the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court was correct in finding that there was a
conspiracy between Velasco and <span class="SpellE">Comel</span> as they
evidently acted in concert in pursuit of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>common design.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were properly
found equally guilty of the crime of murder, qualified by treachery, but
without the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and night-time,
which were not established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
reason why these factual findings should be reversed or modified, absent a
showing that they were reached without basis or with grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED except for
the civil indemnity, which is increased to P30,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the accused-appellants.</p>
