This is a petition for prohibition, <em>certiorari</em>, and <em>mandamus </em>with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction filed by petitioner Buayan Cattle Co., Inc. praying of this Court that:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "x x judgment be rendered commanding and enjoining respondent 
judge to desist and re­frain from proceeding with Civil Case No. 631 of 
the lower court; nullifying or setting aside the order for the issuance 
of writ of injunction, Annex B hereof, the writ of preliminary 
injunction, Annex C hereof, and the order denying the motion to dismiss,
 Annex N hereof, in Civil Case No. 631 for lack of jurisdiction, and (c)

    </p>
    <p> "Petitioner further prays for such other relief as may be just and equitable in the premises" (pp. 23-24, rec.). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The undisputed facts of the case are as follows:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Petitioner, Buayan Cattle Co., Inc., an all-Filipino domestic 
corporation, is the holder of Pasture Lease Agreement No. 8, as 
successor-in-interest to Universal Realty Corporation.  Said agreement, 
first issued on April 18, 1952 under Commonwealth Act No. 452 (p. 46, 
rec.), covers 1,000 hectares of pasture land in Southern Cotabato, "the 
identification and technical descriptions of which have been laid out 
and estimated and approved on November 20, 1958 by the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources.  Since the acquisition of the 
aforesaid property by the predecessor-in-interest of the defendant 
corporation, the same has been surrounded with fences xx x" (p. 47, 
rec.). </p>
    <p>
    On September 11, 1964, Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510 was 
allegedly issued in favor of private respondent, Adan de las Marias.  It
 covered 930 hectares of land adjacent to that of petitioner's.  The 
agreement was to expire on January 30, 1975.
    </p>
    <p>
    Upon issuance of Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510, and in compliance
 with the terms thereof, Adan de las Marias immediately caused a 
relocation survey of the said pasture area by a forest guard of the 
District Forester of Southern Cotabato to determine the extent of his 
land and thereafter to fence the same.  The survey showed that the 
boundaries of his land extended 580 hectares into the pasture land of 
the petitioner.  Thereupon, he removed the petitioner's fence and 
started to set up his own boundary fence 580 hectares into the 
petitioner's pasture area.
    </p>
    <p> On March 31, 1965, petitioner reported to the District Forester 
at General Santos, Cotabato, "that yesterday afternoon the ranch in 
charge of Adan de las Marias started putting up concrete monuments along
 conflicting common boundary of Adan de las Marias and Buayan Cattle 
Company" and asked for advice "if the putting up of these fences was 
legally sanctioned by your office x x x" (p. 48, rec.).  The District 
Forester sent a forest guard to investigate the report.  On May 8, 1965,
 the corporation again reported to the District Forester the resumption 
by private respondent of the construc­tion activities in the disputed 
area.  On the same date, petitioner corporation, through its Manila 
office, filed a letter-complaint with the Director of Forestry against 
the private respondent, alleging the non-existence of the area leased 
under the latter's pasture lease agreement and suggesting remedial 
measures to protect the interests of the corporation.  The Director of 
Forestry wired the Forestry at General Santos, ordering the latter "to 
stop alleged fencing by Adan de las Marias inside the area leased to 
Universal Realty Corpora­tion now being transferred to Buayan Cattle 
Ranch until boundary conflict resolved." Forester Ben­jamin Meimban was 
sent by the Director's office to settle the boundary conflict.  On May 
13, 1965, the acting District Forester in General Santos, Emiliano 
Sonico, ordered the private respondent "to stop putting your fences 
until the relocation of the correct boundary will be laid by Forester 
Benjamin Meimban" (p. 48, rec.). </p>
    <p> On May 21, 1965, the corporation, through its Manila office, 
complained to the Director of Forestry of the defiance of private 
respondent herein of his orders, as a result of which, the Director 
wired the Provincial Commander of Cotabato "for assistance to stop Adan 
de las Marias from fencing inside the pasture area leased to petitioner 
corporation at General Santos, Cotabato"(p. 50, rec.). </p>
    <p>
    Investigation on the boundary conflict began on May 24, 1965.
    </p>
    <p> On May 27, 1965, the relocation of the bounda­ries of the 
conflicting leases was commenced.  Since then, the conflict between 
petitioner corporation herein and private respondent has been pending 
reso­lution by the Director of Forestry. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
On September 7, 1965, due to reports of further disturbances, the 
Director of Forestry issued a tele­graphic order to the District 
Forester, Southern Cota­bato, as follows:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "UNIVERSAL REALTY REPORT BY RADIO­GRAM PERTINENT PORTION QUOTE 
JULIUS QUIMPO REPORTED TO ME THIS MORNING THAT ADAN DE LAS MARIAS WANTED
 US TO DRIVE AWAY OUR HORSE AND COWS FROM THE AREA UNDER CONFLICT 
UNQUOTE PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO CONFLICTED AREA AND SEE TO IT THAT ADAN 
DE LAS MARIAS REFRAIN DISTURBANCE IN CONFLICTED AREA PERIOD CHIEF PC 
CRIME REQUEST TO ENFORCE PEACE AND ORDER PERIOD COORDINATE WITH PC"
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Thereafter, on September 17, 1965, the Direc­tor of Forestry sent a 
telegram to private respondent herein, warning him that his 
non-compliance with the lawful orders of the Director may cause the 
cancella­tion of his pasture lease.
</p><p>
On September 25, 1965, private respondent filed a complaint for 
injunction with preliminary injunction docketed as Civil Case No. 631, 
with the Court of First Instance of Cotabato, 16th Judicial District in 
General Santos, Cotabato, seeking to enjoin petitioner herein, Buayan 
Cattle Co., Inc., the District Forester of South­ern Cotabato, the 
Director of Forestry, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
 and the Area Commander, Fourth Military Command of the Armed Forces of 
the Philippines, from restricting him in the exercise of his lease 
rights.  On the same day, the preliminary injunction prayed for was 
granted.  On September 29, the writ thereon was issued, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is therefore ordered that until further orders of this Court, 
you, the said Universal Realty Corporation and/or Buayan Cattle Company,
 Inc., Hon. Secre­tary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Director of
 Forestry, District Forester, Southern Cota­bato, and the AFP IVth 
Military Area Commander, and all your servants, attorneys, and agents, 
and other acting in aid of you, are hereby ordered to desist and refrain
 from driving inside and/or allowing its cows, horses, and other large 
cattles within the conflicted area of 580 hectares which is within the 
area covered by plaintiff's Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510, situated 
at Sitio Balnabo, barrios of Sigil and Balnabo, General Santos, 
Cotabato, and to pasture and graze therein either temporarily, 
intermittently, or periodically, or for a short and limited and/or 
sporadic periods, <em>to re­frain and desist from issuing an order, 
either originally or by virtue of its appellate powers or jurisdiction 
the Director of Forestry, which in any manner whatsoever, will 
contravene or violate Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510 entered into by 
and be­tween him for and in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines as
 Lessor and plaintiff as Lessee on September 11, 1964 at Quezon City; 
from enforcing the telegraphic order, dated September 7, 1965 and 
September 17, 1965, which directed plaintiff to refrain from causing 
disturbance inside the conflicted area, and also to desist and refrain 
from issuing any subsequent orders which will, in any manner, violate 
and infringe the terms and conditions of Pasture Lease Agreement No. 
2510; or issue any order which will cause the cancellation with­out due 
process of law of the said Pasture Lease Agreement; and to desist and 
refrain from exercising police powers in the premises and from taking 
and following orders from the Director of Forestry relative to the 
conflicted area in violation of plaintiff's right thereon</em>, or to 
aid, help, abet and give support to the act of defendant Univer­sal 
Realty Corporation and/or Buayan Cattle Company, Inc., and all those 
acting in its behalf, in allowing, driving inside, cows, horses, 
carabaos, and other large cattles, within the conflicted area of 580 
hec­tares which is supposedly or allegedly within the area covered by 
the Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510 of the plaintiff and from further 
acts of disposses­sion (p. 8, rec.; Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On October 4, 1965, petitioner filed a motion to dissolve said writ.  On
 October 6, 1965, said petitioner also filed a memorandum in support of 
his aforesaid motion.  On October 15, 1965, private respondent answered 
said memorandum.
</p><p>
Subsequently, on October 20, 1965, the effectivity of Pasture Lease 
Agreement No. 2510 was suspended by the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources due to prima facie showing that forgery was committed 
in the survey inspection report on special use application dated March 
4, 1964, a document required for the issuance of the pasture lease 
agreement (p. 138, rec.).
</p><p>
Before the motion for dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction 
could be resolved, peti­tioner herein, the District Forester and the 
Direc­tor of Forestry, and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources filed their answers to the complaint on October 25, 1965, 
November 22, 1965 and December 13, 1965, respectively.
</p><p>
In its answer, petitioner questioned the relocation survey conducted by 
the forest guard for having been conducted by one not competent to do 
so.  It also contested the validity of the said survey for not having 
been made in accordance with the rules of the Bureau (p. 64, rec.).
</p><p>
In the same answer, petitioner filed a counter­claim against herein 
private respondent "by reason of the evident bad faith and malice of the
 plaintiff (now private respondent) in instituting this instant action" 
(pp. 69-70, rec).  Petitioner further alleged the following expenses and
 damages P10,000.00 paid for the services of a counsel to protect its 
legal rights over the property in question; and P5,000.00 as damages 
suffered in the concept of actual and incidental expenses "which shall 
continue to be increased for all the time that this case is pend­ing 
adjudication by the courts" (p. 70, rec.).  Finally, petitioner alluded 
to "an award of corrective, and exemplary damages in the sum of Fifty 
Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos, and for the adjudication of moral, and 
nominal damages, as well as for legal costs" (p. 70, rec.).  In the same
 vein, petitioner sought "such other relief as may be just and equitable
 in the premises" (p. 72, rec.).
</p><p>
On February 17, 1966, about 124 days from the date the motion to 
dissolve was deemed submitted for resolution, the Judge's order dated 
January 28, 1966 was entered by the clerk of court, denying said motion 
to dissolve the writ of prelimi­nary injunction (p. 11, rec).
</p><p>
On March 4, 1966, petitioner, through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss Civil Case No. 631 for absence of jurisdiction.
</p><p>
On April 1, 1966, opposition was filed against the motion.  On June 8, 
1966, the said motion was denied "for not being well taken" (p. 102, 
rec).  On August 1, 1966, herein petitioner filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the order of denial of the motion to dismiss.
</p><p>
On August 12, 1966, said motion was submitted for resolution.  An ex 
parte urgent motion to secure immediate resolution of said motion was 
filed on October 4, 1966.  To date, no resolution has been made on the 
motion.
</p><p>
Thus, this petition for prohibition, <em>certiorari</em> and mandamus.
</p><p>
WE noted the expiration of Pasture Lease Agree­ment No. 2510 on January 
30, 1975.  On October 10, 1980, this Court, by resolution required the 
parties to state "whether in view of the aforesaid supervening event and
 the lapse of time, the instant petition has become moot and academic."
</p><p>
On December 17, 1980, private respondent submitted his comments leaving 
the resolution of this petition to the discretion of this Court.  On 
February 20, 1981, herein petitioner filed its answer stating that the 
case should not be rendered moot and academic by the expiration of 
respondent's pasture lease agreement.
</p><p>
At the outset, We resolve the incidental issue consequent of the 
expiration of Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510 on January 30, 1975.
</p><p>
This Court had, in fact dismissed proceedings where the issues raised 
therein have been rendered moot and academic by supervening 
circumstances (E. Razon, Inc. vs. Moya, L-31690, Feb. 24, 1981, 103 SCRA
 41; Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration vs. Reyes, L-27665, May 
31, 1977, 77 SCRA 205; Garcia vs. Court of Appeals, L-35234, May 26, 
1977, 77 SCRA 148).  WE ruled in these cases that to further rule on the
 petition would serve no useful purpose.
</p><p>
But the case at bar, however, presents both facts and issues We cannot 
relegate to oblivion.  The petitioner claims damages against the private
 respondent (pp. 23-24, 69, 70, 72, rec.) as the contested area of 580 
hectares is significant to the party unjustly or unlawfully deprived 
thereof.  The maximum area allowable to any single, qualified entity 
under the Pasture Land Act (Sec. 3, CA 452) is 2,000 hectares; 
petitioner is leasing 1,000 hectares of pasture land, while private 
respondent claims a lease right to 930 hectares of pasture land.
</p><p>
Further, We review the facts and see an unlawful deprivation dangerously
 cloaked in a feigned contractual right.  Worse, We recognize a 
perversion of a writ of preliminary injunction effectively re­straining,
 not the wrongdoer, but the person who is in the vigilant protection of 
his rights.  The circumstances not only warrant, but impel Us to 
consider the merits of this petition and afford a practicable relief to 
the party entitled thereto.
</p><p>
The kernel issue is the propriety or impropriety of the injunction 
complaint filed by the private re­spondent with the Court of First 
Instance of Southern Cotabato and of the issuance of the writ of 
preliminary injunction therein by the same court.
</p><p>
WE find for petitioner.
</p><p>
Two requisites are necessary if an injunction is to issue, namely, the 
existence of the right to be protected, and that the facts against which
 the injunction is to be directed are violative of said right (Araneta, 
et al. vs. Gatmaitan, et al., L-8895 &amp; L-9191, April 30, 1957, 101 
Phil. 328).  In particular, for a writ of preliminary injunction to 
issue, the existence of the right and the viola­tion must appear in the 
allegation of the complaint.  A preliminary injunction is proper only 
when the plaintiff appears to be entitled to the relief demanded in his 
complaint (Manila Adjusters and Surveyor Co. vs. Bocar, L-44126, Feb. 
29, 1977, 75 SCRA 421).  And We recall that the complaint for injunctive
 relief must be construed strictly against the pleader (43 C.J.S. 867; 
The Revised Rules of Court, Vicente J. Francisco, Vol. IV-A 1971, p. 
206).
</p><p>
Upon the facts of the complaint filed (pp. 25-37, rec.), We rule that 
the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the lower court is improper
 and without basis.  It is clear from the complaint that the first and 
older possessor of the disputed area is the petitioner herein.  
Moreover, his possession is by virtue of an undisputedly valid lease 
agreement with the government.  This affords the petitioner preference 
against any other claim of right over said land.  Conversely, any 
subsequent claimant can raise no more than a doubtful claim over the 
property in question, which dubious claim militates against the issuance
 in his favor of a writ of preliminary injunction.  Preliminary 
injunction will not issue to protect a right not in <em>esse </em>(Angela Estate, Inc. vs. CFI of Negros Occidental, L-27084, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 500).
</p><p>
Furthermore, in actions involving realty, preliminary injunction will 
lie only after the plaintiff has fully established his title or right 
thereto by a proper action brought for the purpose (Liongson vs. 
Martinez, No. 11553, Oct. 8, 1917, 36 Phil. 148).  To authorize 
temporary injunction, the complainant must make out at least a prima 
facie showing of a right to the final relief (43 C.J.S. 433; Francisco, <em>supra</em>, p. 175).
</p><p>
WE note that the writ of preliminary injunc­tion issued by the lower 
court left private respondent unperturbed in the occupation of the 
dis­puted area.  This, in effect, sanctioned his usurpation.  Clearly, 
from the complaint itself, the private respondent was the usurper.  It 
was he who <em>unilaterally </em>removed the fence of the petitioner and
 set his own boundary fence 580 hectares into the petitioner's pasture 
land, thus violating herein petitioner's superior right thereto.  The 
protective mantle of preliminary injunc­tion should not have been 
afforded to the usurpation by private respondent.  Injunctions are not 
available to take property out of the possession or control of one party
 and place it into that of another whose title has not clearly been 
established (Emilia vs. Bado, L-23685, April 25, 1968, 23 SCRA 183; Pio 
vs. Marcos, L-27849, April 30, 1974, 56 SCRA 726).  The office of the 
writ of injunction is to restrain the wrongdoer (Calo vs. Roldan, L-252,
 March 30, 1946, 76 Phil. 445, 451-452), not to protect him.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "There is no power the exercise of which is more delicate which 
requires greater caution, deliberation and sound discretion, or (which 
is) more <em>dangerous in a doubtful </em>case than the issuing of an 
injunction; it is the strong arm of equity that never ought to be 
extended unless to cases of great injury, where courts of law cannot 
afford an ade­quate or commensurate remedy in damages.  <em>The right must be clear</em>,
 the injury impending or threatened, so as to be averted only by the 
protecting preventive process of injunction" (28 Am. Jur. 201; 
Francisco, <em>supra</em>, p. 179).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reviewing the records of this petition, We note the following undisputed
 facts that militate against private respondent's alleged lease right 
over the disputed area:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  Petitioner, Buayan Cattle Company, Inc., was a <em>prior lessee </em>(since 1952) in the <em>actual, peace­ful and continued possession</em> (at lease since 1958) of the disputed area until the private respondent herein,<em> Adan de las Marias</em>, on the strength of a pasture lease granted only in 1964, <em>unilaterally </em>removed
 the former's fences and immediately established his own boundary fence 
580 hectares into the petitioner's pasture land (pp. 28, 29, 47, rec.). </p>
  <p> 2. Meanwhile, Annex A to private respondent's answer to this 
petition (p. 138, rec.; order of the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources dated October 20, 1965 suspending the effectivity of 
Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510) and Annex B to the memorandum for the 
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction filed by herein petitioner 
on January 25, 1967 (affidavit of District Forester Emmanuel Elayda on 
the forgery of his signature appearing in the Inspection Report on 
Special Use Application dated March 4, 1964; pp. 284-286, rec.) 
unequivocally raise doubts as to the veracity and validity of Pasture 
Lease Agreement No. 2510; and </p>
  <p> 3.  Finally, the relocation survey caused by the private 
respondent to determine the exact location of the pasture land allegedly
 awarded to him under Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510 is questioned as 
irregular for having been conducted by a forest guard, a person not 
competent to do so.  The validity of the said survey itself is also 
contested as not having been made in accordance with the rules of the 
Bureau of Forestry. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The strong arm of equity, this transcendent or extraordinary remedy of 
injunction should not be lightly indulged in but should be used 
sparingly and only in a clear and plain case (The Value of Preliminary 
Injunction, 95 SCRA 716, 718-719, citing 28 Am. Jur. 198).
</p><p>
Even assuming, arguendo, that Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510 is valid 
as to the documents and the relocation survey aforestated, still We 
maintain and rule that the complaint for injunction filed by private 
respondent herein and the writ of preliminary injunction issued therein 
are, at least, premature.
</p><p>
Private respondent admits the presence of an actual possessor under a 
lease right in the disputed area prior to his own entry and occupation 
thereof.  Assuming that private respondent's lease right is equally 
valid as that of the present possessor, herein petitioner, the former's 
course of action should not have been to destroy the petitioner's fence 
and enter the disputed area and set up his own fence therein.  Private 
respondent should seek the aid of a competent court and not take the law
 into his own hands.  Usurpation is not sanctioned as a method of 
acquiring possession.  The Civil Code provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Article 536.  In no case may possession be acquired through force
 or intimidation as long as there is a possessor who objects thereto.  
He who believes that he has an action or a right to deprive another of 
the holding of a thing, must invoke the aid of the competent court, if 
the holder should refuse to deliver the thing."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Moreover, private respondent failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
</p><p>
WE find the following provisions of law pertinent:
</p><p>
(1) Under the Revised Administrative Code --
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 79(c).  Power and supervision.  -- The Depart­ment Head

interest. </p>

      </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Evidently, the foregoing cited provisions out­line the administrative 
procedure which the private respondent herein should have pursued prior 
to invoking the aid of the competent court.  Consonant with the doctrine
 of exhaustion of administrative remedies, where a remedy is available 
within the administrative machinery, this should be resorted to before 
recourse can be made to the courts, not only to give the administrative 
agency opportunity to decide the matter by itself correctly, but also to
 prevent unnecessary and premature resort to courts (Cruz vs. Del 
Rosario, L-17740, Dec. 26, 1963, 9 SCRA 755; Miguel vs. Reyes, L-4851, 
July 31, 1953, 93 Phil. 542; Coloso vs. Board of Accountancy, L-5760, 
April 20, 1953, 92 Phil. 938; Arnedo vs. Aldanese, 63 Phil. 768).
</p><p>
Such <em>failure here results in the absence of a cause of action</em> (Pineda vs. CFI of Davao, et al., L-12602, April 25, 1961, 1 SCRA 1020) <em>making judicial resort premature </em>(Villanueva vs. Ortiz, L-11412, May 23, 1958, 103 Phil. 875).
</p><p>
The conflict of rights to possession which arose from the subsequent 
issuance of Pasture Lease Agreement No. 2510 is of such nature as to 
demand the "exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the 
special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative 
tribunal to deter­mine technical and intricate matters of fact . ." (42 
Am Jur 698; Administrative Law, Law on Public Officers and Election Law,
 Neptali A. Gonzales, 2nd Ed., 1966, p. 112).
</p><p>
Further, We note that Civil Case No. 631 is a complaint for injunction. 
 The remedy of injun­tion does not issue except upon the condition, 
common to all special remedies, that no other ordinary, speedy and 
adequate remedy exists for avoiding or repairing the damage done, or 
which may be done, by an act in violation of the plaintiff's rights 
(Palafox vs. Madamba, No. 4735, Aug. 7, 1911, 19 Phil. 444; Devesa vs. 
Arbes, No. 4891, March 23, 1909, 13 Phil. 273).  The administrative 
procedure afforded by the laws above-cited is ordinary, speedy and 
adequate.  The administrative proceedings are pending with the District 
Forester of Southern Cotabato.  Hence, complainant in Civil Case No. 631
 is not entitled to an injunction as there is already an action pending 
in which he may obtain relief (Francisco, <em>supra</em>, p. 222).
</p><p>
OUR cardinal statement, therefore, is that private respondent does not 
have a cause of action for injunction.  His right to the disputed area 
is doubtful.  And even assuming that he has a right to the said pasture 
land, still, not having exhausted the administrative remedies available 
to him, the action for injunction in Civil Case No. 631 is, at least, 
premature for absence of a cause of action.
</p><p>
The act of private respondent in unilaterally entering the petitioner's 
land is unlawful and un­just.  The petitioner's act of repelling the 
private respondent's entry into the former's land is sanctioned by law, 
thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Article 429.  The owner or lawful possessor of a thing has the 
right to exclude any person from the enjoyment and disposal thereof.  
For this purpose, he may use such force as may be reasonably necessary 
to repel or prevent an actual or threatened unlawful physical invasion 
or usurpation of his property. </p>

  </p>
  <p> "Article 539.  Every possessor has a right to be respected in his 
possession; and should he be disturbed therein he shall be protected in 
or restored to said possession by the means established by the laws and 
the Rules of Court" (Civil Code of the Philippines). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The letter-complaint filed by herein petitioner is consonant with the 
procedure sanctioned by the Revised Administrative Code and Forestry 
Administrative Order No. 6-2, series of 1941.  The orders issued by the 
Director of Forestry, including those dated September 7 and 17, 1965 are
 well within the powers of said office.
</p><p>
WE hold therefore, that respondent Judge com­mitted a <em>grave abuse of discretion</em>
 when he issued the writ of preliminary injunction dated September 29, 
1965 in Civil Case No. 631.  That injunction had the effect of 
restraining, not the wrongdoer, but the person in the vigilant 
protection of his rights and those who come to the latter's help.  In 
Chief, PC vs. Judge, CFI of Caloocan City (Nos. L-22308 &amp; L-22343-4,
 March 31, 1966, 16 SCRA 607), We ruled that the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction to restrain any interference with the illegal 
operation of a cockpit was in grave abuse of discretion.  The rule 
equally applies here.
</p><p>
Finally, We consider the proposition of herein private respondent that 
while this Court can compel the lower court to act on the complaint in 
Civil Case No. 631, IT cannot compel the latter, by mandamus, to dismiss
 said case as prayed for by herein petitioner (p. 132, rec.).  True, <em>mandamus </em>is
 not available to compel a court to do a discre­tionary act (Caltex 
Filipino Managers and Supervisors Association vs. Court of Industrial 
Relations, L-28472, April 30, 1968, 23 SCRA 492).  <em>Mandamus </em>is not available to compel a judge to decide a case or motion in a particular way (Pio vs. Marcos, <em>supra</em>;
 Santiago Labor Union vs. Tabigne, L-21028-29, May 29, 1966, 17 SCRA 
286; Dy Cay vs. Crossfield, 38 Phil. 521).  But, where the complaint 
filed in the lower court is decidedly without a cause of action, as in 
this case, then <em>mandamus </em>will lie to compel the dismissal of 
said complaint.  In this latter case, the dismissal is not 
discretionary, but ministerial, and therefore subject to mandamus.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, THE PETITION IS HEREBY GRANTED, THE ORDER FOR THE ISSUANCE OF
 A WRIT OF INJUNCTION AND THE ORDER DENYING THE MOTION TO DISMISS IN 
CIVIL CASE NO. 631 ARE HEREBY SET ASIDE AS NULL AND VOID.
</p><p>
THE CASE IS REMANDED TO THE LOWER COURT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF HEARING 
THE HEREIN PETITIONER BUYAN CATTLE CO., INC. ON THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES 
AGAINST PRIVATE RESPONDENT ADAN DE LAS MARIAS.  COSTS AGAINST SAID 
PRIVATE RESPONDENT.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro</em> and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino</em>, J., in the result.
