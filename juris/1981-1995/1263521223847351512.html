This is an appeal from a judgment of the defunct Court of First Instance
 of Misamis Occidental in Criminal Case No. 19 sentencing FERNANDO JUELA
 to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> for the crime of robbery with homicide.
<p>
The information against Juela reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 13th day of February, 1970, at about 11:00 
o'clock p.m. more or less, at barrio Cebulin, municipality of Plaridel, 
province of Misamis Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction
 of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring and confederating
 together with one whose whereabouts is unknown and still at-large, with
 the use of force and by means of violence upon things, did then and 
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously and with intent of gain and 
against the consent of the owners thereof, namely:  Ruperta Vda. de 
Carnalna and her late husband Juan Carnalna take and carry away the 
following personal properties to wit:  (1) clothes, (2) jewelries and 
(3) cash money, all totaling the value of P250.00 Philippine Currency, 
to the damage and prejudice of the said owners in the said total sum; 
that on the occasion of the aid robbery and for the purpose of enabling 
them to take, steal and carry away the articles above mentioned, the 
herein accused, used force and violence by breaking open the main door 
of the house of the owners, by the use of an ax; that said accused in 
pursuance of the conspiracy, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously  and 
with evident premeditation and taking advantage of their superior 
strength and with intent to kill, treacherously attack and shot Juan 
Carnalna which directly and necessarily caused his instantaneous death."
 (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 18.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The trial court, as aforesaid, sentenced the accused to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify the heirs of Juan Carnalna the sum of P12,000.00 and to pay the costs.  (Id. p. 188.)
</p><p>
The defense of the appellant was alibi and in this appeal he questions 
the credibility of the prosecution witnesses while he claims the quality
 for himself as shown by the following assignment of errors, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I.   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDIT TO THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS MARCIANO QUICOY. </p>
  <p>
    II.   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING DUE WEIGHT AND CONSIDERATION TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE.SURVIVING SPOUSE RUPERTA CARNALNA.
  </p>
  <p> III.   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING DUE WEIGHT AND 
IMPORTANCE TO THE POLICE REPORTS STATING THAT THE DECEASED JUAN CARNALNA
 WAS ROBBED BY UNKNOWN PERSONS." (Brief, pp. 1-2.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The People's version of the facts is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "There is no question that at about 11 o'clock at night, on 
February 13, 1970, Juan Carnalna and his wife were robbed of their 
valuables and that Juan Carnalna was shot in the abdomen and on the 
thigh from which he died two days later.  The crime was committed in 
Barrio Sibulin, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.  The robbers broke into 
the house of the couple by destroying the door.  As Juan Carnalna rose, 
he was shot by one of the intruders.  In panic, Juan ran to the kitchen 
door and jumped out.  (Transcript 35-37, Oct. 6, 1970).  Juan was taken 
to the Immaculate Concepcion Hospital in Plaridel, Misamis Occidental 
shortly after he was shot and wounded.  On February 15, 1970, at 9 
o'clock in the morning, he died.  (Transcript 12, Sept. 2, 1970) </p>
  <p> The dispute turns on the identity of the culprits.  The widow 
Ruperta Carnalna pointed to the accused as the one who shot her husband 
and afterward, at the point of the gun and a knife, took from her P250 
in cash, a man's jacket belonging to her husband, worth P35.00, a 
necklace valued at P60.00, two gold rings worth P20.00 each and a pair 
of earrings worth P20. 00 (Transcript 34, 40-43, Oct. 6, 1970) The widow
 testi­fied that she was able to identify the accused as one of the two 
robbers because they had a gas lamp lighted all night long and because 
she had known the accused, the latter having been their neighbor in 
Sibulin for five years before the accused moved to Barrio Luzaran, Lopez
 Jaena in the same province.  (Transcript 55-57, 61, Oct. 6, 1970) 
According to her the accused wore a yellow shirt and dark pants and had a
 grass hat on with its brim tilted down.  She testified that aside from 
the illumination provided by the gas lamp, she was able to recognize the
 accused because the latter and his com­panion had flashlights with 
them. </p>
  <p>
    At the hospital, Juan Carnalna told his wife and Marciano Quicoy and
 Teofilo Hugtas that he had been shot by the accused Fernando Juela.
  </p>
  <p> On the other hand, the accused claims that on the night in 
question, he was at home in Luzaran, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental  
(Transcript 100, April 14, 1971).  In support he presented Ignacio 
Antipuesto who testified that he knew the accused stayed home on the 
night in question because he (Ignacio Antipuesto) slept in the house of 
the accused in preparation for the 'hunglos' (cooperative farm work) the
 following day.  (Transcript 22-23, Dec. 1, 1970)" (Brief, pp. 3-5.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And now to the assignment of errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1. Marciano Quicoy testified that he was a good friend of Juan 
Carnalna; that on February 14, 1970, he was informed by Juan's daughter 
that her father had been shot and robbed the night before; that he 
Visited Juan at the hospital; that he conversed with Juan who told him 
that he was shot by Fernando Juela.  (TSN, Mancao, pp. 23-28.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The appellant contends that the testimony of Quicoy was presented 
only to prove that he had a conversation with Juan Carnalna but not as 
to the truth of Juan's statement.  This contention is well-taken.  In 
fact, the People's brief concedes this point thus:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Indeed, we may grant the contention of the accused that since 
the testimony of prosecution witnesses Marciano Quicoy and Teofilo 
Hugtas (to the effect that the deceased had told them that he had been 
shot by the accused) was offered merely to prove the tenor of the 
conversation rather than the truth thereof and that therefore the 
testimony of those witnesses could not be used for any other purpose." 
(Brief, pp.  6-7.) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    2. Ruperta Carnalna, the widow of Juan, was the only witness who 
gave direct evidence on the robbery and slaying.  She testified in part 
as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p> A     Hat made of ticog." (TSN, Mancao, pp. 34-44.) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The appellant claims that Ruperta could not have identified him as
 one of the robbers because "The facts to which this witness testified 
took place in rather rapid succession and were attended by hurry and 
excitement, and moreover, the house was dimly lighted." This claim is 
not well-taken for as the above-quoted testimony shows:  (a) She had 
known Fernando Juela, the appellant, for about five years because they 
were neighbors [on cross-examination she added that "his physical and 
his movement is familiar to me"]; (b) at the time of the incident the 
house was lighted with a Standard lamp [on cross-examination she said, 
"We cannot sleep without a light"); and (c) she was able to describe 
what the appellant wore, namely:  a yellow shirt, black pants and a hat 
made of ticog. </p>
  <p>
  3. The appellant makes much of two reports.
  </p>
  <p> Exhibit 4 is a spot report sent by the PC detachment in Plaridel 
to the PC Headquarters in Oroquieta City which reads: "460PC 102-116.  
Spot report robbery in band with frustrated homicide.  Unsolve.  On or 
about 132400 February 13, 1970, at barrio Sibulin, Plaridel, this 
Province, for unknown persons armed with ax, pistol, caliber 25 and 22 
caliber revolver, robbed the house of one Juan Carnalna, 48 years old, 
married and a resident of said barrio.  Robbers get away cash amount 
P200.00; P150.00 worth jewelries and assorted cloths and before leaving,
 he shot victim three times hitting two in the stomach and left thigh. 
Victim was brought to the Mendoza Hospital at Plaridel for treatment 
while case presently investigated by joint PC-police.  Progress report 
follows." (TSN, Suan, pp. 119-120.) </p>
  <p> Exhibit 5 is an entry in the police blotter of Plaridel, Misamis 
Occidental, dated February 14, 1970, which reads: "At about 12:05 
midnight at barrio Sibulin, this municipality, Juan Carnalna was robbed 
by unknown robbers.  The said victim was shot by the said robbers three 
times hitting his stomach and thigh.  The robbers were able to bring 
with them valuables including cash money in the amount of P350.00.  The 
said victim is now confined at the Immaculate Concepcion Hospital in 
this municipality." (Id., p. 121.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should be noted that the reports were made immediately after the 
incident and the only eye-witness thereto was Ruperta, the widow.  The 
trial court correctly observed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "xxxThe widow, Ruperta, denied she was ever investigated by said 
police officers [Sgt. Prado and Patrolman Angeles], because all the time
 she was beside her seriously wounded husband in the Mendoza clinic up 
to his death on February 15, 1970, in the morning.  That this must be so
 is more than possible, for she could not, in conscience, leave her 
husband who was hovering between life and death.  Moreover, the robbery 
was already an accomplished fact.  Even granting that she was 
investigated, cases are replete wherein the identities of perpetrators 
of crimes are not immediately disclosed by the victims for fear of 
reprisal.  In his case she later on publicly (in the town hall of 
Plaridel) pointed out accused Fernando Juela as one of the robbers, and 
executed a sworn statement, Exhibit "4" ["1"] and Exhibit "C" the 
searching questions and answers by municipal judge Pacito Mutia, 
relative to the shooting of her husband and the robbery as well as the 
identity of Fernando Juela as the assailant and one of the robbers.  Her
 direct testimony jibes with said affidavit and statements before said 
Judge.  Though her affidavit was executed a week after the robbery the 
value given to is not in the least diminished." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 185-186.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The appellant's defense of alibi - that throughout the evening of 
February 13, 1970, he was in his house at Luzuran, Lopez Jaena, Misamis 
Occidental - a defense which can easily be fabricated, must be rejected 
because he was positively identified as one of the perpetrators of the 
crime.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed with the 
sole modification that the appellant shall pay the amount of P30,000.00 
as indemnity to the heirs of Juan Carnalna.  Costs against the 
appellant.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
