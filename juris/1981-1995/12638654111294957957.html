				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A <u>cause of action</u> is the fact or combination of facts
which affords a party a right to judicial interference in his behalf.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
An <u>action</u> means an ordinary suit in a court of justice, by which one
party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the
prosecution or redress of a wrong.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>cause of action</u> must always consist of two
elements:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the plaintiff's primary
right and the defendant's corresponding primary duty, whatever may be the
subject to which they relate - person, character, property or contract; and (2)
the <span class="SpellE">delict</span> or wrongful act or omission of the
defendant, by which the primary right and duty have been violated.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The cause of action is determined not by the prayer of the complaint but by the
facts alleged.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The term <u>right of action</u> is the right to commence and

In the law on pleadings, <u>right of action</u> is distinguished from <u>cause
of action</u> in that the former is a remedial right belonging to some persons,
while the latter is a formal statement of the operative facts that give rise to
such remedial right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former is a
matter of right and depends on the substantive law, while the latter is a
matter of statement and is governed by the law of procedure.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The right of action springs from the cause of action, but does
not accrue until all the facts which constitute the cause of action have
occurred.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
When there is an invasion of primary rights, then and not until then does the
adjective or remedial law become operative, and under it arise rights of acti<span style="">o</span>n.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no right of action until there has been a wrong - a
violation of a legal right - and it is then given by the adjective law.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The herein petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of a decision

the Regional Trial Court of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed antecedents are that on <st1:date month="9" day="15" year="1988">September 15, 1988</st1:date>, petitioner filed a
complaint for damages and other equitable <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> in
the trial court, the relevant allegations of which are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff and defendant have been friends and in the course of this
relationship, they have exchanged mutual favors and accommodations, including
discounting of checks for cash.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More than seven (7) years ago,
several checks were issued by plaintiff to defendant in exchange for cash which
probably amounted to P280,900.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due
time, these checks were either fully paid, settled<span style="">, extinguished or condoned by agreement of the parties, and for which
reason, plaintiff did not anymore redeem the checks precisely because they have
been close and mutual friends.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>5.a.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lately, however, plaintiff received from defendant's lawyer a demand
letter dated 1988 supposedly detailing out therein the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>

<blockquote>Copy of said letter is
attached hereto as Annex A and made an integral part hereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claim of P568,541.00 is not due and owing from the plaintiff to the defendant
because, as already stated, the amounts of the checks issued to defendant some
more than (7) years ago, were either fully paid, settled, extinguished or
treated as condoned by agreement of the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the said letter, Annex A hereof, defendant threatened to
"institute the proper action and hold (plaintiff) liable for the
consequence," in the following manner:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: 0in;">… unfortunately, you had
not heeded his (defendant's) request and so we hereby inform you that this
shall <u>definitely</u> be our last letter<span style="">
to </span>you on this matter and we are giving you a <u>final</u> period of ten
(10) days from receipt hereof to remit full payment of said sum of P568,541.00,
otherwise, without need of further advice to you, we shall institute the proper
action and hold you liable for the consequence.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Defendant knows fully well that the sum of P568,541.00 is not wholly or
partly due or owing to him from plaintiff particularly the huge, fantastic, and
unwarranted claim for alleged legal interests in the sum of P235,956.00 which
roughly accounts for 84% of the alleged principal amount being collected by
defendant from plaintiff under his ill-<span class="SpellE">tenored</span> Annex
A hereof, and the unwarranted claim for attorney's collection fees of
P51,685.00.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff is very reluctant to file the instant complaint against his
defendant friend but was gravely agitated to do so because of a clearly
perceived and palpable injury to him as unequivocally expressed in defendant's
letter, Annex A hereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the circumstances given, defendant has kept possession of the alleged
checks amounting to P280,900.00 at the expense of plaintiff and since the
obligation <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> has either been fully or wholly
paid, settled, extinguished, or condoned by agreement of the parties, defendant
holds them without just or legal ground and is bound to return them to
plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In writing the letter, Annex A hereof and demanding therein an
obligation from plaintiff which is not due and owing from the latter, defendant
failed to act with justice, observe honesty and good faith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>11.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To prosecute the instant action, plaintiff has incurred actual expenses
in the sum of at least P15,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the circumstances herein-above given, defendant acted in a wanton,
reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, exemplary damages in the sum of P200,000.00 should be imposed
against the defendant for the public good, in addition to other damages claimed
herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>13.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nominal damages should be adjudicated against the defendant in order
that the right of plaintiff which has been invaded by the defendant, may be
vindicated or recognized, and not for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff
for any loss suffered by the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>14.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To prosecute the case herein, plaintiff has retained the services of
counsel at the agreed attorney's fees of P75,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that, after due hearing,
judgment be rendered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ordering defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of P15,000.00 as actual or
compensatory damages;</blockquote>

</span>Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff the exemplary damages in the sum
of P200,000.00;</blockquote>

in Annex A of the complaint and adjudicating nominal damages in favor of
plaintiff and against the defendant;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="10" day="8" year="1988">October 8, 1988</st1:date>,
private respondent filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of cause of
action and prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition
thereto was filed by petitioner to which a reply was made by private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a rejoinder was
submitted by petitioner, on <st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1988">November
 24, 1988</st1:date> the trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to
state a cause of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration thereof filed by petitioner, which
was opposed by private respondent, and to which a reply was filed by
petitioner, was denied by the trial court on <st1:date month="3" day="17" year="1989">March 17, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
and other relief in the Court of Appeals against said orders of the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, on <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1990">January 30, 1990</st1:date>, the Court of
Appeals rendered its decision dismissing the appeal with costs against
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the herein petition whereby petitioner alleges that the
trial court committed a grave abuse of discretion in issuing the questioned
orders dated November 24, 1988 and March 17, 1989, and that the Court of
Appeals did likewise in dismissing the appeal of petitioner thereby
disregarding a question of substance not in accord with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the complaint shows that it is therein alleged that
more than seven (7) years ago, several checks were issued by petitioner to
private respondent in exchange for cash amounting to P280,900.00; that in due
time, said checks were "either fully paid, settled, extinguished or
condoned by agreement of the parties" so petitioner did not anymore redeem
the checks because of their friendship; that on August 30, 1988, private
respondent's lawyer sent a letter of demand to petitioner to pay said principal
amount plus interest and attorney's fees with a total amount due of
P568,541.00, which claim is not due and owing having been settled between the
parties; that in sa<span style="">id </span>letter
threat of court action was made causing injury to petitioner; that private
respondent illegally withheld the petitioner's checks which should be returned
to petitioner; that for private respondent's act of demanding payment for an
obligation not due and for the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> failure to
act with justice, observe honesty and good faith, petitioner prays for relief
by way of actual, exemplary and nominal damages, and also prays that the
private respondent be ordered to return to petitioner the checks mentioned in
the complaint, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the findings of the lower court and the appellate court
that the complaint states no cause of action, this Court finds and so holds
that it states a sufficient cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered that when a party files a motion to dismiss
the complaint for lack of cause of action he is deemed to hypothetically admit
the allegations thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the allegation of the complaint in this case it appears
that, (1) petitioner has a primary right, because of having paid his obligation
to private respondent, to have the checks he issued to cover the amount returned
to him or otherwise cancelled by private respondent; and (2) the primary right
of petitioner was violated when private respondent demanded payment of a
settled obligation relying on the very checks of petitioner he had not
returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, on account of
such demand for payment for an obligation duly settled, the petitioner thereby,
suffered damages<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and should be afforded such relief as prayed for in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the observation made by the appellate court, the
cause of action had not prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cause of action accrued only on <st1:date month="8" day="20" year="1988">August
 20, 1988</st1:date> when in a demand letter for payment private respondent
thereby committed a wrongful act against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was filed promptly on <st1:date month="9" day="15" year="1988">September 15, 1988</st1:date>, well within the
four (4) year prescriptive period of an action of this nature.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED and the questioned
decision of the Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="1">January

Court of Manila dated <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="11">November 24,
