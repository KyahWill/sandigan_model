				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a verified complaint dated April 6, 1978, filed by Atty.
Francisco I. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> against Judge <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
B. Pablo of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
Branch XIII at <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, for "doing and
consenting to the doing of falsehood, falsification of public document,
dishonesty, deceit, misrepresentation of facts, abuse of authority, oppression
and/or serious <span class="GramE">misconduct</span> or inefficiency unbecoming
(of) a member of the bench and bar" (Complaint, p. 2, rec.). The details
of the alleged irregularities are amplified in six specifications which may be
summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about August 25,
1977, the respondent, taking advantage of his official position as CFI Judge in
<span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, and
exercising undue influence over his personnel and gravely abusing his
authority, caused the preparation, the signing and insertion into the record of
Criminal Case No. 266-A a false document entitled "Minutes" (Annex A,
p. 15, rec.), knowing that such minutes never existed because the true minutes
of the May 17, 1974 hearing is found on page 253 of the records of said <span style="">case </span>(Annex
B, p. 16, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said false minutes
contain a false statement of fact to the effect that it was Jaime V. <span class="SpellE">Ariston</span> who acted as stenographer when in truth and in fact
it was Carmelita de Castro who was the stenographer during the said hearing, as
shown by the affidavit (Annex D, p. 18, rec.) of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Balan</span>, who acted as Inter­preter for the same
hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of the
appealed decision from the Court of Appeals in CA-<span class="SpellE">GR</span>
No. 16898-CR [Criminal Case 266-A], the respondent issued a commitment order
(Annex E<span style="">, </span>p. 19, rec.) of the
body of the accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span> addressed to
the Provincial Warden of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> in which it was
made to appear that his imprisonment will commence to run from the "8th
day of February, 1977" when in truth and in fact it should commence on
January 10, 1977, as shown <span style="">by </span>another
commitment order (Annex F, p. 20, rec.) also signed by the respondent, which is
the one attached to the records of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
deliberately altered the deci­sion as affirmed and quoted in <span style="">the </span>Court of Appeal's decision by
changing the word "with" to "without" in its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion, such that the phrase which reads
"with subsidiary imprisonment" in the affirmed decision now reads
"without subsidiary imprisonment" quoted in the order of commitment
(Annexes E and F, pp. 19-20, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
certified <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the decision of the Court of
Appeals is found on pp. 22-30 of the records of this administrative case.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent affirmed
under oath that the decision of the Court of Appeals in said criminal case
contains a typographical error in misstating the word "with" for
"without" when in truth and in fact the decision affirmed by the
Court of Appeals says "with subsidiary imprisonment", and the "out"
is an insertion between the words "with" and "subsidiary."</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the reply of Judge
Pablo as complainant in Adm. Case No. 1837 (Pablo vs. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>),
he denied under oath his signature on the commitment paper marked as Annex E
hereof, stating that he signed only the other commitment paper [Annex F, with
the date of commencement written <span style="">as </span>10th of January, 1977, p. 19, rec.].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Warden of <span class="SpellE">Panga­sinan</span>,
however attests (Annex G, p. 21, rec.) that the original of Annex E was duly
signed by the re­spondent and that there is no other commitment paper
pertaining to Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span> except that one [<span style="">same </span>Annex
E] which is on file in his office.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the requirements of this Court in the Order
dated <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1978</st1:date> (p. <span style="">35, </span>rec.), the respondent filed his
comment <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1978</st1:date> [<span style="">pp. </span>39-51, rec.], denying all the charges against him and
praying for the dismissal of the case for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="7"><span style="">July </span>19,
 1978</st1:date>, the Court referred this case to Associate Justice Milagros
German of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report and recommendation <span style="">(p. </span>52, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, before any investi­gation
could be conducted, the parties filed a Joint Petition to Dismiss dated <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1978</st1:date> (pp. 53-54, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was denied in the resolution of <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1978</st1:date> which directed the
investigating Justice to conduct the investigation as previously ordered (p.
57, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice German set the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1978</st1:date> (p. 65, rec.), which was reset
to <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1978</st1:date> (p. 64,
rec.) upon motion of the complainant (p. 59, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the latter date, only the complainant
appeared to ask for another resetting <span style="">(p.
</span>62, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was granted,
and a last resetting to October 24, 1978 was made with the warning to the
respondent that should he again fail to appear it will be understood that he is
waiving his right to present evidence on his behalf (p. 63, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">When on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="10">October 24,
 1978</st1:date>, neither of the parties appeared despite notice, the
investigating Justice took it as a reiteration of their desire to have the case
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, Justice German
proceeded to evaluate the evidence already in the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She submitted her report on the investigation
and recom­mendation on November 6, 1978 with a finding that "there appears
to be a strong <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> <span style="">case </span>against respondent Judge Pablo for the
offense of falsification of public and official documents on three (3) counts,
as defined and penalized under <span style="">Article </span>171 of the Revised Penal Code"
(p. 73, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, while she was
constrained to recommend the dismissal of this case in view of the
complainant's failure to substantiate his complaint, she also recommended that
the case be forwarded to the Department of Justice for the State Prosecutor to
prosecute the respondent for having evidently falsified the following:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision <span style="">as affirmed </span>by the Court of Appeals,
by changing the word "with" to "without" subsi­diary
imprisonment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes of the hearing on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1974</st1:date> in Criminal Case No.
266-A; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commitment paper in the same criminal case
by making it appear that the time of imprison­ment of accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span> will commence to run on <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1977</st1:date> instead of <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1977</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The charges against the respondent are fully substantiated by
official records, even if the com­plainant did not appear at a formal hearing
which was reset several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent was given all the chances to present evidence in his behalf, which
chances <span style="">he </span>chose to ignore (p.
67, rec.) and therefore waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
waiver shows that the re­spondent did not have any evidence to support his
avowed innocence and his denial of the charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such denial cannot stand against the positive docu­mentary evidence
attached to the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the records shows that this case is an offshoot of
Criminal Case No. 266-A filed in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of
respondent Judge against Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span> for
homicide thru reckless imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
trial, respondent Judge found the accused guilty as <span class="GramE">charged,</span>
and rendered judgment the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding that the prosecution had sufficiently
established the guilt of the accused of the crime of reckless imprudence
resulting in homicide charged in the information beyond reasonable doubt, the
accused is hereby sentenced to suffer impri­sonment, according to Art. 365,
par. 2, of the Revised Penal Code, and the indeterminate sen­tence law, of one
(1) year and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> in its minimum period to three (3)
years, <span style="">six </span>(6) months and
twenty-one (21) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correc­cional</u></span> in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused is also ordered to reim­burse the
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> <span class="SpellE">Ca­barlo</span>
the medical and funeral expenses in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
and to indemnify the heirs of the victim <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabarlo</span> the amount of P12,000.00 with subsidiary im­prisonment
as provided in Art. <span class="GramE">39, <span class="SpellE">R.P.C</span>., and
with cost.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, in view of the absence of the respond­ent Judge who was
on vacation leave for the period from <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="5">May
 16 to 31, 1974</st1:date>, it was Judge Gregorio A. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>,
the vacation Judge, who promulgated the decision on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="5">May <span style="">17, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> (p. 17, </span>rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was elevated to the Court of Appeals
on appeal, which affirmed the judgment of conviction in its decision of <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1976</st1:date> (p. 30, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, several administrative cases emanated from said criminal
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first one was filed by the
accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span> on <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1974</st1:date> against respondent Judge Pablo (A.M.
No. 733-CFI) for incom­petence, or ignorance of the law or deliberate viola­tion
of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was dismissed by this
Court for <span style="">lack </span>of merit on <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1977</st1:date> <span style="">(pp. </span>33-34, A.M. 733-CFI rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second case [A.M. No. 1837] was filed by respondent Judge Pablo
against Atty. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>, the defense counsel
in the said criminal case, in com­pliance with the directive of this Court and
for the said lawyer's alleged refusal to surrender his copy of the decision for
correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case appears to have
been abandoned by the complaining Judge (respondent herein) when he jointly
filed a petition to <span style="">dismiss </span>with
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> in respect to that case [Adm. M. No.
1837] and the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case,
the findings herein will have a direct bearing on the merits or lack of merit
of the second case.</p>

<p class="BODY">This <span style="">is </span>now the
third related case that <span style="">is </span>traceable
to Criminal Case No. 266-A. As earlier shown, the Court denied the joint
petition to dismiss, and Justice German was directed to proceed with her in­vestigation,
following a time-honored principle that the complainant's loss of interest in
prosecuting the case does not warrant the dismissal of an administrative case (<span class="SpellE">Beduya</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Alpuerto</span>, 96 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 673, 675 [1980]; <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuagaoen</span>, 89 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 101, 109
[1979]; Vasquez vs. <span class="SpellE">Malvar</span>, 85 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
10, 26 [1978]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Anguluan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Taguba</span> (93 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 180, 185), <span class="GramE">We</span> held:</p>

<blockquote>"Although the complainants have asked for the withdrawal of
this complaint, the Court cannot overlook the anomalous acts of the respondent
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actuations of the respondent
judge seriously affected the pub­lic interest inasmuch as they involve the administration
of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that
the motion to withdraw the complaint filed by the complain­ants will not
justify the dis­missal of this administrative case against the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the Supreme Court in Vasquez vs.
<span class="SpellE">Malvar</span>, 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Furthermore,
to condition ad­ministrative actions upon the will of every complainant, who
may, for one reason or another, condone a detestable act, is to strip this
court of its super­visory power to discipline erring members of the
Judiciary."'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it appears that the respondent cannot
satisfactorily explain the existence <span style="">and/or
authenticity of certain documents relative to Criminal Case No. 266-A, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lengthy explanations
of the respondent about this may be summarized as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that Annex A is not false, having been signed
by the Vacation Judge and the Deputy Clerk of Court; </span>that he only relied
on the certifications of these two officials because he was on leave; that the
minutes marked as Annex B was not signed by these court officials; that the two
minutes (Annexes A and B) do not necessarily contradict each other, in fact
they complement each other and give a true picture of what happened on May 17,
1974; that there is an existing original of <span style="">said </span>Annex A, as in fact he was able to get a copy thereof as
early as June 14, 1974 when he attached it as annex "1" to his
comment in Adm. Case No. 733-CFI; and that although Annex A has no page number,
it is still part of the records even though it was not attached to the records
of Criminal Case No. 266-A when the same was forwarded <span style="">to the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From this explanation it
is obvious that </span>Annex A is neither authentic nor part of the records of
Criminal Case No. 266-A, as the same was not assigned a folio or page number
nor attached to the records elevated to the Court of Appeals. More­over, since
he never denied the genuineness of the Minutes marked as Annex B and found on
page 253 of the records of the same criminal case, there could be no other
conclusion than that the certification/ minutes as he calls Annex A was a mere
accommodation on the part of vacation Judge Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
and the deputy clerk of court <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> to enable him to attach it to his comments for his
defense in A.M. No. 733-CFI.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, a perusal of
the original records of Criminal Case No. 266-A reveals that the original of
Annex A is not found therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the original of Annex B is not only found properly paged and sewn
on page 253 of the same records, but also appears to be on the same official
form as all other minutes of hearings in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of
respondent Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Dispositive</span></u></span><u><span style=""> portion</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the decision where
the phrase "<u>with</u> subsidiary imprisonment" has been changed to </span><span style="">"<u>without</u> </span><span style="">subsidiary imprisonment" as quoted in
the commitment paper of accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span>
(Annexes E, F and L).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent explains that the word "with" in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of said decision was a typographical
error and was then and there corrected to "without"; that the
correction was made even before the records were forwarded to the Court of
Appeals; and that the reason why the brief of the Solicitor General as well as
the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-<span class="SpellE">GR</span> No.
16898-CR quoted the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion without the
correction ("with subsidiary imprisonment"), is because the
Appellant's Brief used the uncorrected copy of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>
who refused to surrender the same for correction, such that both the Solicitor
General and the Court of Appeals were misled by it.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a very flimsy excuse, considering that both the Court of
Appeals and the Office of the Soli­citor General rely on the original records
of the case and not on the brief filed by a private lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1976</st1:date>, of the Court of <span style="">Appeals
</span>(pp. 270-276, rec. of CA-<span class="SpellE">GR</span> No. 16898-R) in
the same case quoted the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
appealed decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding that the prosecution had sufficiently es­tablished
the guilt of the accused of the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in
homicide charged in the information beyond reasonable doubt, the accused is
hereby sen­tenced to suffer imprisonment, according to Art. 365, par. no. 2 of
the Revised Penal Code, and the indeterminate sentence law, of one (1) year and

</span>in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Incidentally, the subject
criminal case was brought before this Court on a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The commencement of imprisonment
of accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span>, as likewise found in
the commit­ment paper (Annexes E and L), to make it appear to be February 8,
1977, instead of January 10, 1977.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent at first
denied having signed the original of Annex E (p. 19, rec.) where it is stated
that "the time of imprisonment will commence to run from the 8th of
February, 1977," when he made his reply as complainant in the second case
(A.M. No. 1837).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such denial is quoted
on page 11 of his comment in the instant case (p. 49, rec.), wherein it is
stated that he never signed the commitment paper represented by Annex
"9" of the second case (Annex E herein, p. 19, rec.), and that the
only commitment he signed was the original of Annex "10" (Annex F
herein, p. 20, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> has, however attached to his complaint a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy (Annex L, p. 34, rec.) of the original of Annex
E, together with a certification (Annex G, p. 21, rec.) from the Provincial
Warden of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> that it was the only commitment
paper ever received and on file in his office relative to accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
face of these documents, the respondent now has the following explanation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The reason why the respond­ent denied having signed Annex '9'
to answer in the second case, is because the same was only a mere <span style="">duplicate; and the same or a copy thereof was
not attached in the </span>record of Criminal Case No. 266-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only Annex '10' to complaint in the second
case was in the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
records show that the respondent had already issued the commitment marked Annex
'10' to the complaint in the second case and so, the respondent presumed that
he could not have signed Annex '9' which is in conflict with Annex '10'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant Atty. Francisco I. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>
has now attached the signed commitment (Annex 'L' of the <span style="">instant </span>case) which states that the
imprison­ment of <span class="SpellE">Bantolino</span> commenced to run from
February 8, 1977 and the other commitment which states that the imprisonment
commenced to run from January 10, 1977 also signed by the herein respondent and
marked <span style="">as </span>Annex 'F' of the
instant complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(For clarity, Annex '9' in the second case is identical to
Annex 'E' in the instant case, both are unsigned duplicates of Annex 'L' in the
instant case; and Annex '10' in the second case and Annex 'F' in the instant
case are identical.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is submitted that this re­spondent signed both commitment
papers (Annexes '9' and '10' in the second case or Annexes 'F' and 'L' in the
instant case) because both bore the genuine initials of the Deputy Clerk of Court
<span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>, which
gave rise to the error."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, these statements are vain attempts to wash away his
guilt, which appear indubitable in the light of the following circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent admittedly signed both
commitment papers which bear conflicting dates of the commencement of
imprisonment of the accused;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the original of Annex E (or Annex '9') is
attached to the records of the case (pp. 288-290, CA-<span class="SpellE">GR</span>
No. L-168-98-CR), while that of Annex "F" [or "10"] is not;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the original of Annex "F" [or
"10"] was sent to the Provincial Warden of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">All the
above show that the respondent has committed deliberate acts of falsehood
amounting to dishonesty and grave misconduct, and violated the time-honored as
well as an express constitutional principle that public office is a public
trust.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>His actuation is a disgrace to the Judiciary,
