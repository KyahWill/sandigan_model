				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Does a court have jurisdiction to entertain a complaint for rape not
subscribed or initiated by the victim who was already of legal age at the time
the crime was committed? This is the main issue presented to this Court by
appellant who was convicted of the crime of rape by the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch XV in Criminal Case No. AR-288.</p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered from the records of this case, the essential facts
are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In April, 1973, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> Tan, a
beautiful lass at the age of 23, went to stay with her aunt <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Alcoy</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> for a vacation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="4">April
 28, 1973</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> told her aunt that
she had to go to the comfort room which was located approximately 20 meters
away from the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> failed to return after 20 minutes, her aunt
began to worry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unable to find her
anywhere near the house, <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span> went to a nearby
store to ask a certain Jaime <span class="SpellE">Carulasan</span> to help her
look for her niece.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carrying a torch
light, Jaime and <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span> proceeded towards the town <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the w</span>ay, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">they </span>met three men who informed them that <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
was in the house of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>certain <span class="SpellE">Gildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Egon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Imediately</span>
thereafter, they went to the said house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arriving therein, <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span> went up
and met <span class="SpellE">Nicandro</span> <span class="SpellE">Anore</span>, the
co-accused of appellant in the lower court, who said, "I have nothing to
do with that." Upon hearing this statement, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Cal</span>ixta</span> and Jaime barged into a
room and saw the seemingly unconscious <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
lying on the floor with her dress raised up to her waist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was not wearing panties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also saw appellant <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
the son of the then incumbent mayor of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Alcoy</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
near <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was fixing his pants to cover his still exposed private organ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing the two, appellant put off the
light and ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Calixta</span>,
on the other hand, went to assist the trembling girl and with the help of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>, brought her home.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span> filed a report of
the incident in the PC Headquarters of <span class="SpellE">Sibonga</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1973</st1:date>, a
physical examination of <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> was conducted at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">PC </span>Crime Laboratory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the medico-legal were contained in a medical

<p class="BODY">Later, a complaint for rape was filed by the father of <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> against appellant <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Nicandro</span> <span class="SpellE">Anore</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 13, 1980, after due trial, the lower court rendered a
decision finding appellant <span class="SpellE">Nicandro</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
rape and imposed on him the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
and required him to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P40,000.00
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, however, acquitted <span class="SpellE">Nicandro</span> <span class="SpellE">Anore</span> for want of
sufficient evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal by <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the main issue, appellant argues that jurisdiction was
never conferred upon the trial court since the complaint was not signed by the
victim herself who was already of age, but by her father <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
Tan.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court, on the other hand, ruled that the father of the victim had the
perfect right to file the complaint in view of the incapacity of the latter who
was not in complete possession of her mental and physical faculties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 4, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court is the applicable provision
of the Rules in this regard, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“ SEC. 4<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Who must
prosecute criminal actions</u>:.-</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> </blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The offense of<span style="mso-tab-count:
1"> </span>seduction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall not be
prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her parents,
grandparents, or guardian, nor in any case, if the offender has been expressly
pardoned by the above-named persons, as the case may be.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> "<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the above provision of law, the right to institute a
criminal action for the offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts of
lasciviousness is reposed exclusively and successively in the persons
enumerated in the provision, in the order in which they are mentioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This means that no one has the authority to
proceed if there is some other person previously mentioned therein with legal
capacity to appear and institute the action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Therefore, a father cannot file a complaint for any of the above-mentioned
crimes committed against his daughter if the latter has the legal capacity to
appear and institute the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful scrutiny of the voluminous records of this case,
We hold that the complaint filed by the father of <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
is valid and sufficient and is not in violation of the jurisdictional
requirement of the law since the rape victim was incapacitated to file it
herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the purpose of the law
in placing the offended party in the first rank is to give her the preferential
right in the filing of the complaint, this does not apply where she is
otherwise physically or legally incapacitated to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the lower court that "the victim was not in
complete possession of her mental and physical faculties and was incapacitated
by reason of insanity" is well-supported.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Witnesses declared under oath that after the incident, the victim would
not talk, refused to eat and just spent her time as a timid and immobile
person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was corroborated by Dr.
Ortega, who, after an examination of the victim, concluded that she was not
capable of testifying in any court proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court judge personally examined the girl in court and saw for
himself the pitiable state she was in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She could not even do such simple acts like standing up and sitting down
so much so that somebody else had to assist her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Questions propounded to her were answered
with blank stares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the lower
court made the pronouncement that she is insane <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and </span>that she cannot testify in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot help but agree with the above finding after taking a
look at the photog<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">r</span>aphs of <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> which were offered as exhibits in the lower
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One cannot deny that the picture
taken of her after the incident is that of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>skinny, untidy, and frightened girl so different from that
taken of her previous thereto where she appears to be very healthy and
strikingly beautiful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is
unreasonable to expect her to file the necessary complaint with the proper
authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of the foregoing,
We hold that the father of a rape victim has the perfect right to initiate the
prosecut<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ion</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>a rape case in behalf of his
daughter, even if she is of legal age, if she is mentally incapacitated to do
so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, however, insists that he cannot be convicted of the
crime of rape on the basis of the circumstantial evidence presented by the
prosecution which allegedly does not clearly establish his guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also maintains that the lower court should
not have considered the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> and
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Carulasan</span> because they are incredible and are
contradictory to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
also claims that the injuries of <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> were
caused by her aunt who <span class="SpellE">continously</span> whipped her with
coconut leaves after finding her half naked in the house of <span class="SpellE">Egon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further explains that when <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>, without
her panties, in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">kitchen </span>of
the house, the latter was only urinating.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lastly, appellant insists that he could not have raped <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> as he considered her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>relative.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree with appellant that there is no sufficient basis
for the judgment of conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
the victim was not able to testify in court due to her mental illness, the
facts and circumstances surrounding in this case clearly prove the commission
by the appellant of the crime of rape against her person.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, rape is committed if
the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman and such act is accomplished under
the following circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By using force or
intimidation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the woman is
deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the woman is
under twelve years of age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned
in the two next preceding paragraphs shall be present.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the medico-legal officer who examined <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> the day after the incident showed that the
victim had sexual intercourse very recently and that force was applied on her
as evidenced by the presence of numerous abrasions, lacerations and other
injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to the identity of the
offender, the aunt of the victim and witness Jaime <span class="SpellE">Carulasan</span>
were positive that it was appellant whom they saw inside the room with the
girl, his private organ still exposed although he belatedly tried to avoid
being identified by putting off the light and scampering away.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> and
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Carulasan</span>, We reiterate the oft-repeated rule
that inconsistencies and contradictions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on
</span>minor matters do not affect the credibility of such testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, it is the testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span>the appellant which appears unconvincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is hardly believable that <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Calixta</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
would mercilessly whip <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her </span>already
physically weak and very frightened niece on the sensitive parts of her body
causing all those injuries found on her by the medico-legal officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the explanation of appellant
that the victim was just urinating in the kitchen when <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Carulasan</span> arrived is incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is not probable that a
young, unmarried lady like <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> would venture
to go alone to a very dark room in a stranger's house without bringing any lamp
or any other form of illumination with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, it does not seem to be a practice of women to remove their
panties in order to urinate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pulling
them down is sufficient <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>the
purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also reject the contention of appellant that since he
considers <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>his relative, his claim of innocence is fortified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, appellant got strongly attracted
to <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> because, as described by his own witness,
she very was very beautiful that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">night.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>If there<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

likelihood there could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>cases
of men raping their distant relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the family of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> does not consider appellant as their relative.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also take into consideration the fact that appellant failed to
show any motive on the part of the parents of <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
to fabricate charge against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
was also no reason given by him for <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span>
testifying against him when his own mother declared that <span class="SpellE">Calixta</span>
had good relations with them before the incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

This observation holds true as well for the other prosecution witness Jaime <span class="SpellE">Carulasan</span> whom appellant considered as a close friend.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
