Antonio Liao, Ramon Isberto, Ester Ceniza-Isberto, and Evelyn Sarmiento, and a

Military Tribunals, on or about the year 1968 and for sometime prior and
subsequent there­to, and continuously up to the present, in Capas, Tar­lac, and
elsewhere in the Philippines, knowingly, wil­fully and by overt acts, did
organize, join and remain as officers and/or ranking members of the Communist
Party of the Philippines (CCP) and/or the New People's Army, the latter being
the military arm of the former for the purpose of overthrowing the government
of the Republic of the Philippines or any of its political subdivisions through
armed revolution, force, violence, deceit, subversion, and other illegal means
with the covert assistance and support of a foreign power in order to establish
therein a totalitarian regime sub­ject to alien control and domination."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners Saturnino Ocampo, Antonio Liao, and Ramon Isberto
are presently detained at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><i style="">Bagong</i></st1:placename></st1:place><i style=""> Diwa</i>, Taguig, Metro-Manila, while the
petitioners Ester Ceniza-Isberto and Evelyn Sarmiento are on temporary
release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said Saturnino Ocampo was
arrested and detained on January 14, 1976 by virtue of the Arrest, Search and
Seizure Order (ASSO) No. 589, issued by the Secretary of National Defense,
while Antonio Liao and Ramon Isberto were arrested and detained on February 9,
1977 and November 10, 1977, by ASSO Nos. 76-124 and 4391, respectively,
likewise issued by the Secretary of National Defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case against the herein petitioners was initially set for
arraignment and hearing on January 24, 1979, but in view of the motion of the
accused for deferment on the ground that they had no sufficient time to prepare
their case, the respondent Military Com­mission reset the hearing to February
23, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of February 23,
1979, the herein petitioners filed a (1) Motion to Quash, on the grounds of
alleged denial of equal protection of the laws in that Letter of Instruction
No. 772, dated November 27, 1978, which directed the filing henceforth of all
criminal cases with the civil courts, was not applied in their case; alleged <i>ex
post facto</i> application of Presidential Decree No. 885; and alleged
duplicity of charges with respect to Saturnino Ocampo who had been accused of
rebellion in another case; (2) Motion for Bill of Particulars; and (3) Motion
for Discovery.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said motions were opposed by the prosecution and thereafter,
the respondent "Commission, in closed session, with the members consulting
with one another, after giving due consideration to the arguments in support of
the three motions of the defense, as well as the arguments in opposition
thereo," denied the said three motions.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the herein petitioners and their co-accused were
ordered arraigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the said
petitioners refused to plead so that a plea of "Not Guilty" was
ordered entered for each of them by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial of the case, however, was postponed
to a later date to afford the accused therein the opportunity to challenge the
rulings of the respondent military commission before this Honorable Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present <span class="GramE">petition for <i>habeas
corpus</i> and prohibition or <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary injunction or
restraining order</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for,
the corresponding summons and a temporary restraining order were issued by the
Court and the respondents were restrained from proceeding further with the
trial of the herein petitioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not petitioners are entitled to be
released on account of the public statements made by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

investigation in the case of petitioner Romeo Enriquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in view of respondents' manifestation
that, in the interest of aid­ing the resolution of the cases at bar, Lt. Col.
Cunanan was willing to withdraw from the respondent Commission, as in fact he
has been relieved, at his request, of his duties in the Commission per
respondents' manifestation dated February 14, 1979, and that respondents were
will­ing to conduct another preliminary investigation of the case of petitioner
Enriquez, the two issues in question may be deemed moot and academic.)</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In L-49571<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">11.<span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">Whether</span> the filing of
Criminal Case SMC-1-1 for rebellion placed the petitioners concerned in
jeopardy of conviction for the same offense a second time." <span class="GramE">(pp. 2023, Respondents' Memorandum.)</span></p>

<blockquote>"At this stage of our jurisprudence governing the issues thus
presented by petitioners, a lengthy disquisi­tion, demonstrating the
implausibility of their conten­tions seems superfluous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matters discussed and vigo­rously
insisted upon by counsel are already settled ones, not only in <i style="">Aquino vs. Enrile, L-35546, </i><st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="9"><i style="">September
 17, 1974</i></st1:date><i style="">, 59 SCRA 183</i>
but also in a number of subsequent cases of the same nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say here that with the
proclamation of martial law and the concomitant suspension of the privilege of
the <i>writ of habeas corpus</i>, at least as a rule, claims of denial of
speedy trial are unavailing, what with the recognized authority of the
government or the administrator of the martial law to detain persons even only
for preventive purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to how long
such preventive detention <span class="GramE">can last would</span> necessarily
depend on the circumstances and the sound discretion of the ad­ministrator,
even if there are members of the Court who hold the view that the Supreme Court
may in cases of demonstrated grave and palpable abuse of discretion
intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners who are
detained (some of them are not) have been apprehended on suspicion, if not
charges of <i>rebellion</i> and <i>subversion</i> by virtue of arrest, search
and seizure orders issued by the Minister of National Defense under authority
of the President, and it is, therefore, with more reason that they cannot
invoke <i style="">habeas corpus</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Whatever, We have carefully gone over the respective claims
of the parties relative to the causes for the de­lay or protraction of the
proceedings against petitioners, and We are satisfied that under existing
rulings of this Court, the circumstances revealed in the recorded proceed­ings
before and after their cases reached respondent Mili­tary Commission do not
warrant their release on <i style="">habeas corpus</i>
on the ground of denial of speedy trial, if only because in practically all
instances of postponement or transfer deplored by petitioners, the reasons were
either unavoidable or demanded by the nature of the proceedings, and in some
instances done upon direct or indirect request of petitioners themselves.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While perhaps there might be ground to hold that official and
formal pronouncements of the President on public occasions of importance, such
as those referred to in the petition, might come within the contemplation of
the word 'acts' in Section 3 (2), Article XVII of the Philippine Constitution
of 1973, albeit it must be noted that the same provision refers to those
'promulgated' and not merely delivered orally, the point is that, as contended
and explained by the Solicitor Gen­eral, (Pp. 33-43, Respondents' Memo) the
statements of the President before the U.P. Law Alumni Association on January
7, 1977, the Foreign Correspondence Association of the Philippines on June 3,
1977 and the 8th World Law Conference on August 21, 1977 do not include the
situation in which the petitioners find themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to think too much bad faith on the part
of the Presi­dent to maintain that were his intention in those state­ments
invoked by petitioners was to have them released, actually he had in mind not
to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those statements of the
President must not be taken out of context to give them a meaning farthest from
the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were uttered to reassure
all and sundry of the deep regard and respect the President has for individual
rights and liberties, and to accuse him practically of duplicity and of
offering false hopes for political purposes is certainly incompatible with
intelligent and conventional knowledge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The jurisdiction of military commissions to hear and
determine the cases of rebellion and subversion of petitioners is now
indubitable, in the light of the existing rulings of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that civil courts are open and
are functioning normally is of no consequence in this respect, as <span class="GramE">We</span> shall explain later.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For in addition to the foregoing, the Court re­serves the
preparation of a more extended opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Time constraint related to the steps needed for the earliest lifting of
martial law require that this deci­sion be released soonest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are indeed other considerations related
to the points above-discussed that render the plea of petitioners for the
granting of the relief they pray for unavailing, and We propose to dwell on
them soon enough in such more extended opinion, which would necessarily include
the disposition of the remain­ing points in the petitions, namely, (1)
duplicity in the charges, (2) need for a bill of particulars, (3) en­titlement
of petitioners to discovery and most important of all, (4) their claim to a
right to a preliminary hear­ing on the voluntariness of their supposed
confessions as well as their other right to counsel during custodial
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these issues are
worthy of fur­ther elaborate disquisition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We shall do so in due time, but <span class="GramE">Our</span> conclusion
in regard to them is that petitioners have not successfully shown any
substantial breach of the fundamental law of the land nor of their inherent
right and liberties, when measured alongside the imperatives of national
security and survival."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Whatever skepticism may exist as to the continued suspension of
the privelege of the <i style="">writ of habeas
corpus</i> and the power of the respondent military commission to try the
petitioners in view of the lifting of martial law, should be dispelled by the
clear mandate of Proclamation No. 2045, dated <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1981</st1:date>, which categorically provides, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x
x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President/Prime
Minister of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the
Constitution, do hereby revoke Procla­mation No. 1081 (Proclaiming a State of
Martial Law in the Philippines) and Proclamation No. 1104 (Declaring the

<blockquote>"<i style="">General Order No. 8 is

prosecution of the cases difficult, if not impossible</i>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to Article XVII, Section 3, Paragraph 2 of the
Constitution, all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts
promulgated, issued or done by the incumbent President constitute part of the
law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding, and effective even

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent on the grounds stated in my separate opinions in <u>Aquino
vs. Military Commission </u><u><span style="">No. </span>2</u>
(63 SCRA 546) and in the latest cases of <u>Buscayno vs. Enrile</u> (L-47185,
January 15, 1981, reported in 102 SCRA 7, 21), <u>Sison vs. Enrile</u>
(L-49579, January 15, 1981, reported in 102 SCRA 33, 38) and <u>Luneta vs.
Special Military Commission No. 1</u>, cited in the majority opinion of Mr. <span class="GramE">Justice Con­cepcion (102 SCRA 56, 68).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">These cases were all decided before the President's issuance of
Proclamation No. 2045 on January 17, 1981 revoking his previous proclamations
of martial law (Nos. 1081 and 1104) as well as General Order No. 8, directing
that "the military tribunals created pursuant thereto are hereby dissolved
upon final determination of cases pend­ing therein which may not be transferred
to the civil courts without irreparable prejudice to the state in view of the
rules on double jeop­ardy, or other circumstances which render further
prosecution of the cases difficult, if not impossible."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Sison</u> particularly, the Court in dismissing the
petition, unanimously noted that "(T<span class="GramE">)he</span> President
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has an­nounced that the military tribunals are being phased out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is re­ported that the Ministry of Justice
is now taking steps to transfer cases pending before the military tribunals to
the civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the issues
raised by the petitioners have become moot and academic."</p>

<p class="BODY">With the issuance of Proclamation 2045 and the revocation of the
General Order creating military tribunals, and pursuant to the Court's
above-quoted pronouncement in <u>Sison</u> on the phaseout of military
tribunals, there is no longer any justification for subjecting
petitioners-civilians to trial by military commissions in derogation of the
judicial power vested exclusively in the civil courts.</p>
