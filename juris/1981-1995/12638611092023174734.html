<p class="BODY">This petition is not meritorious and the extraordinary writ
sought cannot issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, attention should focus on the well-settled and
oft-cited rule that the findings of facts of the labor arbiter and respondent
commission are generally accorded not only respect but, at times, even the
stamp of finality where such findings are duly supported by substantial evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Consistent with this doctrinal precept, where the administrative body
conversely finds that there is insubstantial evidence to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">support the allega</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:33.0pt">t</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ions
of either party, such finding should be accorded equal acceptance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the determination of whether or not the quantum of proof was
satisfied by a party contending for a particular proposition, the procedure by
which issues are resolved based only on position papers, affidavits and or
documentary evidence, if agreed upon by the parties may be availed of by the
arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the due process clause.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

choose, if he deems it necessary, to set the case for hearing on the merits where
witnesses may be presented and examined by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In both instances, however, the burden of
proving that the termination was for valid or authorized cause rests on the
employer.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The administrative
tribunal below ruled that petitioner failed to discharge said burden of proof,
holding that there is no substantial evidence to support the validity of
private respondent's dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The labor arbiter and respondent
commission correctly faulted petitioner for not presenting the requisite evidence

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Thus, as found by the

light on, and thereby ascertain the truth of, private respondent's claim that
all his transactions were in order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">If it is true that the
records are incomplete or had been tampered with through acts ascribable to
private respondent, the production thereof would undoubtedly help in
substantiating the position of petitioner, since unauthorized spoliation or <span class="SpellE">eloignment</span> of evidence is always held against the one
responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, respondent Sousa having claimed to have issued receipts or turned
over the payments to the company, despite the denial of the customers in their
affidavits,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the production of the pertinent company records
was definitely called for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot but
view with doubt the reason for such omission by petitioner considering that it
was in total and exclusive control of such records and could have easily
presented the same before the arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The unfavorable presumption that such records if produced would be
adverse to petitioner irresistibly suggests itself.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

vital document which was not presented was the quarterly audit report although
its importance and </span>significance is obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As respondent labor arbiter noted, "(f)<span class="SpellE">rom</span> this testimony of witness <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span>,
it is, therefore, clear that the charges of irregular transactions which were

submitted to Jose D. <st1:city><st1:place>Palma</st1:place></st1:city>, Jr.
arose not from the complaints/reports of the different customers/outlets of the
company but from the quarterly audit report allegedly conducted by <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Butron</span>, and the
statements contained in the two reports, together with the supporting documents."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Aside from the
non-presentation of the necessary </span>documentary evidence, petitioner also
chose not to call any of the complaining customers during the proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While, in certain cases, the affidavits of
the witnesses may suffice, there are cases where mere affidavits, being
actually hearsay and untested by cross-examination, are not enough to satisfy
the quantum of proof required by law, especially where the statements of the
affiants are <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>, and the labor arbiter
should properly require the presentation of testimonial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The party who opts not to present his
witnesses under such circumstances must suffer the consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This last situation obtains in the present
proceeding and the case of customer <span class="SpellE">Lilibeth</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Sarol</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> may be cited <span class="SpellE"><u>exempli</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span>.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Sarol</span> denied the
accounts covered by Invoices Nos. 47261 and 47262, dated March 30, 1981, for
the reason that both accounts had already been liquidated but no liquidation
receipts were issued, thus making it appear that said invoices were
fictitious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Sousa denied the
charge stating that he was then grounded for one (1) month and a relief
salesman, Butch <span class="SpellE">Basa</span>, took over his route.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Sarol</span> stopped patronizing the company's products because of
a heated argument between her and <span class="SpellE">Basa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span>
was reminded by Sousa that when they visited the canteen where <span class="SpellE">Sarol</span> was the concessionaire, they found the empty bottles
which were allegedly returned by said customer to liquidate her accounts.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It was, therefore, obvious and imperative for petitioners to present not only
said customer but also Butch <span class="SpellE">Basa</span> to disprove private
respondent's allegations, but petitioner, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for
reasons </span>of its own, preferred not to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same is true with respect to the other customers whose
statements made in their respective affidavits should have been substantiated
by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">their </span>testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Worse, the absence of opportunity to confront
these complaining customers is a circumstance that undoubtedly weakens
petitioner's position, considering that, whether objected to or not, hearsay
evidence has no probative value,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
especially where the same was challenged and remains unexplained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus it was observed by respondent labor
arbiter that "(a)s shown during the <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1983</st1:date> investigation, Sousa was even asked by
investigator <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span> if he was willing to meet the
particular customers who made the complaint against him and there was a
positive answer made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As borne out by
the records, there was not a single instance during the investigation where
Sousa was allowed to meet or confront any of the alleged complaining
customers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he was refrained
(sic) by <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span> to conduct by himself a way to
arrive at the truth as to how the customers could have denied their accountabilities
with the company (Ans. 63, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">folio </span>47,
id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This will totally debunk
respondent's allegation that complainant Sousa 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
was given every opportunity to meet face-to-face all the customers and outlets
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x' relative to his irregular transactions with
them."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the charge that Sousa incurred excessive absences
without permission, we find that the labor arbiter is correct in saying that
the only semblance of evidence which gives the impression that Sousa had
incurred absences without permission was an alleged certification signed by <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span> and three other co-supervisors, namely, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, Mateo Medina and Rolando <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>,
Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the certification cannot be
given credence because it is a mere <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy
bearing no date and was apparently signed after the investigation of <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arbiter also correctly noted that the
supervisors could not have certified that Sousa was absent on March 7, 26, and
31 and <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1983</st1:date> because
the certification itself reveals that they were not on duty on said dates.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

and <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1983</st1:date>, Sousa
explained that he submitted a personal leave authority for emergency leave of
absence for personal reasons, for which purpose <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span>

<p class="BODY">Neither can we disregard the various circumstances that
contradict or cast doubts on the charges made by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Particularly, the records reveal that:</p>

while he (Sousa) was at that time on grounded status and while the
investigation of the charges against him for illegal transaction was in
progress, specifically during the dates, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>March 11, 14, May 23 and 24, 1983, his
supervisor and investigator, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span> Jr.,
had already prepared and submitted on <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1983</st1:date> a written report to the manager, Jose D. Palma, Jr.,
together with the denials/confirmations of the different customers (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. '2', '4' and '5', Folio 65, 67 and 72, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A glimpse of said denials/confirmation of
said customers, which are confirmation slip and affidavit forms, will show the
dates 'March 11, 1983', which clearly support the assertion of Sousa that they
were prepared and procured by his supervisor (<span class="SpellE">Baterina</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And a further glance below said documents
will reveal that they appear to have been prepared and secured on March 11,
1983 but were signed by said customers concerned on different dates, which were
March 14, 15 and 16, 1983, and notarized only on one date, July 13, 1983 about
four (4) months after the investigation and submission of the two reports
(Folio 111 and 121, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the

<blockquote>"The second report, dated June 28, 1983 (folio 121, id.), will
further unmask the devious plan of Sousa's superiors, which shows that while on
said date he (Sousa) was recommended for dismissal, they waited up to October
11, 1983, or after three months and thirteen days, to execute the same, thus
prolonged the anxiety and agony of Sousa (folio 4, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether Sousa's case was reviewed by
respondent's legal department and his dismissal bears its imprimatur, witness <span class="SpellE">Baterina</span> does not know (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, pp.
