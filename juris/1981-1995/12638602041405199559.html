No. RBIV-9706-77, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Loida</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario vs. Christian Literature Crusade."</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in January, 1975, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Loida</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rosario </span>(hereinafter

the services of <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario on the ground of
incompetence was filed by Crusade with the Ministry of Labor and

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1982</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1982</st1:date>,
a writ of execution was issued by the Labor Arbiter upon motion of <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, there being no appeal (pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1982</st1:date>, the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in the amount of THIRTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED
EIGHTY PESOS (P13<span class="GramE">,680.00</span>) computed on the basis of del
Rosario's P380.00 monthly salary was satisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, on the issue of reinstatement, the Sheriff stated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>his return that del Rosario was not
reinstated in view of the "Manifestation and Motion to Hold in Abeyance
the Execution of the Decision Per Reinstatement of the Complainant <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> del Rosario," filed by Crusade on August 31,
1982.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 2, 1983, del Rosario filed an "Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion for the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">y</span>
Issuance of an Alias Writ of Execution" praying therein for reinstatement
with payment of allowances and 13th month pay from 1976, the date of her
dismissal, up to January, 1983, amounting to P20,072.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="2">February <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">28, </span>1983</st1:date>, an Alias Writ of

Rosario's reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1983</st1:date>,
a Manifestation and Motion was again filed by <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario alleging that the computation of her <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
should include the allowances and 13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="6">June
 7, 1983</st1:date>, the Labor Arbiter resolved the question in this wise (p.
37, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

<blockquote>"It might be noted that the Decision of Hon. <span class="SpellE">Lacandola</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> states that
complainant should be paid <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for a period of
three (3) years without deductions from possible earnings elsewhere and without
loss of seniority rights and other privileges formerly appertaining to her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The basis of the computation of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">backwages</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>of the complainant is the amount
appearing in the complaint which is P380.00 a month that was in 1976 which is
her latest salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It might be noted
that the prevailing minimum wage during this time is P260.00 plus P110.00
monthly allowance, and without loss of seniority rights and other privileges
formerly appertaining to her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The computation, we believe is correct and the Motion for <span class="SpellE">Recomputation</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Backwages</span>
filed by the complainant is hereby denied and let an Alias Writ of Execution
for the reinstatement of the complainant be issued."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1983</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>second
Alias Writ of execution for the purpose of reinstatement of <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario, which was not satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motions for <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> of her <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> having been denied, <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (hereinafter
referred to as NLRC) regarding the interpretation of the <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1982</st1:date> decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span>the Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1986</st1:date>, the NLRC rendered a
decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads (pp.
38-39, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, with the above modification, the appealed Order is
<span class="GramE">Affirmed</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, let this case be remanded to the Labor Arbiter of or<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">i</span>gin for execution of the
reinstatement aspect of the <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="3">31 March
 1982</st1:date> Decision and likewise of the award hereto indicated after
proper computation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The modification referred to states (p. 38, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

<blockquote>"The term ‘without loss of other privileges formerly
appertaining to her’ refers to other benefits that may have accrued to her had
she not been dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, this
includes the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> allowances, service incentive
leave pay and 13th month pay as sought for in the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appearing, however, that the amount of
P380.00 set forth in the complaint and taken as the basis in the determination
of complainant's <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> already covers her monthly
allowance, the same should therefore be excluded in this award.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And for purposes of quantifying the other two
(2) remaining claims, the computation must be reckoned from <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="11">20 November 1976</st1:date>, the date of her
termination, until <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="11">20 November 1979</st1:date>,
or for a period of three (3) years as directed in the subject decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On February 9, 1987, del Rosario filed a Partial Motion for
Reconsideration before the NLRC arguing that the latter erred in “holding that
the amount of P380.00 covers the allowance and that her monthly rate was
P260.00 and prayed for payment of additional <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
based on a computation of P380.00 monthly rate with corresponding privileges
and benefits on the basis of said monthly rate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, a Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Execution was filed
anew by del Rosario, alleging that based on her computation, she is entitled to
<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> including living allowance and 13th month
pay in the total amount P80,329.15 from September 1, 1982 to March 15, 1987 and
prayed for the payment of the same and reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1987</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter issued a Writ of Execution, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads (p. 44, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

ordered and already satisfied, commencing from the period when the Sheriff was
unable to effect reinstatement per decision dated August 29, 1986, as per
official computation of the Research and Information Unit (attached as Annex
"A" of this Writ) and thereafter turn over said amount to this office
for further disposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In case you fail to collect said amount in cash, you are
directed to cause the satisfaction of the same from the movable goods and
immovable properties of respondent not exempt from execution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"You are further directed to return this Writ within fifteen
(15) days from compliance thereof together with your corresponding report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"You may collect legal fees from the respondent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1987</st1:date>,
the Motion to Quash Writ of Execution was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the present petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Crusade alleged that on <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1987</st1:date>, the Deputy Sheriff garnished its bank deposits amounting
to more than P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">August
 3, 1987</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span> issued a temporary restraining
order enjoining the NLRC, thru Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span>, from releasing the garnished amounts of
money to del Rosario.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in her
comment, del Rosario alleged that the amount of P7<span class="GramE">,771.88</span>
has been released to her before the issuance of the temporary restraining
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:50.0pt">is w</span>hether
or not <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario is entitled to additional <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="9">September
 1, 1982</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Crusade alleges that the questioned writ of execution is null and
void for the following reasons: (1) it does not conform to, but is even <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the decisions dated March 31, 1982 and August
29, 1986 which decisions merely awarded del Rosario "<span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
for a period of three (3) years without deductions from possible earnings
elsewhere, without loss of seniority rights and other privileges formerly
appertaining to her; (2) del Rosario's <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P13,680.00 had already been fully paid in 1982;
and (3) it commands collection from Crusade of P84,681.96 representing del
Rosario's <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from September 1, 1982 until
March 15, 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unless the subject writ
of execution is declared null and void, NLRC would be allowed to award <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario for more
than the three (3) years maximum, or seven (7) years and nine (9) months to be
more precise, or without any limit for that matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario argues
that the challenged writ of execution is based on the obstinate refusal of
Crusade to reinstate her and not on the decisions dated <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1982</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The power of the NLRC and/or the Labor Arbiter to grant or extend <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for refusal of the employer enjoined to reinstate
terminated workers is recognized in this jurisdiction in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>case of TUPAS Local Chapter No.
979 vs. NLRC (G.R. Nos. 60532-33, November 5, 1985, 139 SCRA 478).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled rule that the execution of judgment must
conform to that which is ordained or decreed in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision (<span class="SpellE">Laingo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>, G.R. No. L-35833, <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1984</st1:date>, 130 SCRA 144; National Steel Corporation
vs. National Labor Relations Commission and <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Remolado</span>, G.R. No. 74711, <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where the writ of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">execution </span>is
not in harmony with and exceeds the judgment which gives it life, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the writ </span>has <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pro</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

is so because once a judgment has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
or partially executed as in this case, it may no longer be amended, modified or
altered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What remains to be done is
purely the ministerial enforcement or execution of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">of </span>defiance
or non-compliance with the writ of execution, as in this case, where Crusade
paid del Rosario three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> but failed
and refused and still fails and refuses to reinstate her despite several writs
of execution, the remedy is not for the grant in another writ of execution of
continuing <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> up to the time of actual
reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grant of additional <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to serve as damages or as penalty to Crusade for
persistently refusing to reinstate del Rosario has no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">basis in the decision sought to be enforced and hence; it may not be resorted
to in order to compel reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
remedy is provided in the case of D.M. <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>, Inc.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Pucan</span>, et al., G.R. No. 71413, March 21, 1988,
159 SCRA 107, wherein an alias writ of execution was likewise issued directing
payment of additional <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> after the prior award
of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> equivalent to five (5) years and seven
(7) months had been fully satisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court, in nullifying the order for payment of additional sums, therein held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"To ensure compliance with the court's order, and realizing
the stubborn refusal to reinstate him, petitioner (sic) should have resorted to
more drastic remedies such as the filing of a motion to cite petitioner in
contempt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this way, prompt compliance
could have resulted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario should have filed a motion to cite Crusade in contempt for refusing to
reinstate her despite several writs of execution issued by the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The case of TUPAS Local
Chapter No. 979 vs. NLRC, <u>supra</u>, relied upon by del Rosario in support
of her claim for continuing <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, is
inapplicable to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
should be noted that the Court's departure therein from the usual equivalent of
the three years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> generally awarded by this
Court was still within its power to do, the reinstatement of </span>the workers
therein being by virtue of a return-to-work order, not by virtue of a final and
<span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
Free Workers Front vs. CIR, G.R. No. L-29356, October 31, 1974, 60 SCRA 408,
this Court, in departing from the general rule, merely upheld the trial court's
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">decision, which was not yet final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, </span>awarding the employees therein unlawfully
dismissed full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification from
dismissal to reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Likewise, in National Shipyards and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Steel Corporation vs. CIR, G.R. No.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> L-32724, June 28, 1974, 57 SCRA 642, this
Court merely upheld the industrial court's questioned orders and resolutions in
implementation of this Court's long final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision in a previous case involving exactly the same subject matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said orders and resolutions provided </span>for
the employee's reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">until</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> <u>actually</u> <u>reinstated</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>In upholding the same, this Court said that the matter of
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> was long resolved and
may no longer be reopened.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, what
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> is the decision of the
Labor Arbiter </span>granting reinstatement and only three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as
far as this case is concerned, the issue of whether or not del Rosario's <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be limited to three (3) years or continued
indefinitely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">until actual reinstatement
can no longer be raised or reopened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
lengthy discussion made by Crusade that the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
up to the maximum of three (3) </span>years is not without justification and
the corresponding retort of del Rosario citing TUPAS, <u>supra</u>, where this
Court granted <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification until
reinstatement, are, therefore, irrelevant and beside the point.</p>
