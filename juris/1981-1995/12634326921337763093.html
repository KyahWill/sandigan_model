<p class="BODY" style="margin-top: 10pt;">On 15 January 1985, Respondent GCL
filed with Petitioner a claim for refund <span style="">in
</span>the amounts of P1,312.66 withheld by Anscor Capital and Investment Corp.,
and P2,064.15 <span style="">by </span>Commercial Bank
of Manila.  On 12 February 1985, it
filed a second claim for refund of the amount of P7,925.00 withheld by Anscor,
stating in both letters that it disagreed with the collection of the 15% final
withholding tax from the interest income as it is an entity fully exempt from
income tax as provided under Rep. Act No. 4917 in relation to Section 56 (b)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Tax Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The refund requested having been denied, Respondent GCL elevated
the <span style="">matter </span>to respondent Court
of Tax Appeals (CTA).  The latter ruled
in favor of GCL, holding that employees' trusts are <span style="">exempt </span>from the 15% final withholding tax on interest income and
ordering a refund of the tax withheld.  Upon appeal, originally to this Court, but referred to respondent Court
of Appeals, the latter upheld the CTA Decision.  Before us now, Petitioner assails that disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that under Rep. Act No. 1983, which took effect on 22
June 1957, amending Sec. 56(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code,
for brevity), employees' trusts were exempt from income tax.  That law provided:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 56.  <u>Imposition

employees, or both, for the purpose of distributing to such employees the

such plan, x x x "<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 3 June 1977, Pres. Decree No. 1156 provided, for the first
time, for the withholding from the interest on bank deposits at the source of a
tax of fifteen per cent (15%) of said interest.  However, it also allowed a specific exemption in its Section 53,

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, on 15 October 1984, Pres. Decree No. 1959
was issued, amending the aforestated provisions to read:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.  Section 21(d)
of this Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">(d) </span><u>On interest

as provided in Sections 53 and 54 of this Code.</p>

foreign corporations shall be subject to a 15% final tax to be collected and

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.  Section 53(d)

<p class="2Q">Sec. 53(d) (1).  <u>Withholding

yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitutes a final tax equal
to fifteen per centum (15%) of the interest on deposits or yield or any other
monetary benefit from deposit substitutes and from trust fund and similar
arrangements."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the exemption from withholding tax on
interest on bank deposits previously extended by <span style="">Pres. </span>Decree No. 1739 if the recipient (individual or
corporation) of the interest income is exempt from income taxation, and the
imposition of the preferential tax rates of the recipient of the income <span style="">is </span>enjoying preferential income tax
treatment, were both abolished by Pres. Decree No. 195 1959.  Petitioner thus submits that the deletion of
the exempting and preferential tax treatment provisions under the old law is a
clear manifestation that the single 15% now 2<span style="">0%) </span>rate is imposable on all interest incomes from <span style="">deposits, </span>deposit substitutes, trust
funds and similar arrangements, regardless of the tax status or character of
the recipients thereof.  In short,
petitioner's position is that from 15 October 1984 when Pres. Decree No, 1959
was promulgated, employees' trusts ceased to be exempt and thereafter became
subject to the final withholding tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, GCL contends that the tax exempt status of
employees' trusts applies to all kinds of taxes, including the final
withholding tax on interest income.  That exemption, according to GCL, is derived from Section 56(b) and not
from Section 21(d) or 24(cc) of the Tax Code, as<span style=""> </span>argued by Petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue for determination is whether or not the GCL Plan
is exempt from the final withholding tax on interest income from money placements
and purchase of treasury bills required by Pres. Decree No. 1959.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We uphold the exemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, it is significant to note that the GCL Plan was
qualified as exempt from income tax by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in
accordance with Rep. Act No. 4917 approved on 17 June 1967.  This law specifically provided:</p>

<blockquote>SECTION 1.  <u>Any provision
of law to the contrary notwithstanding</u>, the retirement benefits received by
officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance
with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer shall be <u>exempt
from all taxes</u> and shall not be liable to attachment, levy or seizure by <span style="">or </span>under any <span style="">legal </span>or equitable process whatsoever except to pay a debt of the
official or employee concerned to the private benefit plan or that arising from
liability imposed in a criminal action;" x x x (emphasis ours).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In so far as employees’ trusts are concerned, the foregoing
provision should be taken in relation to then Section 56(b) (now 53[b]) of the <span style="">Tax </span>Code, as amended by Rep. Act No.
1983, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span>which took effect on 22 June
1957.  This provision specifically
exempted employees' trusts from income tax and is repeated hereunder for
emphasis:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 56.  Imposition
of Tax.  - (a) Application of tax.  - The taxes imposed by this Title upon
individuals shall apply to the income of estates or of any kind of property
held in trust,</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span style="">x x<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) Exception.  - The
tax imposed by this Title shall not apply to employee's trust which forms part
of a pension, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the
benefit of some or all of his employees x x x"<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The tax-exemption privilege of employees' trusts, as
distinguished from any other kind of property held in trust, springs from the
foregoing provision.  It is
unambiguous.  Manifest therefrom is that
the tax law has singled out employees' trusts for tax exemption.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And rightly so, by virtue of the <u><span style="">raison d'etre</span></u><span style=""> </span>behind
the creation of employees' trusts.  Employees' trusts or <span style="">benefit
plans normally provide economic assistance to </span>employees upon the
occurrence of certain contingencies, <span style="">particularly,
old age retirement, death, sickness, or </span>disability.  It provides security against certain hazards
to which members of the Plan may be exposed.  It is an Independent and additional source of protection for the working
group.  What is more, it is established
for their exclusive benefit and for no other purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tax advantage in Rep. Act No. 1983, Section 56(b), was
conceived in order to encourage the formation and establishment of such private
Plans for the benefit of laborers and employees outside of the Social Security
Act.  Enlightening is a portion of the
explanatory note to H.B. No. 6503, now R. A. 1983, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that under Section 17 of the Social Security Act,
all contributions collected and payments of sickness, unemployment, retirement,
disability and death benefits made thereunder <u>together with the income of
the pension trust</u> are exempt from any tax, assessment, fee, or charge, it <span style="">is </span>proposed that a similar system
providing for retirement, etc. benefits for employees outside the Social
Security Act be exempted from income taxes." (Congressional Record, House
of Representatives, Vol. IV, Part. 2, No. 57, p. 1859, May 3, 1957; cited in
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Visayan Electric Co., et al., G. R. No.
L-22611, 27 May 1968, 23 SCRA 715); underscoring supplied.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that tax-exemption is likewise to be enjoyed by the
income of the pension trust.  Otherwise,
taxation of those earnings would result in a diminution of accumulated income
and reduce whatever the trust beneficiaries would receive out of the trust
fund.  This would run afoul of the very
intendment of the law.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The deletion in Pres. Decree No. 1959 of the provisos regarding
tax exemption and preferential tax rates under the old law, therefore, can not
be deemed to extend to employees’ trusts.  Said Decree, being a general law, can not repeal by implication a specific
provision, Section 56(b) (now 53 [b]) in relation to Rep. Act No. 4917 granting
exemption from income tax to employees’ trusts.  Rep. Act 1983, which excepted employees' trusts in its Section
56(b) was effective on 22 June 1957 while Rep. Act No. 4917 was enacted on 17
June 1967, long before the issuance of Pres. Decree No. 1959 on 15 October
1984.  A subsequent statute, general in
character as to its terms and application, is not to be construed as repealing
a special or specific enactment, unless the legislative purpose to do so is
manifested.  This is so even if the
provisions of the latter are sufficiently comprehensive to include what was set
forth in the special act (Villegas v. Subido, G.R. No. L-31711, 30 September
1971, 41 SCRA 190).</p>

<p class="BODY">Notably, too, all the tax provisions herein treated of come under
Title II of the Tax Code on "Income Tax." Section 21(d), as amended
by Rep. Act No. 1959, refers to the final tax on individuals and falls under
Chapter II; Section 24(cc) to the final tax on corporations under Chapter III;
Section 53 on withholding of final tax to Returns and Payment of Tax under
Chapter VI; and Section 56(b) to tax on Estates and Trusts covered by Chapter
VII.  Section 56(b), taken in
conjunction with Section 56(a), <u>supra</u>, explictly excepts employees'
trusts from taxes imposed by this Title." Since the final tax and the
withholding thereof are embraced within the title on "Income Tax." it
follows that said trust must be deemed exempt therefrom.  Otherwise, the exception becomes
meaningless.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no denying either that the final withholding tax is
collected from <u>income</u> in respect of which employees' trusts are declared
exempt (Sec. 56[b], now 53[b], Tax Code).  The application of the withholdings system to interest on bank deposits
or yield from deposit substitutes is essentially to maximize and expedite the
collection of <u>income</u> taxes by requiring its payment at the source.  If an employees' trust like the GCL enjoys <span style="">a </span>tax-exempt status from income, we
see no logic in withholding a certain percentage of that income which it is not
supposed to pay in the first place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also relies on Revenue Memorandum Circular 31-84,
dated 30 October 1984, and Bureau of Internal Revenue Ruling No. 027-e-000-00-005-85,
dated 14 January 1985, as authorities for the argument that Pres. Decree No.
1959 withdrew the exemption of employees' trusts from the withholding of the
final tax on interest income.  Said
Circular and Ruling pronounced that the deletion of the exempting and
preferential tax treatment provisions by Pres. Decree No. 1959 is a clear
manifestation that the single 15% tax rate is imposable on all interest income
regardless of the tax status or character of the recipient thereof.  But since we herein rule that Pres. Decree
No. 1959 did not have the effect of revoking the tax exemption enjoyed by
employees' trusts, reliance on those authorities is now misplaced.</p>
