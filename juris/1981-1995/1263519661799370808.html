<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The Order also directed the seizure of
logs already cut and placed them under the temporary custody of the respondent
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants, aside from filing an answer, filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint and to reconsider the preliminary injunction on the
ground of lack of notice and hearing, lack of jurisdiction of the court over
the subject matter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the case,
and improper venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the motion could be heard, Judge <span class="SpellE">Gapultos</span>
unfortunately died. There being no replacement, the defendants were faced with
the immediate implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction by
respondent Sheriff Ramon <span class="SpellE">Progalidad</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the defendants filed the instant special civil
action <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span><i>certiorari</i>
with application for injunction, assailing the order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of </span>preliminary injunction dated June 8, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">1982 of </span>the respondent court for being a patent nullity on the
same grounds raised before the trial court, namely: (a) that the Order was
issued without notice and hearing; (b) that respondent court did not have
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action; and (c) that venue was
improperly laid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the assailed Order of <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="6">June <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">8, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> was </span>issued in violation of Section 5
of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, as amended on <st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1982</st1:date> by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 224, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span> <u>Preliminary injunction
not granted without notice; issuance of restraining order</u>. - No <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">preliminary injunction shall </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">be granted without notice to the defendant. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">If </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

injunction was made, may issue a restraining order to be effective only for a
period of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">twenty days from date </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of its issuance. Within the said twenty-day
period, the judge must cause an order to be served on the defend</span>ant,
requiring him to show cause, at a specified time and place, why the injunc<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">tion should not be granted, and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">determine within the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">same </span></span>period whether or not the preliminary injunction shall
be granted, and shall accordingly issue the corresponding order. In the event
that the ap<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">plication for preliminary
injunction is </span>denied, the restraining order is deemed automatically
vacated."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted amendatory provision was adopted as a reaction
against the indiscriminate issuance of <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>preliminary injunctions which, not
infrequently, converted the writ from an instrument in furtherance of justice
to a shield for injustice. <span class="SpellE">Thereunder</span>, in no case may
a preliminary injunction be issued without notice. The rule is absolute. Nevertheless,
if it appears that great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant
before his application for preliminary injunction could be heard on notice, the
judge could issue a temporary restraining order with a limited life of 20 days
from date of issue. If before the expiration of the 20-day period, the
application for preliminary injunction is denied, the tem<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">porary restraining order would thereby be
deemed automatically vacated. But if no action is taken by the judge on the
application for preliminary injunction within the said 20 days, the temporary
restraining order would automatically expire on the 20th day by the sheer force
of law, no judicial declaration to that effect being necessary. Thus, by the
terms of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
224, a temporary, restraining order can no longer exist indefinitely; it has
become truly temporary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">There </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">another reason, equally compelling, why the
assailed order of preliminary injunction must be struck down. The respondent
court has no jurisdiction to hear and decide the basic complaint which raised
issues arising from supposed intra-corporate machinations involving alleged
falsification by corporate officers of corporate records, misappropriation of
corporate funds, fraudulent transfer/acquisition of shares of stocks, and
usurpation of corporate offices. These are clearly intra-corporate and kindred
disputes which fall within the </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">exclusive
and </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">original j</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">urisdiction</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Presidential Decree No. 902-A which took effect on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">March 11, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">. This law reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evident purpose to law in investing a specialized
administrative body like the Securities and Exchange Commission with additional
adjudicatory powers over <span class="SpellE">intracorporate</span> and kindred
disputes is to promote dispatch arising from expertise enhanced by
specialization in the settlement of the said controversies. On this premise, it
would not really matter whether the acts or events giving rise to litigation
occurred before or after the adoption of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Presidential
Decree No. 902-<span class="GramE">A</span> on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">March 11, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">. Moreover, the settled rule on this point is
that the jurisdiction of a tribunal is determined by the statute in force at
the time of the commencement of the action. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">vs. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, 1 SCRA 860; </span><span class="SpellE">Aquizap</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, 21 SCRA 1434; People vs. Mariano, 71
SCRA 600.)</span> There is no reason why this principle should not be applied
to both judicial and quasi-judicial bodies. Therefore, when the derivative suit
here in question was filed on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">May 24, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> by private respondent with the Court of
First Instance of South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, the said Court had
no more <span class="GramE">jurisdiction</span> to entertain it, jurisdiction
over intra-corporate disputes having </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

transferred by law to the Securities and Exchange Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing considerations make it unnecessary to rule on the
issue of venue.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby granted. The questioned
Order of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dated <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1982</st1:date> is set aside and the complaint ordered
