Municipality of Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the

him stab wounds which would ordinarily cause his death, thus performing all the
acts of execution which should have produced the crime of homicide, but
nevertheless, did not produce it by reason of causes independent of their will,
that is due to the timely and able medical attendance rendered to said Benito
Abrogar, which prevented his death.” (RTC Decision, p. 1; Rollo, p. 22)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

treachery, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack,
assault and stab one Benito Abrogar with a bladed weapon on the different parts

caused his death.” (RTC Decision, p. 2; Rollo, p. 236)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 18, 1986, all
the accused in Criminal Case</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">No. 65155 except Mayoling Sabellano who had
remained at large up to the present time, entered a plea of “not guilty” with
the assistance of counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
accused Vivencio and Jaime jumped bail, hence, they were tried <u>in</u> </span><u>absentia</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 8, 1987, the accused-appellant <span style="">Wesly </span>Sabellano, duly assisted by
counsel, pleaded not guilty to the offense charged in<span style=""> </span>Criminal Case No. 67688.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Initially, the case for frustrated homicide was dismissed for the
repeated failure of prosecution witnesses to appear in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the case was revived and
consolidated with the murder case after a motion <span style="">for </span>reconsideration and/or to revise case filed by the private
respondent, Walderita Abrogar, wife of the deceased Benito Abrogar, was granted
by the trial court in an Order dated January 12, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts in Criminal Case No. 65155 as summarized by
the trial court from the lone testimony of the prosecution witness Walderita
Abrogar are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x [O]n February 6, 1985, she was <span style="">in </span>her house at 536 Calbayog Street, Mandaluyong watching a wake
across the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A game had then been
in progress for about two (2) hours between one Julio Catayong and Wesly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few people were watching said game among
them, the son of the deceased, Almar Abrogar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Due to both players’ zealousness, a misunderstanding ensued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Julio cursed ‘putang ina mo’ and delivered a
fist blow to the rightside jaw of Wesly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Seeing the trouble erupt, Salvador, brother of Julio, pulled out a knife
and advanced towards Wesly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vivencio
Sabellano, at the same time, had also approached and held up Salvador
preventing the latter from attacking Wesly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As this occurred, Wesly went home and after getting hold of a knife,
rushed back and stabbed Salvador twice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the process, Wesly had held Salvador’s right arm and stabbed him with
the knife on his right hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Salvador
was released and ran to his Aunt’s house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Almar, who was then a mere three (3) arm-lengths (sic) away watching,
followed to see if Salvador’s wounds were serious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Salvador asked Almar to fetch a taxi to which
the latter obliged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the taxi
arrived however, its path was blocked by Wesly, Vivencio and Paulino
Sabellano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wesly confronted Almar and
said ‘putang ina mo huwag kang makialam bayaan mo siyang mamatay’ while pulling
out the knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almar ran to the house
and hid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased, Benito Abrogar,
was at that time fixing the toilet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hearing the commotion, he went out holding a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was met by Vivencio, Mayoling, Wesly and
Jaime who struck him with a bareta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mayoling and Wesly mauled Benito while Vivencio delivered a stab to the
back with a 29” knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benito fell to the
ground wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then picked-up by
his wife who, along with other relatives, took him to Nayan where a doctor
advised that he be taken to the Rizal Provincial Hospital and confined for ten
(10) days.” (RTC Decision, pp. 3-4; Rollo, pp. 24-25)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 67688, the pertinent facts that led to the
conviction of the accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano are stated by the trial
court, <u>to</u> <u><span style="">wit</span></u><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“On March 9, 1986, Benito and Walderita with Gertrudes Basilides
were walking along Cordillera Street near Sierra Madre Street on their way to
Divisoria to buy merchandise to be resold later in the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was 3:45 a.m. as they chanced upon the
group of Vivencio, Wesly, Jimmy and John Doe at a grocery store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Abrogars ignored them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further down the street however, Gertrudes
noticed that two (2) joggers, were coming up behind them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the joggers, Wesly, grabbed Walderita
with his left arm around her neck and warned her “huwag kang sisigaw, papatayin
kita kapag sumigaw ka”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
jogger, Vivencio, embraced Benito and stabbed the latter on the right
breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2) persons, Jaime and John
Doe came from Cordillera and Sierra Madre Streets and stabbed Benito in the
abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wesly released Walderita and
stabbed Benito <span style="">in </span>the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Benito dropped to the ground, his
assailants ran in different directions to escape and Walderita tried to help
Benito for home but he died shortly thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gertrudes was only an arm-length away when the attack occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With light coming from a nearby house, she was
able to recognize the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
also remembered the clothes that the attackers had worn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wesly was wearing a white sando and maong
pants; Jaime had an orange T-shirt and maong and Vivencio was in a black jacket
and maong pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing Benito fall to
the ground, Gertrudes looked <span style="">at </span>him
before going back to Calbayog Street to get help from their relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Walderita stayed with Benito until <span style="">help </span>arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then called <span style="">for </span>the police to bring the deceased to the <span style="">Municipal </span>Hall and later <span style="">to </span>Camp Crame for autopsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A request for autopsy (Exhibit “H”) was made
and a Certificate of Death (Exhibit “I”) was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Medico Legal Report M-0-418-86 (Exhibit D)
was issued on the findings as testified to by Dr. Moraleda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Walderita executed a statement (Exhibit “E”)
and so did Gertrudes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit “G”)”
(RTC Decision, pp. 4-5; Rollo, pp. 25-26)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After a joint trial on
the merits, the trial</span><span style=""> court </span><span style="">promulgated the questioned decision from

SABILLANO BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 67688 FOR MURDER.”
(Rollo, p. 52)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, we are constrained to review the trial court’s
decision <span style="">only </span>insofar as the
accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano’s conviction for the murder of Benito Abrogar
is concerned considering that with respect to the other accused-appellant
Vivencio Sabellano, an order dated June 8, 1990 was issued by the trial court
which states:</p>

<blockquote>“He who wants to avail of the processes of the Court must be within
the reach of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having escaped
from detention, accused Vivencio Sabellano’s Notice of Appeal through counsel
must perforce be DENIED DUE COURSE and it is hereby SO ORDERED.” (Records, p.
487)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Either by deliberate omission <span style="">or </span>on account of ignorance of the rules of procedure
specifically Section 18, Rule 114 and Section 8, Rule 124, the counsel for the
accused Vivencio Sabellano failed to seasonably question the above order which
by this time has become final and executory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well-settled is the rule that the right to appeal is a statutory right,
not a natural or inherent <span style="">one, </span>so
that the party who seeks to avail of the said right must comply with the
requirements of the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
the right to appeal is lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ozaete v.
Court of Appeals, 179 SCRA 800 [1989]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, as regards Criminal Case No. 65155 accused Vivencio <span style="">Sabellano, who was found guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated homicide, lost his right to appeal
from the trial court’s judgment of conviction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent Criminal Case No.
67688, the issue is whether or not the evidence for the prosecution establishes
the guilt of the accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of his prayer
for a reversal of the trial court’s verdict, the accused-appellant Wesly
Sabellano makes the following contentions in his brief, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses contained material inconsistencies and contradictions, so that the
trial court erred in giving much credence thereto; (b) that the complaining
witness, Walderita Abrogar, failed to immediately report to the police officer
who conducted the “on-the-spot investigation” on the day of the incident in
question that the Sabellanos were the persons responsible for the death of her
husband, Benito Abrogar; and (c) that the trial court unjustly failed to
appreciate the defense of alibi despite the fact that the credibility of the
prosecution witnesses who allegedly identified Benito’s assailants is highly
questionable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alleged
contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses alluded to by
the accused?appellant Wesly Sabellano are that while Walderita Abrogar
stated in her testimony in court that it was only on March 9, 1986, the day of
the fatal incident </span>that the other prosecution witnesses, Gertrudes
Baselides, accompanied the former and her husband, Benito Abrogar to Divisoria
to buy some merchandise, Gertrudes testified that she went with her uncle and
aunt, Benito and Walderita, to Divisoria everyday (Appellant’s Brief, pp.
22-23); that Walderita testified that when she and her deceased husband were
held up by the accused-appellants <span style="">Wesly
</span>and Vivencio Sabellano, respectively, Gertrudes ran back to her house <span style="">immediately, </span>while Gertrudes claimed
that she rema<span style="">i</span>ned at the scene
of the fatal incident while her uncle and aunt were embraced by the
accused-appellants until she saw her uncle being stabbed after which she ran
home (Appellants’ Brief, pp. 23-24); <span style="">that
</span><span style="">while </span>Walderita said in
open court that after the stabbing of her husband, she saw four (4) persons run
to different directions, some towards Libertad Street and the others towards
Sierra Madre Street, Gertrudes asserted that all the assailants ran towards
only one direction, towards the Producers Market (Appellants’ Brief, pp.
24-26); and that while Walderita claimed that <span style="">there were </span>police officers at the scene of the fatal incident
since she was the one who summoned them on March 9, 1986, Gertrudes
categorically stated <span style="">that </span>no
policeman arrived at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Appellants’ Brief, pp. 26-28)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The discrepancies pointed out by the accused-appellant Wesly
Sabellano are not only on minor details but they do not alter the fact that the
deceased Benito Abrogar was fatally stabbed on March 9, 1986 and that one of
the assailants was the accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The autopsy report (Exh. “D”; Records, p.
356) indicated that Benito suffered from cardio-respiratory arrest due to shock
and hemorrhage as a result of stab wounds of the trunk and upper extremity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Desiderio Moraleda, the medico-legal examiner
who conducted the autopsy on the deceased Benito Abrogar described in court the
nature of the six (6) stab wounds inflicted on the victim’s body and made a
conclusion that the mortal wound caused by a single-bladed knife was that
located on the right side of the chest and indicated as Stab Wound No. 1 in the
report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, June 6, 1989, pp. 6-7).</p>

<p class="BODY">The straight-forward and detailed testimonies of the other
prosecution witnesses, Walderita Abrogar and Gertrudes Baselides relating to
the fatal stabbing of Benito Abrogar clearly pinpointed the authors of the
crime under consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, April
12, 1988, pp. 10-14; TSN, August 25, 1988, pp. 3-5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inconsistencies and contradictions
specified by the accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano merely pertain to minor
details which cannot affect the credibility of Walderita’s and Gertrudes’
testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our ruling in the case of <u>People</u>
<u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Tomas</u> <u>Gadiana</u> (G.R. No. 92509, March 13, 1991)
bears reiterating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stated:</p>

<blockquote>“As this Court had remarked in People v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 76742,
August 7, 1990:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The truth need not be narrated with perfect symmetry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several persons remembering the same incident
may vary in their recollections of some of the details but these differences do
not necessarily make liars of them all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What <span style="">is </span>important is that
they agree on essential facts and that their respective versions, corroborate
and substantially coincide with each other to make a consistent and coherent
whole.’” (at pp. 4-5)</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano further presents the
argument that since the complaining witness, Walderita Abrogar, reported to the
police authorities the matter of her husband’s death and identified the
Sabellanos as the culprits only after the lapse of two (2) days and not
immediately when she had the very first opportunity to do so, i.e., at the time
the police conducted an “on-the-spot” investigation on March 9, 1986, then,
there is ground to believe that the credibility of Walderita’s entire testimony
is greatly weakened.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the circumstances in the case at bar, the delay
in relating to the police authorities the attendant facts of the crime for
which the Sabellanos had been charged <span style="">is
</span>consistent with normal behavior considering that after a tragic
incident, the last thing that the bereaved would want to happen is to provoke
further reprisals from the perpetrators of the felonious act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is a natural tendency to seek
the ends of justice for the treacherous killing of a dearly departed, mourning
and rites for the dead take priority as dictated by our culture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have held in the case of <u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> <u>v.</u></span><span style=""> </span><u>John</u>
<u><span style="">Gabriel</span></u><span style=""> <u>Gamboa</u> (G.R. </span>No. 91374,
February 25, 1991):</p>

<blockquote>“It is quite understandable when the witnesses do not immediately
report the identity of the offender after a startling occurrence more
especially when they are related to the victim as they just had a traumatic
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x Nevertheless, a delay
of about <span style="">a </span>few hours before the
identification of the offender by the prosecution witnesses does not thereby
affect their credibility.” (at p. 9)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the case of <u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> <u>v.</u> </span><u>Ponciano</u> <u>Mandapat</u>,
(G.R. <span style="">No. </span>76953, April 22,
1991), we distinctly stated that:</p>

<blockquote>“As a general rule, the failure of a witness to report at once to
the police authorities the crime he had witnessed cannot be taken against him
(People v. Demate, 113 SCRA 353 [1982]) for ‘it is not uncommon for a witness
to a crime to show <span style="">some </span>reluctance
about getting involved in a criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The natural reticence of most people to get involved in <span style="">a </span>criminal case is of judicial notice’
(People v. Pacabes, 137 SCRA 158 [1985]; People v. Coronado, 145 SCRA 250
[1986]) and the fear of eyewitness when townmates are involved in the
commission of the crime is understandable for they may provoke reprisals from
the accused (People v. Rosario, 134 SCRA 496 [1985]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay, when adequately explained, does
not impair the credibility of the witness, as in the case at bar (People v.
Cabanit, 139 SCRA 94 [1985]); People v. Millora, 119 SCRA 417 [1984]); neither
will it render his testimony biased (People v. Itura, 129 SCRA 127 [1984]); nor
will it destroy its probative value (People v. Millora, <u>supra</u>) x x x”
(at pp. 5-6)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano tries to buttress
his claim that he is innocent of the crime imputed <span style="">to </span>him by adducing evidence in support of the defense of
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he testified that at the
time of the incident in question, he was asleep in his house and was awakened
only by Walderita shouting about her being held-up together with her husband
(TSN, March 13, 1990, pp. 9-12).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Corroborative evidence on the defense of alibi was also given by Erlinda
Sabellano, accused-appellant Wesly’s mother, who stated in her testimony that
on March 6, 1986, between 3:00 o’clock and 4:00 o’clock in the morning, she was
preparing food for her children which included accused-appellant Wesly who were
all asleep at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, January
24, 1990, pp. 6-8)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the trial court’s rejection of the defense of alibi in
line with the doctrinal rule that the defense of alibi being inherently weak
cannot prevail against the prosecution’s positive identification of the accused
and in the absence of any convincing evidence showing physical impossibility of
the accused’s being at the time and place of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. Roberto Soriano y Bruan alias
“Ruben”, et al., G.R. No. 74783, April 22, 1991, citing People v. Garcellano,
23 SCRA 595 [1968]; People v. Naba-unag, 79 SCRA 32 [1977]; see also People v.
Magno Gupo y Gayeta, et <span style="">al., </span>G.R.
No. 75814, September 24, 1990 citing People v. Reunir, 157 SCRA 686 [1988]) As
the trial court stated:</p>

<blockquote>“Also, as clearly shown in Exhibit “3” for the defense, the house
of accused Wesly is not far enough from the scene of the crime for him to have
been physically impossible to have participated in the crime and be at his
house shortly thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Established is
the rule that the accused must be able to show that he was at another place at
the time the crime was committed and that it was physically impossible for him
to be at the scene of the crime at the particular moment it was perpetrated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Lastly, Mrs. Abrogar and Gertrudes Baselides gave such a vivid
account of the attack, clearly identifying the attackers and the clothes worn
that the defense of alibi must necessarily fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi is not credible where the prosecution
witnesses directly testify as to how the assault was committed and positively
identified the accused as the offenders.” (Rollo, pp. 33-34)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the trial court correctly ruled that alibi becomes less
plausible as a defense when it is mainly established by the accused himself and
his immediate relatives who would naturally be expected to make statements in
his favor, <span style="">as </span>in this case it
was the mother of accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano who supported the accused’s
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Dennis de Guzman y de

<p class="BODY">We find <span style="">no </span>cogent
reason to overturn the trial court’s finding that conspiracy exists among the
assailants of the deceased Benito Abrogar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, although the records do not show any direct proof
showing that the accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano together with his three
other companions agreed to inflict fatal wounds on the person of the deceased,
there is overwhelming evidence from the elaborate testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses that Benito’s <span style="">attac</span>k<span style="">ers were at the time and place </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the stabbing incident that led to the death of the said victim, Benito
Abrogar, and that all of them acted in consonance with a common design so that
the quilt of one becomes the guilt of all.<span style="">&nbsp;

163 SCRA 496; People v. Salvador, 163 SCRA 574) Conspiracy need not be proved
by direct evidence but can be inferred from the acts of the accused tending to
show community of criminal purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After a careful review of
the instant case, we find that the accused-appellant Wesly Sabellano is guilty
of the crime of murder qualified by treachery considering </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">he and his other companions adopted a mode of attack that insured the
killing of the deceased Benito Abrogar without risk to themselves inasmuch as</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">their
attack was swiftly and methodically done as observed by the trial court and
