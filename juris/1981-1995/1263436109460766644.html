				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Accused David Posadas, Sr., Danilo Posadas, Marcial Posadas and
Franklin Buenavista were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
murder in a decision rendered in Criminal Case No. <span style="">18269, </span>dated 27 March 1991.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a> The said four
(4) accused were, however, acquitted of the charge of violation of Presidential
Decree 1866 (Illegal Possession of Firearms).  The case against their co-accused, Rodolfo Morales, was dismissed due to
his death on 18 July 1988 while the three (3) other co-accused, David Posadas,
Jr., Alfredo Magno and Anastacio Bartulina alias Anastcio Batilano, remain at-
large.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 December 1992, accused David Posadas, Sr., Marcial Posadas
and Danilo Posadas filed an "Urgent Motion to Withdraw Appeal"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which was granted by this Court on 5 July 1993, after requiring and receiving
the comment of the Office of the Solicitor General interposing no objection to
said withdrawal of appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court therefore will review this case only to determine
whether or not the prosecution has proved the guilt of accused-appellant
Franklin Buenavista with moral certainty as to overcome the constitutional
presumption of his innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts established by the accused, turned state witness,
Conrado Gatilago are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 August 1984, David Posadas, Sr. went to visit Rodolfo
Morales alias "Rudy" at the latter's house in Alta Tierra Village,
Jaro, Iloilo City.  Gatilago who was the
caretaker of Morales' poultry farm testified that on that day David Posadas,
Sr. was trying to convince Rodolfo Morales to kill a certain Arthur Maravilla.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of 13 August 1984, David Posadas, Sr. met with
David Posadas, Jr., Marcial Posadas, Danilo Posadas, Alfredo Magno, Anastacio
Bartulina, Rodolfo Morales and Conrado Gatilago.  It was then that the group agreed to kill Maravilla.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">David Posadas, Sr. later distributed various firearms to the
group and he also ordered David Posadas, Jr. to proceed to Tambalisa Island,
Concepcion, Iloilo to verify if Maravilla was still residing there.  When David, Jr. returned with news that
Maravilla was at his house, the group proceeded to Tambalisa Island where they
spent the night at Alfredo Magno's house.  The next day they each <span style="">test-fired
their firearms in preparation for their diabolical plan to eliminate
Maravilla.  Later that day, the group
proceeded to the house of accused-appellant, Franklin Buenavista, which was
near Maravilla's house to inquire if </span>the latter was at home.  Buenavista answered in the <span style="">affirmative.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The group left immediately and
appellant Buenavista was left behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The group then met Eliseo Santos, Maravilla's caretaker whom they
proceeded to maul and manhandle and later tied to a tree.  The group later returned to Buenavista's
house and David, Sr. ordered Buenavista to call Sixto, Eliseo Santos' son and
Maravilla's helper to tell him that his father was tied to a tree.  Gatilago testified that the purpose of
calling Sixto Santos was to make sure Maravilla would be left alone inside his
house.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>  Appellant Buenavista did as he was ordered
and Sixto Santos and another unidentified man<span style=""> came out after which David, Jr. and Morales fired at the two
(2) men forcing them to flee.  It was at
this point that Maravilla came out of his house.  David, Jr. then shot Maravilla hitting him on both thighs causing
him to fall </span>down.  Morales and
Bartulina likewise shot Maravilla while David, Jr. later hacked the victim with
a bolo.  Maravilla died on the spot of
thirty-six (36) gunshot wounds and several hack wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Franklin Buenavista assigns a single error to
the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x IN CONVICTING <span style="">THE ACCUSED </span>FRANKLIN BUENAVISTA OF THE
CRIME OF MURDER ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE FACTS DO NOT WARRANT SUCH CONVICTION
AND THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED WAS NOT PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court convicted accused-appellant Franklin Buenavista
based on the finding that "the defense of alibi is worthless in the face
of positive identification by credible prosecution witnesses.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that alibi is a weak defense which can be
appreciated only when it is clearly established that it was impossible for the
accused to be at the scene of the crime at the time when it was committed, the
Court also is aware that an alibi, albeit genuine, cannot in all cases be
adequately proven.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the <u>Albores</u> case, this Court had occasion to quote Mr. Justice J.B.
L. Reyes in the case of <u>People v. Fraga</u><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> that:</p>

<blockquote>"The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was never
intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases; otherwise, we will
see the absurdity of an accused being put in <span style="">a </span>more difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is
vague and weak than where it is strong."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, the constitutional presumption of
Buenavista's innocence dictates that the prosecution's evidence be examined
independently of accused-appellant's alibi.  Indeed, the testimony of state witness Conrado Gatilago may have
established the presence of Buenavista at the scene of the crime at the time it
was committed but the question is:  did
the evidence clearly establish Buenavista's participation in the killing of
Maravilla?</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General in a "Manifestation and Motion in <span style="">Lieu </span>of Brief" prays for the
acquittal of accused-appellant Franklin Buenavista based on two (2) grounds,
namely:  (1) there is no evidence to
prove appellant's participation in the murder of Arthur Maravilla and (2)
appellant was coerced to call for Sixto Santos to come out.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General and consequently we reverse
the trial court's conviction of accused-appellant Franklin Buenavista.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the testimony of Conrado Gatilago
established that Franklin Buenavista merely verified that the victim, Arthur
Maravilla was at home.  The reply of
Buenavista was a response to the inquiry posed by David, Sr. and his group.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Nowhere in Gatilago's testimony was it shown that Buenavista was an active <span style="">or</span> willing participant in the plan to
liquidate Maravilla.  His alleged
participation in luring Sixto Santos out of the house is belied by Gatilago's
own testimony, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was there any
conversation that transpired further between your group and Franquilino
(Franklin) Buenavista?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>David Posadas, Jr. <u>ordered</u>
that the son of the old man who was Sixto be called.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Called for what
purpose?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To inform Sixto that
his father, the old man, was already tied on (sic) a tree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For what purpose was
the information to be given?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So that Sixto will
come out of the house of Arthur Maravilla so that Arthur Maravilla will be left
alone and it will be easy to kill him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is this Sixto that you
mentioned is the son of (sic) the old man staying inside the house of Arthur
Maravilla?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So what did
Franquilino Buenavista do when he was <u>instructed</u> to execute their
instruction?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Franquilino Buenavista
obey (sic) the <u>order</u> and called Sixto that his father was already tied
up there on the tree."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The guilt of Franklin Buenavista cannot be based on mere
conjectures that he became part of the conspiracy by verify­ing that the victim
was at home and obeying the order of David, Jr. to call Sixto.  The Court takes note of the fact that the
group of David, Jr. was composed of no less than eight (8) fully-armed men and
it would not take much logic or experience to infer that Buenavista acted out
of a natural sense of self-preservation when he followed the <u>orders</u> of
David, Jr.  The doubt as to guilt must
be resolved in favor of the constitutional presumption of his innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED,
as to appellant Franklin Buenavista, based on reasonable doubt.  The accused-appellant Franklin Buenavista is
hereby ACQUITTED and ordered immediately released unless he is being detained
for other legal grounds.</p>
