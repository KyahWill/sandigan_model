Metro Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 54117 for "<span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>

by the Metropolitan Trial Court against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1987</st1:date>,
pursuant to the writ of execution issued in Civil Case No. 6046 for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, complainant and <span class="SpellE">Peregrina</span>
were served a notice to vacate the rented premises within four (4) days from
receipt of notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Desperate and at a loss on what to do, they consulted a certain
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Pagalunan</span> on the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pagalunan</span>, in turn,
introduced them to herein respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After such introduction, the parties "impliedly agreed" that
respondent would handle their case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, a petition entitled "Annulment of Judgment, Annulment of
Sale and Damages with prayer for Preliminary Injunction and/or Status Quo
Order, etc." was prepared by respondent to forestall the execution of the
order to vacate in Civil Case No. 6046.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="10">October
 9, 1987</st1:date>, the complainant was made to sign by respondent what she
described as a "[h]<span class="SpellE">astily</span> prepared, poorly
conceived, and haphazardly composed"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
petition for annulment of judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant alleges that respondent promised her that the necessary
restraining order would be secured if only because the judge who would hear the
matter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>his
"<span class="SpellE">katsukaran</span>" (close friend).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Thereupon, the petition
was filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 153, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Pasig</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, Metro Manila and docketed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as Civil Case No. 55118.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent demanded from the complainant one
thousand pesos (P1,000.00) as attorney's fee which the latter paid that same
afternoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">However, when the case
was raffled and assigned to Branch 153, the presiding judge asked respondent to
withdraw as counsel in the case on the ground of their friendship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On October 11, 1987,
respondent went to the house of complainant and asked her to be ready with two
thousand pesos (P2,000.00) to be given to another judge who will issue the
restraining order in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case (Civil Case
No. 6046).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant and her sister
were only able to raise the amount of one thousand pesos which they immediately
gave to respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Later respondent informed
the complainant and her sister that he could not locate the judge who would
issue the restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
parties, then, instead went to the Max's Restaurant where respondent ordered
some food - including two plastic bags of food allegedly to be given to the
judge who would issue the restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At this juncture, respondent asked for the remaining balance of the two
thousand pesos (P2,000.00) which he earlier demanded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant gave her last money - a ten
dollar ($10.00) bill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sometime after the filing
of Civil Case No. 55118, respondent informed complainant and <span class="SpellE">Peregrina</span> that there was </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">need to file another case with the Regional Trial Court to enable them
to regain possession of the apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For this</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:27.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">purpose, respondent told
complainant to prepare the amount of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) allegedly
to be deposited with the Treasurer's Office </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pasig</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> as purchase price of the apartment and
another one thousand pesos (P1,000.00) to cover the expenses of the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent stressed to the complainant the
need and urgency of filing the new complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant and <span class="SpellE">Peregrina</span> raised the
said amounts through the kindness of some friends and relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10">October
 26, 1987</st1:date>, the money was handed over to the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, a complaint for "Specific Performance,
Annulment of Simulated or Spurious Sale with Damages," later docketed as
Civil Case No. 55210, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span>filed by respondent with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 165,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the
preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. 55118 on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1987</st1:date>, respondent, contrary to his promise
that he would secure a restraining order, withdrew his appearance as counsel
for complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Complainant </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not able to get
another lawyer as replacement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, no
restraining order or preliminary injunction was obtained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the order to vacate in
Civil Case No. 6046 was eventually enforced and executed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime thereafter, it came to complainant's knowledge that
there was really no need to make a deposit of ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00)
relative to Civil Case No. 55210.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
further inquiry, she found out that in fact there was no such deposit
made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1987</st1:date>, complainant sent a demand
letter to respondent asking for the return of the total amount of eleven
thousand pesos (P11,000.00) which the former earlier gave to the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this letter was never answered and
the money was never returned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
complainant lodged this administrative complaint against herein respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1987</st1:date>, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 153, dismissed Civil
Case No. 55118 for failure to state <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>cause
of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

On <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1988</st1:date>, Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Case </span>No.
55210 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>likewise
dismissed for being identical with Civil Case No. 55118.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Respondent in his answer contends that the filing of Civil Cases
Nos. 55118 and 55210 was done in good faith and that the allegations of
complainant relative to the administrative charge against him are all lies,
product of one's imagination and only intended to <span class="SpellE">harrass</span>
him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court agrees that the petitions in Civil Cases Nos. 55118
and 55210 appear to be poorly prepared and written.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having represented himself capable of picking
up the cudgels for the apparently lost cause of complainant respondent should
have carefully prepared the pleadings if only to establish the justness of his
representation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The little time involved
is no excuse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant reposed full
faith in him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His first duty was to file
the best <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pleading within his
capability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, respondent was
more interested in getting the most out of the complainant who was in a
hopeless situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He bragged about his
closeness to the judge concerned in one case and talked about the need to
"buy" the restraining order in the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Worse still he got P10,000.00 as alleged
deposit in court which he never deposited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead he pocketed the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pattern to milk the complainant dry is obvious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">When a lawyer takes a
client's cause, he thereby covenants that he will exert all effort for its
prosecution until its final conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The failure to exercise due diligence or the abandonment of a client's
cause makes such lawyer unworthy of the trust which the client had reposed </span>on
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The acts of respondent in this case violate the most elementary
principles of professional ethics.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The Court finds that
respondent failed to exercise due diligence in protecting his client's
interests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent had knowledge
beforehand that he would be asked by the presiding judge in Civil Case No.
55118 to withdraw his appearance as counsel by reason of their friendship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite such prior knowledge, respondent took
no steps to find a replacement nor did he inform complainant of this fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Even assuming that
respondent had no previous knowledge that he would be asked to withdraw, the
record is quite clear that four (4) days prior to the hearing of the
preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. 55118 respondent already filed a
motion therein withdrawing as complainant's counsel interposing as reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> his frequent attacks of pain due to
hemorrhoids.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite this void,
respondent failed to find a replacement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He did not even ask complainant to hire another lawyer </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his stead.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">His actuation is
definitely inconsistent with his duty to protect with utmost dedication the
interest of his client and of the fidelity, trust and confidence which he owes
his client.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

gross negligence complainant thereby suffered by losing all her cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The filing of Civil Case
No. 55210 on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">October 26, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, the same day that he had already filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">motion to withdraw as counsel for complainant
in Civil Case No. 55118, reveals his lack of good faith as an advocate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also failed to appear for the complainant
in said case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was all </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a show to get more money from her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This adversely reflects on his fitness to
practice law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When confronted with this
evident irregularity, he lamely stated that while he did not physically appear
for complainant he nevertheless prepared and drafted the pleadings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">His services were engaged
by complainant hoping that the property subject of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceeding would be returned to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, it was respondent who persuaded complainant that the filing of these two
cases simultaneously were the means by which this objective can be achieved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His duty was not only to prepare the
pleadings but to represent complainant until the termination of the cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This he failed to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">His representation that there was an immediate need to file Civil
Case No. 55210 when he already knew that he could no longer physically handle
the same is an act of deception of his client.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It shows lack of fidelity to his oath of office as a member of the Philippine
bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of respondent that the ten thousand pesos
(P10,000.00) was given to him as fee for his services, is simply
incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, such amount is
grossly disproportionate with the service he actually rendered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
And his failure to return even a portion of the amount upon demand of
complainant all the more bolsters the protestation of complainant that
respondent does not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">deserve </span>to
remain as an officer of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lawyers are an indispensable part of the whole system of
administering justice in this jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At a time when strong and disturbing criticisms are being hurled at the
legal profession, strict compliance with one's oath of office and the canons of
professional ethics is an imperative.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Lawyers should be fair,
honest, respectable, above suspicion and beyond reproach in dealing with their
clients.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The profession is not
synonymous with an ordinary business proposition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a matter of public interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, after considering the entirety of the
circumstances present in this case, this Court finds Atty. <span class="SpellE">Humberto</span>
