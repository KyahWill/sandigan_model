<p class="BODY">This is an appeal from <span>the order of the then </span>Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> in Civil Case No. 6200-M<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> for partition and delivery <span>of 
possession of certain shares in the conjugal assets.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion </span><span>of the order which herein 
petitioners assail states:<o:p></o:p></span> </p>
<blockquote>"Upon due research and study, the Court finds sustainable the 
position of the defendants that the settled prevailing rule at present as laid 
down in latest decisions of the Supreme Court is that the right or action to 
enforce an implied or constructive trust (which is the situation indicated in 
the case at bar) in one's favor prescribes in ten <span>(10) 
</span>years.<span>&nbsp; </span>The citation of authorities made by defendants 
appears to be correct.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Carontes</em></span><em> vs. 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>C.A</st1:place></st1:country-region></em><st1:country-region><st1:place>.</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
76 SCRA 514; <span class="SpellE"><em>Dela</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Cerna</em></span><em> vs. Dela</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Cerna</em></span>, 72 SCRA 514).<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words, 
the rule of <span class="SpellE">imprescriptibility</span> of actions based on 
constructive trust invoked by plaintiffs has been reversed and 
abandoned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the foregoing premises, this case has to be resolved for 
defendants - <span class="SpellE">movants</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Case is 
accordingly dismissed.<span>&nbsp; </span>No costs."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The records show that spouses <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Roberta <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> owned, as conjugal property, during their lifetime 29 
parcels of unregistered land with improvements thereon, all situated in <span class="SpellE">Dampol</span> 1st, <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="2" day="18" year="1903">February 18, 1903</st1:date>, Roberta <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> died intestate and without debts in <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, where she was a 
resident before and at the time of her death.<span>&nbsp; </span>She left her 
husband, <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, 
and their two legitimate children, Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> <span>as her only forced heirs.<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
September 18, 1952, <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> died also intestate and without debts in <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, leaving as his 
only compulsory heirs the children of <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> (who 
together with her sister Mercedes, had predeceased their father) who are now 
petitioners herein and his legitimate children with his second wife, <span class="SpellE">Atanacia</span> Agustin, who are the private respondents 
herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The records also disclose that on <st1:date month="6" day="19" year="1981">June 19, 1981</st1:date>, or 28 years, 9 months and 1 day after 
<span class="SpellE">Ubano's</span> death, petitioners instituted an action with 
the then CFI of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> for partition and delivery of 
possession of their corresponding shares in the conjugal estate of 
decedents-spouses <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> and Roberta consisting of 
subject 29 parcels of unregistered land.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners filed the 
case because since the death of <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>, their 
grandfather, in 1952, private respondents (his children by the second marriage) 
had taken possession of the whole conjugal property and appropriated to 
themselves to the exclusion of petitioners the products coming from the 29 
parcels of land.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="30" year="1981">September 30, 
1981</st1:date> or around three (3) months from the filing of the civil case, 
respondent judge issued the questioned order.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' motion 
for reconsideration of the same was denied on <st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1982">January 12, 1982</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition which petitioners filed on <st1:date month="4" day="5" year="1982">April 5, 1982</st1:date> praying for the 
revocation of the questioned order and the reinstatement of this case in the 
trial court.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners anchor their petition on the following grounds:</p>
<ol><li>The subject parcels of land being unregistered lands do not come within the 
applicability of the decisions invoked which involve registered 
lands;<br><br></li><li>Assuming that the ten-year prescriptive period applies even in cases of 
unregistered lands, the prescriptive period did not commence to run against 
petitioners since there is no allegation, much less <span>evidence, that private 
respondents had openly and effectively repudiated the co-ownership or 
constructive trust over the subject property;<o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li><span></span>There can be no constructive notice of an adverse claim of 
ownership in favor of private respondents <span>by placing the subject lands in 
their names in the office of the Provincial Assessor; and</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>Petitioners' action for partition is still timely despite the lapse of 
almost 29 years during which private respondents had been in possession of the 
property.<span><o:p><br></o:p></span></li></ol>
<p class="BODY">Private respondents, on the other hand, contend that the order 
appealed from has already become final and no longer <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>; and, that the petition is not meritorious 
because of the following:</p>
<ol><li>The theory of constructive trust was brought out by petitioners 
themselves;<br><br></li><li>Petitioners cannot contradict their own admissions in the 
pleadings;<br><br></li><li><span>&nbsp;</span>Petitioners slept on their alleged rights; and<br><br></li><li>Contrary to petitioners' claim, the jurisprudence cited by private 
respondents apply to unregistered lands.<br></li></ol>
<p class="BODY">The resolution of this case hinges on the focal issue of 
prescription.</p>
<p class="BODY"><em>We</em> find the order of the trial court dismissing 
petitioners' complaint on the ground of prescription under Section 40 of Public 
Act No. 190 to be inaccurate.</p>
<p class="BODY">As We see it this case is governed by the rules on co-ownership, 
since both parties are clearly co-owners of the disputed properties, having 
inherited the same from a common ancestor.</p>
<p class="BODY">Now then, Art. 494 (last paragraph) of the Civil <span>Code 
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>
<table align="center" border="0" width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></td>
<td>
<div align="center">xxx</div></td>
<td>
<div align="right">xxx"</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<blockquote>"No prescription shall run in favor of a co-owner or co-heir against 
his co-owners or co-heirs so long as he expressly or <span>impliedly recognizes 
the co-ownership."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">In view of their lack of a clear 
repudiation of the co-ownership, duly communicated to the petitioners (the other 
co-owners), private respondents cannot acquire the shares of the petitioners by 
prescription.<span>&nbsp; </span>The record in the <span>Office of the Assessor is 
not the sufficient repudiation and communication contemplated by the law.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Neither may the private respondents' possession of the premises militate 
against petitioners' claim.<span>&nbsp; </span>After all, co-owners are entitled to 
be in possession of the premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The existence of the co-ownership here argues against the theory 
of implied trust, for then a co-owner possesses co-owned property not in behalf 
of the other co-owners but in his own behalf.</p>
<p class="BODY">Anent the contention that the judgment of the trial court has 
already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the records reveal 
the contrary.<span>&nbsp; </span>The appeal was filed on time on <st1:date month="4" day="5" year="1982">April 5, 1982</st1:date> or before <st1:date month="4" day="28" year="1982">April 28, 1982</st1:date>, the last day granted by this 
Court for the filing of the appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <span>the assailed Order is </span>SET ASIDE, 
and a new one is rendered remanding this case to the lower court for 
adjudication on the merits.</p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, (Chairman), 
Gutierrez, Jr., Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Bidin</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Cortes, JJ., <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span> 
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>, J.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> on leave.</span></p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></span><br><br><br>
