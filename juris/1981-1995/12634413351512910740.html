<p class="BODY">According to petitioners, on July 30, 1992 they moved to quash the
informations in Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483 to C-40489 on the ground of
duplicity of offenses charged <span style="">therein.  The same was dismissed by the trial court </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">its order of December 10, 1992 which is hereunder reproduced:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Acting on the "Motion to Quash” and the "Opposition"
thereto, and considering, as urged, that each Information filed against the
accused in Crim. Cases Nos. 40482, 40483, 40484, 40485, 40486, 40487, 40488 and
40489 indubitably show different private complainants involving different
transactions committed on different dates, which assertion is further
reinforced by the averment in the affidavit-complaints executed by the
complainants in each (of the) aforesaid criminal cases, the movant's contention
therefore that the ground alleged in the Motion to Quash is within the
provision of Sec. 3, Rule 117, is untenable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The applicable rule on the question of duplicitous Information is
Sec. 2(e), Rule 117, not Sec. 3 of Rule 117 as urged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As correctly pointed out by the public prosecutor, the duplicitous
Information presupposes one or more offenses contained in one or (a) single
Information under Sec. 2(e), Rule 117, Rules of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But read as it should be, each Information here clearly alleges
only one offense for one single act, consequently, the Rule in question does
not apply.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accordingly, the Motion to Quash is hereby DENIED.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unfazed, and obviously for the same purpose since they raised
exactly the same contentions, petitioners sought the extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition from the Court of Appeals to set aside the aforesaid denial
order of the trial court.  In its
decision<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
in CA-G.R. SP No. 31021 promulgated on June 22, 1993, said appellate court made
<span style="">short shrift of the pretensions of
petitioners in these terse observations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Petitioners allege that the informations are duplicitous and the
trial court should have quashed them.  They contend that the complainants in Criminal Case No. 40482 and the
individual complainants in the seven other cases (Criminal Case No.
40483-40489) are one and the same and that the acts alleged in the first case
(No. 40482) to have been committed during the period July, 1990 to December,
1991 are the same acts charged individually in the other seven cases (Nos.
40483-40489) on dates covered by the same period alleged in the first
case.  Petitioners argue that in
refusing to quash the informations, the trial court committed a grave abuse of
discretion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These contentions are without merit.  To be sure, an information is considered duplicitous and
therefore subject to dismissal if it charges more than one offense except in
cases in which a single punishment is prescribed for various offenses.  (Rule 117, Sec. 3(e]).  In the case at bar, each information charges
only one offense of estafa and, therefore, there is no basis for moving to
quash on the ground of duplicity of offense.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, in an apparent gesture of understanding
accommodation and by way of guidance to petitioners on the error of their ways
even on such elementary procedural matters, respondent court deigned to proceed
further and extended this solicitous explanation to them:</p>

<blockquote>What probably petitioners want to say is that for the same act
alleged to constitute the crime of estafa they are being held liable to two
complainants.  For the theory of the
prosecution appears to be that during the period July 1990 to December 1991,
petitioners, as agents of the respondent Hometrust Development Corp. defrauded
and deceived both Hometrust Development and the lot buyers by representing to
the latter that they (petitioners) were authorized to receive payments when in
fact they were not, and were thus able to collect from the lot owners the total
amount of P353,000.00 which they subsequently misappropriated and converted to
their personal use and benefit.  For
this reason eight informations were filed against petitioners from which it is
clear that the cases involve different parties and amounts and that the acts
alleged to constitute estafa were committed on different dates, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus for every single act of misappropriation both those from whom
the amounts were received and the Hometrust Development to which the payments
were intended have brought estafa cases against the herein petitioners in (the)
latter's capacity as president, finance manager and sales director respectively
of the Apple Realty and Development Corp., sales agent (without authority to
receive payments) of Hometrust Development Corp.  It <span style="">is<i> </i></span>clear
that each information charges only one offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That was all, that was enough, and that was correct.  In fine, respondent Court of Appeals
frontally and succinctly confronted the sole issue of the alleged
multifariousness of the informations which was the same and <span style="">only ground invoked by petitioners in both
the trial court and the respondent court.  It did not digress into the arcanum of the application to said criminal
cases of the rule on a </span><i>delito continuado </i><span style="">or the inapplicability of a supposed non-existent rule of </span><i>litis
</i><i><span style="">pendentia </span></i><span style="">as applied to double jeopardy, as was done
during the deliberations </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this case.  Rationally, it did not have to and, legally, it could not do </span>so.</p>

<p class="BODY">For, in no uncertain terms, Section <span style="">2, </span>Rule 117 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, as
intentionally amended for that purpose, mandatorily provides that "(t)he
motion to quash shall be in writing signed by the accused or his counsel.  It shall <i>specify distinctly the factual
and legal grounds </i>therefor and the court <i>shall consider no grounds other
than those stated therein, </i><span style="">except
lack of jurisdiction over the offense charged" (Stress supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All the way from the lower court, through the respondent court,
and now before this Court, petitioners have at least been consistent in
obdurately cleaving and limiting their plaint to the lone issue of supposed
duplicitous informations.  We cannot,
therefore, conceive of how the foregoing pithy dispositions of the two courts
before us could have failed to put that matter to rest.  We also cannot understand why, despite the
aforecited prohibition in Rule 117, this Court should still be expected to
consider other grounds intrusive upon the merits of the criminal cases involved
which would disturb the correct pronouncements of the two lower courts, instead
of summarily denying this petition.  However, if only to dissipate intransigent reservations on our decision
on this incident, and to serve as bearings to the court <i>a quo </i>with
regard to our ultimate resolution thereof, we shall tread on the virtual merits
of the estafa cases in question <i><span style="">as
the facts thereof appear from the pleadings of record.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Indulging all inferences in favor of petitioners, what appears to
be the implication in their otherwise defective submissions is that despite the
number of aggrieved parties, they committed only one offense of estafa, and
solely against respondent corporation which is now the subject of Criminal Case
No. C-40482.  They would postulate that
into said case should be deemed integrated the separate offenses complained of
by the seven individual lot buyers, instead of the latter being made the
respective subjects of Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483 to C-40489.</p>

<p class="BODY">What would seem to be the reason for that theory is that the
essential allegations of facts and the specifications of the offenses charged
in the informations in Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483 to C-40489 are supposedly
the same as those stated in the information in Criminal Case No. C-40482, hence
respondent corporation is the offended party in all the eight
informations.  They would rebuke
respondent Court of Appeals for holding that the seven complainants in the
seven other informations are different from the complainant corporation in
Criminal Case No. C-40482.  Their thesis
would be that since the informations also state that petitioners had defrauded respondent
corporation, the allegations in the informations in Criminal Cases <span style="">Nos. </span>C-40483 to C-40489 that the acts
of petitioners caused damage and prejudice to the individual complainants
mentioned therein should be treated as superfluities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the function of the extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i>,
as it is here invoked, would be to annul and set aside <span style="">a </span>purported grave abuse of discretion by the prosecutor in
filing several informations involving, according to petitioners' theory, one
and the same offense.  This argument,
however, would completely ignore the fact that the ground of double jeopardy <span style="">was </span>never raised in a motion to quash,
hence that ground cannot be made the basis for attributing grave abuse of
discretion to the prosecutor.  It is
also inconsistent with the reasoning advanced during our deliberations that
these cases would fall within the purview of the constitutional right against
double jeopardy were it not for the failure of existing rules on criminal
procedure to address the instant situation.  <span style="">If </span><i>ex hypothesi </i>there
is no rule on double jeopardy to govern such situation and, for that matter, it
has not even been invoked in the motion to quash, it is then unpardonably
absurd to claim that its non-application by the prosecutor could constitute
grave abuse of discretion on his part.</p>

<p class="BODY">The core issue is, therefore, whether the offenses separately
charged in the eight informations actually constitute only one offense or were
correctly considered as eight separate crimes of estafa.  No hearing on this issue <span style="">was </span>ever conducted in the court below
as it was never raised therein; and the sole ground of multifariousness was,
since it could properly be, resolved by the court only on the bases of the
allegations in the motion to quash without introduction of evidence <i>aliunde.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of double jeopardy should properly have been raised in
and resolved by the trial court in the first instance as it would necessitate
evidence on the terms of the contracts or documentation of the transactions
with the lot buyers, the rights and obligations of the parties thereunder, the
binding effects thereof, the resolutory conditions or grounds for rescission,
any confirmation or repudiation thereof as may have been made by respondent
corporation, and the like.  In any event,
the present petition could also have been rejected outright, without thereby
causing any undue prejudice to the parties, even merely on the bases of the
present contents and state of the records before us.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime of estafa
committed against respondent corporation, on the one hand, and those committed
against the lot buyers, on the other, are definitely separate felonies.  They were dictated by <i><span style="">different criminal intents, </span></i>committed
under <i>different modes of commission</i> provided by the law on estafa,
perpetrated by <i>different acts,</i> consummated on <i>different occasions,</i>
and caused injury to <i>different parties.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">The crime of estafa against respondent corporation <span style="">was committed </span>through unfaithfulness
or abuse of confidence, specifically as provided in Paragraph 1(b) of Article
315, Revised Penal Code.  The operative
act in the perpetration thereof was the failure to turn over or deliver to
respondent corporation the amounts collected by the accused, despite their duty
to do <span style="">so.  </span>The felony was consummated on the dates when and at the
places where such amounts were to be delivered to respondent corporation under
the agency agreement therefor or within a reasonable time from receipt of the
payments made by the lot buyers.  The
aggrieved party was respondent corporation which suffered damages basically to
the extent of the sums collected in its behalf but not delivered or accounted <span style="">for </span>by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the lot buyers, the offense of swindling was
committed by deceit or false pretenses employed prior to or simultaneously with
the commission of the fraud, more specifically as provided in Paragraph 2(a) of
the same article of the Code, that is, by the accused falsely pretending to
possess the power to collect the payments due from said buyers, despite the
peculiar but specific prohibition imposed by their said principal.  The felony was perpetrated through the
aforesaid the deceitful misrepresentations which made possible the unauthorized
collections.  The offense was
consummated upon receipt by the accused of the amounts in the different
occasions and places where the payments were made by the lot buyers.  The aggrieved parties were the lot buyers
who individually and separately suffered damages by being deprived not only of
their money but primarily of their property rights to and in the lots they
respectively purchased.</p>

<p class="BODY">In either instance, the requisite ingredients of estafa as
separate offenses are present, that is, for respondent corporation the elements
of abuse of confidence and damage, and for the lot buyers the elements of
deceit and damage.  It has been held
that estafa can be committed with the attendance of both modes of commission,
that is, abuse of confidence and deceit employed against the same victim and
causing damage to him.  Thus, where an
agent deliberately misrepresented to the landowner, the real position of the
prospective buyer of the land in order to induce said owner to agree to a lower
price and, thereafter, the agent sold <span style="">the
land for the higher amount which was actually agreed upon by him and the buyer,
and he then clandestinely misappropriated the excess, the crime of estafa was
committed under both modes and he could be charged under either.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Withal, it </span>has <span style="">also been held that such estafa is more
properly categorized as one committed through abuse of confidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With much more reason, therefore, should the offense of estafa
against respondent corporation be considered discretely and separately from
those committed against the lot buyers since, <i>inter alia, </i>different
modes of commission and different parties are concerned.  Furthermore, to underscore the distinction
between the estafa committed against respondent corporation and the lot buyers,
in estafa through abuse of confidence prior demand should be made by the
offended party on the accused to comply with the obligation before the latter
may be charged criminally,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">but there is no such requirement where the
estafa was committed through deceit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the damage sustained by the lot buyers is distinct
from that suffered by respondent corporation, since, primarily, the injury to
the lot buyers was the deprivation of their rights or the exercise thereof over
the properties they respectively purchased.  It has long been the rule that actual damage is not necessary in estafa,
as long as it is capable of pecuniary estimation, hence mere temporary
disturbance of property rights is equivalent to damage.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Even if the prejudice is temporary, that would suffice for the element of
damage in estafa.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, the lot buyers involved in the criminal cases subject of the present <span style="">recourse have, </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">direct </span><span style="">consequence of the </span>acts of
petitioners, been deprived of the exercise of their rights of actual or
potential ownership over their properties since 1991 up to the <span style="">present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That the names of the seven lot buyers and the amounts they paid
are mentioned in the information in Criminal Case No. C-40482 does not have the
significance claimed by petitioners.  These were only mentioned therein to explain the source of and the
amounts involved, the totality whereof constituted the element of damage to
respondent corporation.  On the other
hand, the statement in Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483 to C-40489 that the accused
"defrauded and deceived" respondent corporation is the phrase which
should be considered as a <span style="">surplusage.  The information </span><span style="">in </span>each of <span style="">the</span> <span style="">latter seven cases
specifically refers to the individual complainant therein, alleges how the </span><span style="">accused "induced and convinced </span><span style="">(the complainant) to buy and purchase lots
and/or houses and lots and receive(d) payments and issue(d) receipts
therefor," which amounts they represented "as the reservation
fee/downpayment" for the properties sold "when </span>in truth and in
fact they were not entitled to do so x x x to the damage and prejudice of the
complainant thereof." Such allegations constitute the estafa contemplated
in Paragraph 2(a) of Article 315, with the respective complainants as the
offended parties separately from respondent corporation.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Consequent to the theory of identity of the offense committed
against respondent corporation vis-a-vis those against the lot buyers, we
reject petitioners' plea for the dismissal of Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483 to
C-40489<span style=""> </span>which were filed each
with one lot buyer as the offended party therein.  While the felonious acts perpetrated against said lot buyers do
not constitute a <i>delito continuado, </i>there must be an explicitation as to
whether, under the taxonomy in the Spanish concept of <i>concurso de delitos, </i>the
seven acts of defraudation under said informations constitute material or real
plurality, hence there are seven crimes of estafa, or should be considered as
in the nature of formal or ideal plurality, hence there is only one crime of
estafa.  We rule that said seven <span style="">cases </span>fall under the category of <i><span style="">concurso real, </span></i>hence there are
seven juridically independent crimes involving said lot buyers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The series of acts committed against the seven lot buyers was not
the product of a single criminal intent.  The misrepresentation or deceit was employed against each lot buyer on
different dates and in separate places, hence they <span style="">originated from separate criminal intents and consequently resulted in
separate felonies.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Furthermore, even assuming </span><i>arguendo
</i><span style="">that the defraudations were
pursuant to an identical design, they were committed over a period of about one
and a half years and at substantial intervals both in time and in distance of
situs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">More conclusive is the fact that, after the commission of one
estafa, the accused could not have had the foreknowledge as to when or whether
they could replicate the same felony against another victim still necessarily
unknown.  This lack of prevision on
their part definitely proves that the criminal intent entailed in a preceding
swindle could not operate as the same criminal intent <i>in futuro </i>as
regards another subsequent estafa.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> The
inescapable conclusion is that, all told, a total of eight crimes of estafa
were actually committed by the accused against different victims.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no
cogency in the proposition that the prosecutor acted with grave abuse of
discretion in filing eight separate charges of estafa, or, for that matter,
that the trial court and respondent court are guilty of the same discretional
error in refusing to quash the eight informations.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, as petitioners seem to apprehend, the adverse actions of two
lower courts could create a scenario of multiple prosecutions for the same
offense or, more candidly expressed, of double jeopardy, then this is neither
the procedural stage nor the proper occasion to pass upon that
possibility.  For, squarely imputable to
petitioners is the evident lack of factual basis for and a grossly defective
presentation of that issue for this Court to rule thereon in this proceeding
and at this time.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, this observation would not foreclose relief to
petitioners if at the trial of this case the evidence presented and the
developments therein suffice to establish the supervenient fact that indeed
there could possibly be a breach of the rule of double jeopardy.  Under Section 8 of Rule 117, they can still
hereafter raise that defense of <i><span style="">non </span></i><i><span style="">bis in </span></i><i><span style="">idem, </span></i>provided that they can lay the evidentiary bases
therefor and refute from the standpoint of substantive penal law what was
earlier said on the nature and the non-­identity of the several crimes of
estafa involved which, to repeat, we pronounced purely on the bases of existing
records <i><span style="">sans </span></i>the benefit
of any evidentiary fact since none has been adduced.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">,<b> </b></span>the impugned decision of
respondent Court of Appeals is <span style="">AFFIRMED </span>and
the instant petition is hereby <span style="">DENIED, </span>with
treble costs against petitioners.  This
judgment is immediately executory and, upon entry thereof in due course, the
record of this case is ordered to be forthwith remanded to the court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>which is hereby <span style="">DIRECTED </span>to take appropriate action
therein with all deliberate and practicable dispatch.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">QUIASON, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with Mr. Justice Florenz Regalado that the informations
in Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483 to C-40489 did not allege the same offense
charged in Criminal Case No. C-40482.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information in Criminal Case No. C-40482 alleged that on or
about the period from July 1990 to December 1991, in Kalookan City:</p>

<blockquote>  (1)  The accused were the President, Finance Manager and Sales Director,
respectively of the Apple Realty and Development Corporation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  (2)  The Apple Realty and Development Corporation was appointed an agent of
the Hometrust Development Corporation to sell houses and lots;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  (3)  The accused defrauded and deceived the
Hometrust Development Corporation in the following manner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>By means of false manifestation and fraudulent representation, that
is, by misrepresenting that they were authorized to collect and receive payments
from buyers of the houses and lots and to issue the receipts therefor, when
they knew fully well that they were <span style="">not
authorized to do so, the accused, acting in conspiracy and confederating with
one another, were able to collect the total amount of P353,500.00 from the
following buyers:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Instead of remitting their collection to the Hometrust Development
Corporation, the accused unlawfully misappropriated and failed to restitute the
said amount to the damage and prejudice of the Hometrust Development
Corporation (Rollo, pp. 18-­19).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The informations in Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483 to C-40489
uniformly alleged that on or about the period from May 1991 up to November
1991:</p>

<blockquote>(1)  The accused were the President, Finance
Manager and Sales Director, respectively, of the Apple Realty and Development
Corporation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  The accused were duly appointed agents of
the Hometrust Development Corporation to sell houses and lots on commission
basis but were expressly prohibited from receiving payments from the buyers or
from issuing receipts of such payments;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)  The accused defrauded and deceived the
Hometrust Development Corporation in the following manner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>By receiving payment from the buyers when they were not authorized
to do so and by misappropriating the money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused failed to restitute the money to the damage and
prejudice of the buyers-complainants (Rollo, pp. 20-33).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While all the informations involve the same transactions and
allege that the accused had defrauded the Hometrust Development Corporation, a
closer study thereof shows that the estafa alleged to have been committed <span style="">in </span>Criminal Case No. C-40482 is not
the same estafa alleged to have been committed in Criminal Cases Nos. C-40483
to C-40489.  The offense charged in
Criminal Case No. C-40482 was the failure of the agents to turn over their
collections to their principal, while the offenses charged in Criminal Cases
Nos. C-40483 to C-40489 were the collections of the purchase price by the
agents from the customers (the individual complainants in said criminal cases)
without informing said buyers that they had no authority to do so.  To this extent, the buyers suffered a
disturbance of their property rights.</p>
