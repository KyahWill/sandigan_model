<blockquote>"Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> filed an application
for the registration and confirmation of title over a parcel of land, with an
area of 280 sq. meters, situated at Barrio Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>San <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zambales</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application ** was docketed in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, Branch III (presided by respondent Judge) as LRC
No. N-187-O.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioner (Republic) opposed the application on the ground that
the ** <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> is a private corporation, and that under Art.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>XIV, sec. 11, of the Constitution, private
corporations cannot acquire lands of the public domain but can <span style="">only hold them by lease in an area not
exceeding 1,000 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>** It appears
that the applicant acquired the property in question from Gregorio Rolls and <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> Rolls (both of San <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>) on </span><st1:date year="1946" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May 23, 1946</span></st1:date><span style="">, as shown by the Deed of Sale (Exhibit
'I').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After acquiring the land,
applicant had it declared for taxation purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>** ** The latest tax declaration of this same
parcel of land starts with the year 1974 as per Tax Dec. No. 4763 **.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land is exempt from payment of Realty Tax,
being devoted primarily for religious purposes (Exhibit N).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Without passing upon the
Government's contention that respondent <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> was disqualified from
acquiring the land in question, the trial court rendered judgment on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="6"><span style="">June 2,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In that case, </span><i>Director
of Lands v. I.A.C.</i>, <span style="">a private
corporation, </span>Acme Plywood &amp; Veneer Co., Inc. purchased a tract of
land in 1962 from Mariano <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> and Acer <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, two members of the <span class="SpellE">Dumagat</span>
tribe, but applied with the Court for registration of its title over the land
under the Torrens Act only in July, 1981, long after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the 1973 Constitution -- which <i><span style="">inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></i><span style="">
</span>prohibits private corporations from holding alienable lands of the
public domain, except by lease not to exceed 1,000 hectares (a prohibition not
found in the 1935 Constitution, in force in 1962 when Acme purchased the land
in question).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no question
that Acme and its predecessors-in-interest had possessed and occupied the land
for more than the required 30-year period prescribed in Section 48 of the
Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended),<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the question presented to the Court <i><span style="">en
banc</span></i><span style=""> </span>was whether or
not the title that Acme had acquired in 1962 could be confirmed in its favor in
proceedings instituted by it in 1981 when the 1973 Constitution was already in
effect, having in mind the prohibition therein against private corporations
holdings lands of the public domain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That question the Court <i><span style="">en
banc</span></i><span style=""> </span>answered in this
wise:</p>

<blockquote>" ** (The weight of authority is) that open, exclusive and
undisputed possession of alienable public land for the period prescribed by law
creates the legal fiction whereby the land, upon completion of the requisite
period ipso <span class="SpellE">jure</span> and without the need of judicial or
other sanction, ceases to be public land and becomes private property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>**</blockquote>

<blockquote>" ** ** **</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE"><i>Herico</i></span> (<i>supra</i>), in
particular, appears to be squarely affirmative:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">' *** Secondly, under the provisions of Republic Act No. 1942,
which the respondent Court held to be inapplicable to the petitioner's case,
with the latter's proven occupation and cultivation for more than 30 years
since 1914, by himself and by his predecessors-in-interest, <i>title over the
lands has vested on petitioner so as to segregate the land from the mass of
public land</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, it is no
longer disposable under the Public Land Act as by free patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * .</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'As interpreted in several
cases, when the conditions as specified in the foregoing provision are complied
with, the possessor is deemed to have acquired, by </span><i>operation </i><i><span style="">of law</span></i><span style="">, a right to a grant, a government grant, without the necessity of a
certificate of title being issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
land, therefore, ceased to be of the public domain and beyond the authority of
the Director of Lands to dispose of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>The
application for confirmation is a mere formality, the lack of which does not
affect the legal sufficiency of the title as would be evidenced by the patent
and the Torrens title to be issued upon the strength of said patent</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Nothing can more clearly demonstrate the logical
inevitability of considering possession of public land which is of the
character and duration prescribed by statute as the equivalent of an express
grant from the State than the dictum of the statute itself (Section 48 (b) of
C.A. No. 141) that the possessor(s) ' * * shall be conclusively presumed to
have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be
entitled to a certificate of title * * .' No proof being admissible to overcome
a conclusive presumption, confirmation proceedings would, in truth, be little
more than a formality, at the most limited to ascertaining whether the
possession claimed is of the required character and length of time; and
registration <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> would not confer title, but
simply recognize a title already vested.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proceedings would not originally convert the land from public to
private land, but only confirm such a conversion already effected by operation
of law from the moment the required period of <span style="">possession </span>became complete.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As was so well put in <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, ' * * (T)here
are indications that registration was expected from all, but none sufficient to
show that, for want of it, ownership actually gained would be lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect of the proof, wherever made, was
not to confer title, but simply to establish it, as already conferred by the
decree, if not by earlier law.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>" ** ** **</blockquote>

<blockquote>" ** The purely accidental circumstance that confirmation
proceedings were brought under the aegis of the 1973 Constitution which forbids
corporations from owning lands of the public domain cannot defeat a right
already vested before that law came into effect, or invalidate transactions
then perfectly valid and proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has already held, in analogous circumstances, that the Constitution
cannot impair vested rights."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The substantial identity
of the facts and issues between the case at bar and </span><i>Director of Lands
</i><i><span style="">v. I.A.C.</span></i><span style=""> being undeniable, and being cited to no
persuasive reason to decline to apply the doctrine in the latter to the former,
the Court, as aforesaid, has no alternative except to rule adversely to the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
