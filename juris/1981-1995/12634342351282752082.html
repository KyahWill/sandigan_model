<blockquote>"In the morning of September 12, 1988, Joseph Layong, a PC
constable with the Mt. <span style="">Province PC Command
at Bontoc, Mt. Province proceeded with other PC soldiers to Barrio Dantay,
Bontoc and, per instruction of their officer, Capt. Eugene Martin, put up a
checkpoint at the junction of the roads, one </span><span style="">going </span><span style="">to Sagada and the
other to Bontoc (TSN, November 9, 1989, pp. 3-4).  They stopped and checked all vehicles that went through the
checkpoint (TSN, April 5, 1990, p. 12).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">At about 9:15 A.M., Layong
and his teammate, Constable David Osborne Famocod (sic), saw and flagged down a
cream-colored Ford Fiera bearing Plate No. ABT-634 coming from the Bontoc
Poblacion and headed towards Baguio (TSN, November 9, 1989, pp. 4-5, 8).  The vehicle was driven by appellant and had
no passengers (TSN, November 9, 1989, pp. 4-5).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Layong and <span style="">his </span>companions
asked permission to inspect the vehicle and appellant acceded to the request
(TSN, November 9, 1989, pp. 4-5).  When
they peered into the rear of the vehicle, they saw a travelling bag which was
partially covered by the rim of a spare tire under the passenger seat on the right
side of the vehicle (TSN, <span style="">November 9,
1989, pp. 6, 10, 11).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Layong and his companions asked permission to see the contents of
the bag (TSN, November 9, 1989, p. 6).  Appellant consented to the request but told them that it only contained
some clothes (TSN, November 9, 1989, p. 6).  When Layong opened the bag, he found that it contained forty-one (41)
plastic packets of different sizes containing pulverized substances (TSN,
November 9, 1989, pp. 7, 9).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Layong gave a packet to his team leader, constable David Osborne
Fomocod, who, after sniffing the stuff concluded that it was marijuana (TSN,
November 9, 1989, p. 16).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The PC constables, together with appellant, boarded the latter's
Ford Fiera and proceeded to the Bontoc poblacion to report the incident to the
PC Headquarters (TSN, November 9, 1989, pp. 7-8).  The prohibited drugs were surrendered to the evidence custodian,
Sgt. Angel Pokling (TSN, November 9, 1989, pp. 7-8).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Major Carlos Figueroa, a PC Forensic Chemist at Camp Dangwa, La
Trinidad, Benguet, who has conducted more than 2500 professional examinations
of marijuana, shabu and cocaine samples, conducted two chemistry examinations
of the substance contained in the plastic packets taken from appellant and
found them to be positive for hashish or marijuana (TSN, October 24, 1990, pp.
3, 5-81)."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first assigned error, the accused contends that the
prosecution failed to prove that he is the owner of the marijuana found inside
the travelling bag which he had in his vehicle, a Ford Fiera.  Proof of ownership is immaterial.  Accused was prosecuted for the dispatching
in transit or transporting of prohibited drugs pursuant to Section 4, Article
II of R.A. No. 6425, as amended.  This
section does not require that for one to be liable for participating in any of
the proscribed transactions enumerated therein, he must be the owner of the
prohibited drug.  It simply reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.  <i>Sale,
Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Prohibited Drugs</i>.  -- The penalty of life imprisonment to death
and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be
imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer,
deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any
prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.  If the victim of the offense is a minor or
should a prohibited drug involved in any offense under this Section be the
proximate cause of the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein provided
shall be imposed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This section penalizes the <u>pusher</u>, who need not be the
owner of the prohibited drug.  The law
defines <u>pusher</u> as "any person who sells, administers, delivers, or
gives away to another, on any terms whatsoever, or distributes, dispatches in
transit or transports any dangerous drug or who acts as a broker in any of such
transactions, in violation of this Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

unlawful transportation of marijuana under the aforesaid Section 4, this Court
ruled that ownership is not a basic issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as proven by the prosecution, establish beyond cavil
that the accused was caught in the act of transporting the prohibited drug or,
in other words, <i>in flagrante delicto</i>.  That he knew fully well what he was doing is shown beyond moral
certainty by the following circumstances:  (a) the prohibited drug was found in a travelling bag, (b) he is the
owner of the said bag, (c) he concealed the bag behind a spare tire, (d) he was
travelling alone, and (e) the Ford Fiera in which he loaded the bag was under
his absolute control; pursuant to Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court (on
circumstantial evidence), the combination of all these circumstances is such as
to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.  Such circumstances, unrebutted by strong and convincing evidence
by the accused, even gave rise to the presumption that he is the owner of the
prohibited drug<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><sup><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">  The second assigned error is devoid of
merit.  The declaration in the joint
clarificatory sworn statement executed by the apprehending officers, that the
marijuana subject of the case was surreptitiously placed by an unknown person
in the bag of the accused, is not supported by evidence.  Said sworn statement cannot be used as a
basis for exoneration because the very same officers who signed the same
reiterated on the witness stand their statements in their original affidavit
implicating the accused; both the criminal complaint before the Municipal Trial
Court of Bontoc and the information in this case were based on this original
affidavit.  No probative value could be
assigned to it not only because it was procured by the defense under
questionable circumstances, but also because the affiants therein merely
expressed their personal opinion.  The
trial court's correct exposition on this point, to which nothing more may be
added, deserves to be quoted, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the portions of the âJoint Clarificatory Sworn
Statementâ of prosecution witnesses Layong and Fomocod cited (Exhs.
"I" to "I-C"; p. 155, Record), the defense would want this
Court to draw the inference that the accused Conway Omaweng is innocent as
confirmed by no <span style="">less </span>than the
persons who apprehended the suspect in flagranti (sic).  In other words, that the said accused is not
the owner of the contraband confiscated but someone else; that to (sic)
mysterious individual placed the prohibited articles inside the travelling bag
of the accused without the knowledge and consent of the latter; and that the
identity of this shadowy third person is known by the PC/INP
investigators.  The isolated
declarations, albeit under oath are much too asinine to be true and do not
affect the credibilities of the witnesses -- affiants and the truth of their
affirmations on the stand.  As gleaned
from parts of the record of the reÂ­investigation of this case conducted by the
Provincial Fiscal (Exhs. "G" and "D"; pp. 158 and 161,
Record), it appears that Layong and Fomocod were prevailed upon to affix their
signatures to (sic) the document styled as âJoint Clarificatory Sworn
Statementâ by interested persons in a vain ploy to extricate the accused from
the morass he got himself into.  Testifying in open court, the same witnesses maintained the tenor of
their original affidavit supporting the filing of the criminal complaint in the
lower court (Exh. "C"; p. 2, Record).  No additional information was elicited from said witnesses during
their examination from which it can reasonably be deduced that a third person
instead of the accused is the culprit and that the suspect is being framed-up
for a crime he did not commit.  Nonetheless, granting <i>arguendo</i> that the declarations of Layong
and Fomocod now the bone of contention, are on the level, the same are but mere
opinions and conclusions without bases.  Any which way, to believe that any person in his right mind owning
several kilos of hot hashish worth tens of thousands of pesos would simply
stash it away in the travelling bag of someone he has no previous agreement
with is a mockery of common sense.  And
to think further that the PC/INP agents know of such fact yet they kept the
vital information under âconfidential Statusâ (whatever that means in police
parlance) while an innocent person is being prosecuted and practically in the
shadow of the gallows for the offense would be stretching human credulity to
the snapping point.  By and large, the
fact remains as the circumstances logically indicate that the accused Conway
Omaweng has knowledge of the existence of the contraband inside his vehicle and
he was caught red-handed transporting the hot stuff."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The third assignment of error hardly deserves any
consideration.  Accused was not
subjected to any search which may be stigmatized as a violation of his
Constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
If one had been made, this Court would be the first to condemn it "as the
protection of the citizen and the maintenance of his constitutional rights is
one of the highest duties and privileges of the Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
He willingly gave prior consent to the search and voluntarily agreed to have it
conducted on his vehicle and travelling bag.  Prosecution witness Joseph Layong testified thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">Since in the course of the valid search forty-one (41) packages
