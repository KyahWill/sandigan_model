				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Early in the evening of September 9, 1982, a so-called
"saturation raid" was conducted in the area of <span class="SpellE">Morga</span>
Extension, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, by some eight (8) police
officers from Station 2 of the Western Police District.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The raid was undertaken avowedly in response
to reports of drug pushers and users in the area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It resulted, among others, in the
confiscation by the officers of an olive green traveling bag from the rented
room (in a house located at No. 344 <span class="SpellE">Morga</span> Extension)
in which Ursula <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> resided with her daughter,
Jocelyn and son, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bag was found to contain (a)
approximately one (1) gram of what appeared to be dried leaves of the flowering
tops of the <i>marijuana </i>plant wrapped in plastic; (b) five (5) plastic
packets or tea bags containing what also appeared to be dried <i>marijuana </i>leaves
and rolling paper; (c) fifty (50) plastic tea bags with rolling paper; and (d)
three (3) packages of OK brand rolling paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bag was surrendered to the police raiders by Jocelyn <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>, on request of her mother, Ursula <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The officers
were told that the bag belonged to a certain Allan <span class="SpellE">Asunto</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the policemen had taken custody of the traveling bag they
arrested Jaime Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span> who, according to an unnamed informant, were
carrying on the nefarious trade of drug pushing in the neighborhood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>
were arrested at the store owned by <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> and
Julia Marcos, situated opposite the house of Ursula <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both suspects were thereafter brought to
Station No. 2, together with Jocelyn and Loreto <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the police station, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>
signed a written statement, later marked Exhibit I,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> saying <a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a><i> </i>"that one day before
the opening of classes, his half-brother,** <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>, in the company of ** Jaime Garcia and Allan <span class="SpellE">Asunto</span>, arrived at his house at No. 344 <span class="SpellE">Morga</span>
Extension and there began wrapping marijuana that they were selling to the
neighborhood youth; that despite the fact that he told them to stop doing that
they did not listen to him; that it was is half-brother, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>,
who was supplying the capital for the purchase of marijuana; that it was Allan <span class="SpellE">Asunto</span> who was buying it; and that it was ** Jaime Garcia
who was vending the marijuana packed in plastic bags." When the forensic
examination<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
of the dried leaves surrendered to the police officers by Jocelyn <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
disclosed them to be marijuana leaves, <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> Jaime Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span> were booked,
placed under arrest, <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> and separately charged in the
Manila Regional Trial Court with the offense of selling or offering for sale,
without being authorized by law to do so, "dried marijuana leaves, which
are prohibited drugs," in violation of Section 4, Article II in relation
to Section 2 (e) (1), Article I of RA No. 6425, as amended by P.D. 1675,
otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act. <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused pleaded innocent on arraignment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cases were then consolidated on motion of
<span class="SpellE">Masibac</span> and jointly tried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the strength of the foregoing facts --
testified to by Sgt. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cerillo</span>, Jr., WPD, Station
2, and NBI Forensic Chemist <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> Francisco --
inclusive of the sworn statement of Loreto <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>
above adverted to, marked Exhibit I, which Loreto acknowledged to have signed
without reading and as to which he also asserted that the answers to sixteen
(16) of the twenty-one (21) questions recorded in said statement were not his
but those of the police investigators,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a> judgment was rendered by the
Regional Trial Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">8</span></span></a> finding both accused guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the offense ascribed to them and sentencing each of them
"to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, both ** to be credited in
full with the time they have been detained as prisoners, to pay a fine of
P20,000.00 with subsidiary imprisonment in cases of insolvency, and to pay the
costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">Both Jaime Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span> have appealed and before this Court pray for
acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their plea will be
granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They will be absolved of the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will at once be noted that there is no evidence worthy of the
name establishing the <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> of the crime imputed
to the appellants: <i>selling, or offering for sale dried marijuana leaves</i>.<i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></i>The appellants were not found to be in
possession of any leaves at the time of their arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As much is admitted by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cerillo</span>, who pertinently deposed, on cross examination,
that the appellants were frisked and found to be negative of marijuana leaves,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">9</span></span></a>
although he had earlier declared, on direct examination, that some dried
marijuana leaves had been found stuck in the left pocket of Jaime Garcia's
trousers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">10</span></span></a>
Both appellants, testifying in their behalf, denied having any marijuana at the
time they were apprehended and searched.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
Marcos, one of the owners of the store in front of which the appellants had
been accosted by the police officers, saw the apprehension and search of the
suspects and categorically declared that no marijuana leaves were found on the
person of either of them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> Furthermore, neither Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cerillo</span> nor anyone else ever testified that either of the
appellants had actually sold marijuana, or offered it for sale, to anybody.</p>

<p class="BODY">While there is some indication in the record that Jaime Garcia
verbally admitted to the investigating officer participation in the
drug-trafficking in the area,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> the use of such admission against
him is ruled out by the fact that it was not made in the presence of his lawyer
and by the absence of any proof of its having been preceded by the so-called
"Miranda warnings" or advisories held by this Court as indispensable
to the admission in evidence of extra-judicial confessions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tenuous and incompetent character of that
alleged admission is in truth underscored by the lack of any mention of it in
either the appealed decision or the People's brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court obviously relied on the written statement of
Loreto <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span>, Exhibit I, to the effect that
appellants, together with Allan <span class="SpellE">Asunto</span>, were placing
marijuana in small plastic packets for sale to the neighborhood youth, and had
paid no heed to his request that they stop doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was improper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As above pointed out, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span> had disowned the statement when presented to him
for identification at the trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> Moreover, since Loreto <span class="SpellE">Masibac</span> never gave evidence on the witness box of the facts
set out in said statement, the use of the statement as evidence against the
appellants was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the well known rule of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> inter <span class="SpellE">alios</span> <span class="SpellE">acta</span> </i>embodied in Section 25, Rule 130 of the Rules of
Court:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"The rights of a party
cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another **."
Neither may the statement be received, exceptionally, as an admission by a
conspirator in accordance with Section 27 of the same Rule, since not even a
pretense is made that the alleged author of the statement was ever a
co-conspirator and had made the statement in relation to the conspiracy and
during its existence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The indications are that the traveling bag in which the marijuana
was found belonged to Allan <span class="SpellE">Asunto</span>, who apparently
has not been apprehended to this day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is the Trial Court's finding, in fact, derived from the testimony
of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cerillo</span>, the chief prosecution witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance, and the fact that no
marijuana was found on the persons of the appellants when searched shortly
after the traveling bag had been confiscated by the raiding party, and the
additional fact that the appellants’ places of residence were quite far from
the site of the raid, further erode the case against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court must therefore hold that the evidence on record fails
to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission by the appellants of the
offense described in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed against
them, or even of the crime, necessarily included in that charged, of illegal
possession of prohibited drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
constitutional presumption of innocence on their part has not been
destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They must be acquitted.</p>
