				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with
prayer for preliminary injunction, herein petitioner, Philippine National Bank
(or PNB for brevity), seeks the reversal of the decision of the Court of
Appeals in AC-G.R. No. CV-02959-R, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>, Plaintiffs-Appellants vs. Domingo Molina, Orlando
Molina and <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> Molina, Defendants-<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>," reversing the judgment appealed from and
ordering petitioner to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> one-half of the
mortgaged land in favor of herein private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> were
the original owners of a 4,161 sq. meter-lot registered under OCT No. 5253,
Free Patent No. 27945 (pp. 3-4, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) situated at <span class="SpellE">Cabinitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Catanduanes</span></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In May, 1977, the business partners, Domingo, Orlando and <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span>, all surnamed Molina, were looking for a lot in <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> where they could put up a furniture shop and a ‘<span class="SpellE">chicharon</span>’ factory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents <span class="SpellE">Matienzos</span> offered to sell their
lot in <span class="SpellE">Cabinitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>,
for the price of P10 per square meter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Molinas</span> wanted to buy only one-half
of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">An
affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> C) <span class="GramE">was</span>
executed by the parties containing the following memorandum of their agreement:</p>

<p class="BODY">That the true intention of the parties in the Deed of Sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) <span class="GramE">to</span> be executed by them was
for the transfer of ownership over one-half only (2,080 sq. meters) of <span class="SpellE">Matienzo's</span> property, but the other half (2,081 sq. meters)
would be included in the sale for the purpose of facilitating the
defendant-partners’ loan and to use it as additional collateral to enable them
to secure a bigger loan from PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, they agreed that after five (5) or ten (10) years, Orlando
Molina would, at his own expense, cause the other half portion of the land to
be surveyed and titled in the name of <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Orlando Molina issued a promissory note (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B) <span class="GramE">for</span> P20,800, payable in installments as the price
of the 2,080-sq.-meter portion of <span class="SpellE">Matienzo's</span>
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Both the
affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> C) <span class="GramE">and</span>
the promissory note (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) <span class="GramE">were</span>
signed by Orlando Molina.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, when the Deed of Absolute <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) <span class="GramE">was</span> presented to <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> for signing on <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1977</st1:date>, Domingo Molina appeared as vendee,
instead of <st1:city><st1:place>Orlando</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The spouses wondered why that was so, but
they were assured that there would be no problem because Domingo Molina was one
of the partners to the proposed business venture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Convinced of the group's sincerity, the
respondent spouses signed the Deed of Absolute Sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1978</st1:date>,
Domingo Molina sold the whole parcel of land to Orlando Molina for the same
price of P20<span class="GramE">,800</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, Transfer Certificate of Title 1332 was
issued in the name of Orlando Molina (p. 3, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1979</st1:date>,
Orlando Molina mortgaged the entire lot to the PNB branch in <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> for P15<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants were able to pay <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
only P3<span class="GramE">,350</span> out of the P20,000 price of the sale of
one-half of their property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite
repeated demands for payment, the <span class="SpellE">Molinas</span> defaulted.</p>

<p class="BODY">They also defaulted in paying the PNB loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PNB foreclosed the real estate mortgage and
purchased the mortgaged property as the highest bidder at the public auction
sale which was conducted on <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="3">March 10,
 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 31, 1981, the <span class="SpellE">Matienzos</span> filed
an action for <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> of Title, Recovery of
Ownership and Possession, Annulment of the Document and Damages (Civil Case No.
1105), against defendants Domingo Molina, Orlando Molina and the <u>Manager</u>
of PNB <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> Branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later, the complaint was amended to include another defendant, <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> Molina.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1983</st1:date>,
the Regional Trial Court, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 43, <u>dismissed</u>
the case insofar as the defendant Manager of PNB <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>
Branch was concerned (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"A perusal of the complaint will readily show that even if
all the allegations in the complaint are admitted, there is no liability on the
part of defendant PNB Manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This case
therefore as against the defendant PNB Manager is hereby dismissed.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"The counterclaim contained in the answer of defendant PNB
Manager is also hereby dismissed as he could have prayed for the dismissal of
the complaint as against him right after </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">receipt of the copy thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, PNB consolidated its ownership over the mortgaged
land.</p>

<p class="BODY">In August 1983, Orlando Molina deposited with PNB <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> Branch the amount of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span>
as earnest money for the redemption of the foreclosed property.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, the lower court on <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1984</st1:date>, dismissed Civil Case No. 1105.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found "that no actionable wrong
amounting to fraud <span class="GramE">were</span> (sic) committed by defendants
to entitle plaintiffs to the relief prayed for" (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Upon appeal by the <span class="SpellE">Matienzos</span>
to the Court of Appeals (AC-G.R.</span> No CV-02959-R), the appellate court
reversed the appealed judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of its decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1985</st1:date> (Annex C, pp.
27-41, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) reads thus:</p>

attorney's fees and litigation expenses, plus costs."</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon remand of the case to the trial court for execution, the
court issued, on motion of the plaintiffs, an order placing in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span> the
P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> earnest money deposited by Orlando Molina in
the PNB (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1987</st1:date>,
the court issued an alias writ of execution ordering the PNB <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> Branch to turn over to the sheriff the amount of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> as partial execution of the appellate court's
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An urgent motion for
reconsideration of the order was filed by PNB on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <u>February 12, 1988</u>, the trial court issued an order of
execution against Domingo and Orlando Molina to pay the unpaid balance of
P17,450 of the price of the 2,080 square meters sold to them by <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>, and -</p>

Branch, and the plaintiffs-appellants." <span class="GramE">(Annex D, p. 42,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1988</st1:date>,
PNB filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court,
alleging mainly:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>That the Court of
Appeals had no jurisdiction to render the judgment against it; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>That the decision of the
Court of Appeals deprives it of its property without due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, we issued a
temporary restraining order to stop the implementation of the writ of execution
issued pursuant to the order of February 12, 1988 and the decision dated
October 31, 1985 of the Court of Appeals in case AC-G.R. CV No. 02959-R (p. 44,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> died and she
was substituted by her heirs (p. 79, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals was aware of the dismissal of the complaint
against the PNB manager for that fact was mentioned in the appealed decision of
the trial court (Annex B, p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) and in its
own decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"On June 18, 1983, the then Acting Presiding Judge in this
Court, Hon. Silvestre S. Felix, dismissed the case insofar as defendant Manager
PNB <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> Agency is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To which dismissal <span class="GramE">no
opposition nor</span> appeal was interposed by the plaintiffs." <span class="GramE">(p. 28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the PNB was not a party in the suit (only its manager was
sued and then dropped from the complaint) both the trial court and the Court of
Appeals did not acquire jurisdiction over said Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals' decision ordering the
Bank to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
one-half of the land which it had purchased at the foreclosure <span class="GramE">sale,</span> was therefore null and void for lack of jurisdiction
(Paramount Insurance Corporation vs. Luna, 148 SCRA 564; <span class="SpellE">Hyopsung</span>
Maritime Co., Ltd. vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 77369, August 31, 1988).</p>

<blockquote><i>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
For the respondent court, in the instant case, to have rendered a decision
against petitioners who were neither appellants nor <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
in the appeal brought before said court, is to act entirely without
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a corollary, petitioners
would also be denied due process, never having been put on notice that they
were involved </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in the appeal so
that they would have tried to prevent the appellate court from rendering an
adverse decision against them in </span>the ordinary course </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of law." (Fernando Go, et al. vs. Court
of Appeals, et al. G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-25393, </span></span></i><st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="10"><span class="GramE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals ordering the PNB to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> one-half of the lot in question to <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> without giving PNB a chance to defend its own
title to the property, furthermore constitutes a deprivation of property
without due process, hence, null and void for that cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mere service of the appellants' brief on PNB did not operate to
bring the Bank into the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jurisdiction over a person is acquired by service of summons and copy of
the complaint on him (Rule 14, Rules of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>PNB could not be expected to answer the appellants' brief not only
because it was not a party in the appeal (<span class="GramE">nor</span> in the
trial court) but also because the dismissal of the complaint against the PNB
manager in <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> was not one of the errors argued in
the appellants' brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court and the Court of Appeals found as a fact that, as
stated in the affidavit of Orlando Molina (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C). -</p>

<blockquote><i>"<span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
allowed </i><st1:city><st1:place><i>Orlando</i></st1:place></st1:city><i> Molina
to use the other half of the property as additional collateral of a loan to be
made with the DBP (sic)."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that when plaintiffs entered into the
contract of sale of the lot in question, they knew the purpose for which the
property was being purchased by the defendants Domingo Molina and Orlando
Molina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated by <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, the reduction of the consideration in the Deed
of Sale was explained to the plaintiffs, without them interposing any
objection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plan of the defendants Orlando
Molina and <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> Molina to mortgage the property in
question to the PNB or other banking institution to obtain capital for the
business they intended to put <span class="GramE">up,</span> was likewise
explained to plaintiff spouses, as borne out by the testimony of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> (pp. 31-32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For that
reason, <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> signed the Deed of Sale for the
whole of his land, although the true agreement with Molina was to sell to him
only one-half of it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, the trial court correctly found no fraud
or deceit both in the execution of the deed of sale by <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
and in the mortgage of the whole lot to the PNB by Molina.</p>

<p class="BODY">PNB was an innocent mortgagee (and purchaser) of the property for
value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It had no notice of the adverse
claim of <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> to one-half of the mortgaged
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The title in the name of
Orlando Molina was clean.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The filing of
Civil Case No. 1105, <u>after</u> the property had been sold to the Bank at the
foreclosure sale, did not invalidate the sale <span class="GramE">nor</span> the
title of the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="GramE">Court of Appeals’</span> finding that the
order dismissing the complaint against the Bank's manager in <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> "has never become final" (p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) has no basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true, as observed by the Court, that the PNB was an
indispensable party in Civil Case No. 1105 without whom no complete relief
could be accorded to the plaintiffs (p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
the fact is it was never actually joined as a defendant in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Bank manager in <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>
(who was sued but later dropped from the complaint) is not the PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is only an employee of the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon noticing that an indispensable party had
not been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>, the Court of Appeals should have
sent back the case to the trial court for it to order the plaintiffs to amend
their complaint, bring in the PNB as an additional defendant, and for the Bank
to answer the amended complaint and present its evidence in the case (<span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Español</span>-Filipino vs. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, 37 Phil. 921; <span class="SpellE">Infante</span>
vs. Toledo, 44 Phil. 834; <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> vs. Romero, L-15195,
March 29, 1961).</p>

<p class="BODY">Sending a copy of the appellants' brief to a lawyer of the Bank
in the <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> agency was not the proper way to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither could it be done by a peremptory declaration in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the Court's decision that the PNB
"is hereby ordered and declared a party in this appeal" even if it
never was (p. 41, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>
