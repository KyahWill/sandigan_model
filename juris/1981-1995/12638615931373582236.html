</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">According to appellants, it was <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> who asked for the extension because she was not

</span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> said that it was
appellants who asked for it because the title of the property was not yet </span>cleared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court below believed <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
because on said date the Development Bank had not yet executed the deed of
cancellation of mortgage, and no title has yet been issued for the driveway

<blockquote>Immediately, upon execution by the DBP of the deed of cancellation
of mortgage of <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1984</st1:date>,

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for the formal execution of

<span class="SpellE">Rodes</span>, calling on <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to perform her part of the contract because "the title to the house and

</span>The levy on execution has long been lifted, the mortgage indebtedness
released, the portion of the public land used as </span>driveway has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">long been awarded and fully paid for the City

transferred in your name upon execution of </span>the contract of sale. .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Your refusal will compel Us to sue for

<blockquote>Before appellants could make good their threat, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
"jumped the gun", so to speak, upon them by filing in court on <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1984</st1:date> the case for recovery
of sum of money with damages which is now this case on appeal before Us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In her complaint, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> alleged that
she gave appellants spouses P200,000.00 upon their assurances that they could
transfer to her the house and lot she was buying from them free from any liens
and encumbrances, including the furnishings thereof and the adjacent lot being
used as driveway, on June 25, 1984, but that day had come and passed without
appellants being able to make good their promise, because she "discovered
to her shock and dismay that she had been dealt with in bad faith by
defendants" as the mortgage on the property was not released or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">cancelled and the driveway was still public
land and could not be validly transferred to her as any disposition thereof
would yet </span>require approval by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the suit against appellants spouses for
recovery of the P200,000.00 earnest money which is, in essence and concept, one
for rescission with damages.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
assailing the conclusion of the respondent Court of Appeals that the private
respondents had not committed a substantial breach of their obligation and
therefore, there was no legal basis for the judgment ordering rescission of the
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners maintain that
since private respondents were not prepared to convey the title to the subject
property on the date agreed upon in view of the various liens and encumbrances
thereon, the former are entitled to rescind the contract pursuant to Article
1191 of the Civil Code which states:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 1191.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The power to
rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors
should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the
rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may also seek rescission, even after he
has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just
cause authorizing the fixing of a period.</blockquote>

persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with articles 1385 and 1388

partiesâ€™ pleadings, the Court finds the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">instant

<p class="BODY">That the power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal
ones in case one of the obligors should not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

of the Civil Code provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
it is equally settled that, in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary,
this power must be invoked judicially; it cannot be exercised solely on a

<p class="BODY">Alternatively, petitioner seeks annulment of the contract on the
ground of fraud since private respondents had misrepresented to her that they
could validly convey title to the property subject of the contract which
however is encumbered with various existing liens.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The alleged breach of the obligation by the private respondents,
which consists in a mere delay for a few days in clearing the title to the
property, cannot be considered substantial enough to warrant rescission of the
contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">A thorough review of the records clearly indicates that private
respondents had substantially complied with their undertaking of clearing the
title to the property which has a total land area of 886 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be pointed out that the subject lot
consists of private land, with an area of 548 square meters, covered by TCT No.
T-13826 and of a portion of the public land which has been awarded to the
private respondents under <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span> Sales Application
No. 7-676-A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While TCT No. T-13826 was
subject to a mortgage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>favor
of DBP, private respondents, upon receipt of the earnest money paid by
petitioner, utilized the same to settle its obligations with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">DBP </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">thus </span>enabling them to secure a cancellation of the existing
mortgage, which was duly noted in the title to the property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">[<u>See</u> </span>Original Records, p. 94.]</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled principle of law that rescission will not be
permitted for a slight or casual breach of the contract but only for such
breaches as are so substantial and fundamental as to defeat the object of the
parties in making the agreement (Universal<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">
Food </span>Corporation v. Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

741.] A court, in determining whether rescission is warranted, must exercise its
discretion judiciously considering that the question of whether a breach of a
contract is substantial depends upon the attendant circumstances [Corpus v. <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>, <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>, G.R. Nos. L-23720 and

<p class="BODY">In this case, as to the lot covered by TCT No. T-13826, it is
true that as of <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1984</st1:date>,
the date set for the execution of the final deed of sale, the mortgage lien in
favor of DBP annotated in the title has not yet been cancelled as it took DBP
some time in processing the papers relative thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, just a few days after, or on <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1984</st1:date>, the cancellation of
the DBP mortgage was entered by the Register of Deeds and duly noted on the
title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Time not being of the essence in
the agreement, a slight delay on the part of the private respondents in the
performance of their obligation, is not sufficient ground for the resolution of
the agreement [<span class="SpellE">Biando</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espanto</span>

</span>The rule in this jurisdiction is that where the fulfillment of the
condition (in a conditional obligation) does not depend on the will of the
obligor, but on that of a third person, the obligor's part of the contract is
complied with, if he does all that is in his power and it then becomes

<p class="BODY">Here, since the land in question had already been awarded to
private respondents since 1972 and all the requirements of the law for the
purchase of public land were subsequently complied with, private respondents,
as owners of said property, can properly convey title thereto to petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the private respondents are ready, willing and able
to comply with their obligation to deliver title to the property subject of the
sale and had already demanded that petitioner pay the full amount of the purchase
price, the petitioner must be considered as having incurred in delay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is warranted by the clear
provision of Article 1169 of the Civil Code which states:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 1169.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those obliged to

<p class="BODY">It is basic that the breach of a contract gives the aggrieved

rescind the contract or to ask for specific performance (<span class="SpellE">Nagarmull</span>

the house and lot they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">were </span>selling

indebtedness and clear up the title (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 60.]
The testimony of petitioner herself shows that she was furnished with <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies of the title, at the back of which was a
memorandum of the encumbrances on the property [TSN, September 30, 1985, p. 4.]

petitioner and payment by petitioner of the balance of the purchase price
immediately upon finality of such judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

ninety (90) days within which petitioner shall pay the balance of the purchase
price amounting to one million and five hundred fifty thousand pesos
(P1,550,000.00) plus interest thereon at the legal rate from finality of this
