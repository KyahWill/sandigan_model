<p class="BODY">On November 13, 1968, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, 11
years old and a fourth grade student at Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
College was kidnapped in front of his own house at <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1968</st1:date>, Ricardo's father, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>, a wealthy Chinese businessman received a series of
telephone calls informing him that Ricardo was in the callers' custody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The callers demanded a ransom of P45<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for the boy's release.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> pleaded that the ransom be reduced since he did not
have that much cash.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The kidnappers also
instructed <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> that
Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span>, a housemaid of the Sys should be the one

CIS agent <span class="SpellE">Winifredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Recuenco</span>,

kidnappers with the police authorities trailing her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, this scheme did not work out
as <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> deliberately failed to follow the detailed
instructions on the route she should take and how delivery of the money should
be <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the morning of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">November 15, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> took the
bus instead of a taxi as ordered by <span class="SpellE">Recuenco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the police authorities </span>were not
able to trail her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon her return, <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> stated that she took the bus and went to the place <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is a</span>s
instructed by the kidnappers but the kidnappers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Two days after, or on <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="11">November
 17, 1968</st1:date>, the body of the kidnapped boy was discovered concealed in
<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>culvert at the canal near the
gate of the Sys' house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Ernesto <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P. </span>Jimenez, NBI medico-legal officer
who conducted the autopsy on Ricardo's cadaver found that the body was bloated

skin and peeling off of the epidermal layer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">on </span>the upper part of the body:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>that there were abrasions on the left cheek, scalp, neck, left elbow
region <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>on the right and left
wrist; that aside from a wound on the left and right ankles and second degree
burns on the right arm, there was a rope tied around the left foot, ankle
region, and a piece of electric wire tied on the right foot, ankle region
(Exhibit E); and, that there was a piece of rope, which looked like a piece of
cotton, wrapped around the neck of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Exhibit B-6).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to Dr. Jimenez, the causes of death of Ricardo were the
injuries on the head, severe and traumatic, which were possibly inflicted by <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>blunt instrument or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">object </span>directed to the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>back portion of the head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctor concluded that the injuries
sustained could have been perpetrated two (2) days earlier, more or less,
before the actual necropsy examination was conducted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1968</st1:date>,
the provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> filed <span class="GramE">an amended</span> information which charged the appellants plus
Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span>, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Superada</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> de <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> with the
crime of kidnapping for ransom with murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Superada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> de <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> could not be tried
as they have remained at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of the prosecution, Rolando Blanco was discharged
from the information so that he could testify as a state witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial lasted for about eight years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the retirement of Judge <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Flores who first handled the trial, Judge Ricardo L.
<span class="SpellE">Pronove</span>, now an Associate Justice of the Court of <span class="GramE">Appeals,</span> took over and promul­gated the decision which
acquitted Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> and convicted the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court ruled that Rolando Blanco's testimony was
sufficient to establish the guilt of all the appellants, independently of the
extra-judicial statements executed by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Blanco's testimony was correctly summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Rolando Blanco was a worker in a furniture shop at <span class="SpellE">Lerma</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rizal</span></span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being a relative of a maid employed in the
household, he was allowed by <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>,
the father of the victim Rolando <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, to live in the
garage of the house which was located at Sta. Ana, <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few
days before <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1968</st1:date>,
Blanco met his first cousin, the accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Guibao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Planillo</span>, alias Antonio <span class="SpellE">Guibao</span>,
in the furniture shop where he was working.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the occasion, <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span> requested Blanco to
go to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Caltex</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

  Cruz St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at
<span class="SpellE">M<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">andaluyong</span></span></span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, so that he could meet his companions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with the request, Blanco went
to the gasoline station on <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="11">November
 10, 1968</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening where, aside from his cousin <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span>,
he met the other accused, namely, Jose <span class="SpellE">Galban</span>, Jose
Bautista, <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span>
Vargas, <span class="SpellE">Leodegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>
alias Ruben <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, and a certain <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The meeting
lasted for about five (5) minutes but during this brief period, <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span> was able to introduce to Blanco accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> as the "boss"' and to inform him that the
group was planning to kidnap Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, one of the
children of the owner of the house where he was living.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this meeting also, accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> told Blanco in a point blank manner that if he
would reveal the plot to anybody, he would be killed, a threat which was
repeated by accused <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> Vargas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As required by accused <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, Blanco agreed to act as an observer, to
monitor the movements of the people in the house of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> whose son was the intended victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, Blanco was asked by accused <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span> to go home early and to report to the group the
identity of the people going to the house of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the meeting, Blanco went home where he met <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> and the "<span class="SpellE">labandera</span>"' who was his aunt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But because he was afraid of the threat
earlier made by accused <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Planillo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>and
<span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, he did not reveal to either this aunt or <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> what he had seen and
heard.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1968</st1:date>,
while standing near the gate of the house of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span></span>,
Blanco saw an approaching red Volkswagen beetle car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vehicle was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

and seated beside him in the front seat were the accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>
and Vargas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rear seat of the vehicle
was occupied by the other four accused and when the car stopped, accused <span class="SpellE">Galban</span> called Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, a young
boy, who was<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>then driving a
motor cycle in front of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Responding to the call, Ricardo <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Sy</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> Vargas then immediately <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">covered </span>the mouth of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and with that, the beetle car sped away.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

on his way to work at <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">cousin, </span>accused
<span class="SpellE">Planillo</span> called him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Planillo</span> was then riding on the same
Volkswagen car in the company of accused <span class="SpellE">Galban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, Vargas, Bautista and de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span>
informed Blanco that the group had already kidnapped Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> said that the
ransom money would be fixed in the amount of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">P45<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A</span>nd, accused de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos added that
accused Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> was the one to be asked to
deliver the ransom money somewhere in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this meeting, which lasted for
about ten to fifteen minutes, accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> again
warned Blanco not to tell anyone what had already transpired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later on, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, Blanco heard <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">his </span>co-accused
talking about the money which Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> carried and
which they discovered to be <span class="GramE">fake</span>.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After working the entire morning on <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1968</st1:date>, at the same furniture shop in
<span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Blanco
met again <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Galban</span>,
Bautista and de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
at the same gasoline station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span> informed Blanco that they were going to the place
where Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> was being kept, all boarded the red
Volkswagen car, belonging to <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, which proceeded
to a "barong­-barong" located at the squatters area somewhere in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside
the "barong?barong", Blanco watched the hands and feet of
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> tied with a rope behind his back and his
mouth gagged with a piece of black cloth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Guarding the prostrate boy at the time were accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> Vargas who later on, were joined by
accused <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> de <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Superada</span> and a certain <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because accused <span class="SpellE">Galban</span>
was the driver of the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> family, he told Blanco that
it would be better to have the boy killed because Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
could readily identify them to the authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> also said that since the money
brought by Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> <span class="GramE">were</span>
fake, they had decided to kill Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the suggestion, accused <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> Vargas volunteered to kill Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and although Blanco sympathized with the plight of the
boy, he felt powerless to do anything because he had to follow their<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> gang leader, </span>accused <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

thereafter ordered Blanco to return to the house of the victim and observe any
development.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, at about 6:30
o'clock in the evening, Blanco stationed himself at the gate of the house of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> while at the same time,
positioned at a street corner near the house were the accused <span class="SpellE">Planillo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Galban</span> and
Bautista.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few moments later, the same

whose hands were still tied with rope and whose mouth was still gagged with the
same black piece of cloth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result,
the boy fell down and at that instant, accused <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span>
Vargas hit Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> on the head twice with an iron

shoved the body of the victim inside a culvert and the death weapon, which
measured about 1 foot and 10 inches in length 3 to 5 lbs. in weight, was handed
by accused <span class="SpellE">Galban</span> to Rolando Blanco for
safekeeping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon receiving it, Blanco
hid the iron pipe in a room on top of the garage where he was staying."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As their main defense, the appellants question the credibility of

effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants specifically
stress the improbability of Blanco's testimony that eight of the accused
arrived in a red Volkswagen beetle immediately before the kidnapping
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They submit that a small
Volkswagen beetle whose </span>normal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">capacity
is five passengers could not have possibly </span>accommodated nine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(9) people including Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Blanco under

by the accused in front of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">his </span>house
at about six o'clock in the evening at the time when police authorities were

raise the following query:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why was the
killing not carried out in the squatter's area in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City which was a secluded place wherein no one could have possibly witnessed
the crime?</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision to kill Ricardo in front of his own house is
explained by the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 15, 1968, CIS agent <span class="SpellE">Winifredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Recuenco</span> tried to entrap the kidnappers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, this entrapment was to be
executed by the operatives trailing Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> who,
upon the insistence of the kidnappers was to bring and deliver the money at a
certain place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the use of a
vicinity map, Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> pointed to a place along
East Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, near the squat­ter's area
where she intended to wait for the person who would receive the ransom money at
about 11:00 o'clock that morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
"fake" money was then wrapped in a newspaper and placed in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">s</span>ide a traveling bag in the presence of

kidnappers</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This plan, however,
failed because Alice did not follow the pre-agreed plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of taking a taxi to East Avenue, as
agreed upon, she followed the kidnapper's instructions and took <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>bus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later on, Alice informed <span class="SpellE">Recuenco</span>
that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> she</span> did not meet the
kidnappers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">At around 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> was

to the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> residence.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of the same day, another
telephone call was received.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This time
the caller spoke to Alice <span class="SpellE">Grino</span> who reported that the
kidnappers decided not to appear because they were aware of the trap set up for
them and because the ransom money was composed of fake bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances indicate that the kidnappers were fully informed
about all the movements of the police authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had a "mole" inside the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> household who listened during the planning of the
entrapment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the knowledge that at
about 6:00 o'clock in the evening of November 15, 1968, the police authorities
would be somewhere else in East Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
trying to entrap them, they were confident that they could kill Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>front of his house at <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> without fear of being discovered.</p>

<p class="BODY">The perversity of the kidnappers and their callous disregard for
the life of an innocent child are shown by the fact that upon learning of the
entrapment plan and about the pieces of paper or fake money being readied to
fool them, they did not hesitate to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">kill </span>the small boy in a place and manner calculated
to shock and teach the family, and possibly others, a never to be forgotten
lesson.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have no doubt about the credibility of Rolando Blanco.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted his participation in the
kidnapping of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and about his having
monitored or observed the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show any
improper motive on his part to falsely implicate the appellants to this
diabolic crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Guibao</span> is his first cousin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">We likewise find implausible the contention that the failure to
similarly maltreat and coerce <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, the mastermind

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i>J</i>.:<u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I regret I cannot join the majority in affirming the conviction
of the accused-appellants because I do not think they have been proved
guilty.  My feeling is that the case
against them, based mainly on their supposed confessions and the testimony of
the state witness, has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, all the defendants from whom the sworn statements
had been taken testified to repudiate them, claim­ing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">they </span>had been manhandled and coerced into confessing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, Planillo said he was arrested in Samar and brought to
Tacloban City, where he was mauled for two hours until he finally signed his
confession.  He identified his two NBI
assailants but he could not complain later for fear of more maltreatment.  He was also denied the services of counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Bautista said he was blindfolded, boxed, kicked in the face, electric-shocked
and subjected to karate blows by the Mandaluyong police and CIS agents, who
also denied him counsel when he requested one.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
De los Santos said his handwritten confession was dictated to him after he was
boxed and his private parts were electrified, and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">he </span>signed another confession because of similar torture in­flicted
on him, by three agents he identified by name, that caused chest pains and
broken teeth, as certified by the Rizal Provincial Hospital.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Galban, the driver of the Sy family, said he was tortured at Camp Crame and was
forced to sign a prepared statement while a gun was poked at his back.  He was also denied counsel and claimed he,
with Blanco and Bautista, was subjected to sexual indignities and was forced to
sip his own urine.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Vargas said he voluntarily went to Camp Crame when he learned he was being
sought and claimed he was manhandled by the Man­daluyong police and CIS agents
into signing a confession.  They burned
his nape with cigarette butts.  He was
electric-shocked.  They terrified him by
pointing a gun at his temple and clicking it three times.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that except for Recuenco, who denied the
manhandling imputed to him, none of the peace officers who were named by the
several accused-appellants was pre­sented by the prosecution to refute the
charges of torture made against them.  As for the argument that the confessions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">were signed before the fiscal and media men without com­plaint, the
appellants did not speak then because they were afraid of further punishment
from the police, as Planillo testified.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion places much reliance on the handwritten
confession of De los Santos, stressing it was written so evenly as to suggest a
disposition free from pressure or constraint.  Considering the way it was composed, it could also suggest that it was
copied or dictated after he had been given a chance to relax and assured that
there would be no more punishment for him.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the trial court said that it could "not turn a deaf
ear to the charges of torture and indignities" to which the defendants had
been subjected, it nevertheless convicted them just the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">I have no doubt that violence and intimidation were really used
against the accused-appellants, given the practice then (and sometimes even
now) of overzealous investigators securing confessions through methods less
than legal.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">The </span>employment of such vices of consent had the effect of
nullifying the confessions and rendered them inadmissible against the persons
who had allegedly signed them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus discarding the said confessions and considering the denials
of involvement in the crime by all the accused-appellants, we are left only
with the testimony of the accused-turned-state witness, Blanco.  There are a few intriguing parts in his
narration of the crime that I believe should have been examined more carefully.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first is his account of the actual commission of the
kidnaping on November 13, 1968, in front of the vic­tim's house in Sta. Ana,
Mandaluyong, Rizal, which is not exactly secluded.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to him, this was done by forcing Ricardo Sy into a
Volkswagen Beetle which was then occupied by the eight defendants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Five of them were seated in the back and the other three in front.  The boy made the ninth occupant in that
small car,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and let it be added he must have been struggling in fright and fighting
desperately to be free.  Eight full-grown
men and one resisting boy in a Beetle, whose normal capacity is only five
passengers?  The Beetle is a two-door
car, certainly not the most convenient vehicle for a kidnaping, and this was to
be done in front of the victim's own house, at only six o'clock in the early
evening.  Considering all these
inconveniences, one can only wonder why all eight defendants should choose to
ride together in that small car on that crucial occasion, like the Keystone
Cops in a ludicrous skit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Was it for the purpose of involving all of them in the crime they
were about to perpetrate, of committing every one to the common plot, as the
majority opinion suggests?  If <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so, </span>then why was Blanco himself not
taken along with the rest, to make him equally implicated and guilty?</p>

<p class="BODY">The second part of his testimony that also challenges belief has
to do with the actual commission of the killing of the boy on November 15,
1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">By Blanco's own testimony, the victim was secured in a house in
the squatter area in Quezon City, and it was there that it was decided he
should be killed because the ransom had not been delivered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Yet, strangely enough, the plan was in the end not carried out in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">safety </span>and seclusion of that as yet
undiscovered hide-out.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead, the boy was brought back to the vicinity of his own
house, where the presence of police might be expected as the kidnaping was then
still under investigation, again at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">six
</span>o'clock in the early evening, and in plain view of whoever else might
happen to be in that relatively busy place.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the ultimate in der<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">ring</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">-do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There the child was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dragged
</span>out of the car still bound and gagged.  When he had fallen to the ground, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span>fatally struck twice in the head with a lead pipe.  Thereafter, they tied him up some more with
a rope weighted with a rock as if they intended to sink him to the bottom of
the ocean to prevent discovery.  Instead
they pushed him into a nearby culvert, with a part of the body exposed, and it
was there that the decomposing corpse was disco­vered two days later.  Blanco added that Vargas gave him the lead
pipe, which he kept in his room in the garage, probably to cherish as a
keepsake.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If the account of the kidnaping assumes an element of the comical
were it not for the ensuing tragedy, the account of the murder borders on
stupidity, which I am not prepared to impute to the accused-appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant that the judge who wrote the deci­sion in this
case <u>was not the same judge who presided </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">at </span>the trial when Blanco testified</u> on direct and cross-exami­nations.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, as counsel for Ladrera aptly observed "the time-honored doctrine
that the Supreme Court will not interfere with the findings of fact of the
trial court with respect to the credibility of witnesses has no application
here.  That doctrine is based on the assumption
that the trial judge has observed the norm of testifying of the wit­nesses,
including their facial expression and tone of voice.  These, however, cannot he reproduced in the transcript of
stenographic notes."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For all the abhorrence this crime has provoked and
notwithstanding the popular sentiment generated against the defendants, the
simple fact is that the evidence of the prosecution is just not enough to
convict them.  The improbable testimony
of Blanco and the inadmissible confessions presented to support him have not
established the proof beyond reasonable doubt required to overcome the
presumption that the defendants are not guilty.  In the eyes of the law, they must be declared innocent because
the contrary has not been proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whoever killed that little boy deserves the strongest
condemnation and punishment, but these must come from another Court still
higher than this one.  Lacking its
infallible and omniscient certainty, we, as mortal judges going only by the
evidence at hand, can convict only if the bloodied hand is bared beyond the
whisper of a doubt.</p>
