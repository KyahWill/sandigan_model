<p>This is one of the many unfortunate cases where a dispute over property 
rights has marred the amity that should characterize the Filipino family, which 
the Constitution seeks to strengthen as a basic social institution.&nbsp; 
Regrettably, the adage that blood is thicker than water is not always true.&nbsp; 
There are times when that amalgam is diluted and so enervated by the venom of 
misunderstanding, if not cupidity, turning affectionate siblings into hostile 
strangers.&nbsp; Rejected then are memories of a more amiable past when they sat 
together as children at the foot of a common parent, learning tender lessons of 
selflessness and sharing.<br><br>This particular case arose from a complaint for 
partition of a 3-hectare parcel of unregistered land in Talisay, Batangas, filed 
in 1973 by the herein respondents against their sister and her husband, the 
present petitioners.&nbsp; At the pre-trial conference, the parties stipulated that 
they were the sole heirs of their mother, Teofila Manimtim, who died on November 
7, 1923, without a will; that the said land was sold by her two days before her 
death with right of repurchase within seven years; that the defendants redeemed 
the said property on July 23, 1930; that the tax declaration on the land in 
favor of Teofila Manimtim was then canceled and another one was issued in the 
name of Francisco P. de Guzman; and that since then the real estate taxes 
thereon had been paid by the defendants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> On the basis of this stipulation of facts, 
the following issues were submitted by the parties for resolution by the trial 
court:</p>
<ol><li>Whether under the deed of repurchase, the ownership of the land in dispute 
was vested in the defendants or in all the heirs of the deceased Teofila 
Manimtim; and<br><br></li><li>Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the repurchase by the defendants was made 
for and in behalf of all the heirs, whether or not, as alleged by defendants, 
they became the owners of the property by virtue of prescription through 
adverse, actual, continuous, public and exclusive possession and cultivation and 
whether or not, as alleged by defendants, plaintiffs are guilty of laches and 
estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></li></ol>
<p>At the trial, the plaintiffs waived the presentation of their evidence in 
chief, relying on the stipulation of facts, but later called rebuttal 
witnesses.&nbsp; The defendants, for their part, sought to prove that the land had 
been resold to them exclusively and that in any event they had acquired 
ownership over it under the rules of prescription, laches and estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In its decision of December 11, 
1974, the trial court held that the repurchase could not have been made by the 
defendants by themselves alone because the right belonged in common to the heirs 
of Teofila Manimtim.&nbsp; This was true even if it were assumed that the vendee<em> 
a retro</em> had intended to sell back the land to the defendants only, as the 
repurchase was subject to the limitations of the Civil Code and the stipulations 
in the original contract.&nbsp; Possession as a fact was not held exclusively by the 
defendant spouses but shared with Antonio M. Austria, who remained in the 
disputed land until 1971.&nbsp; As for the tax declarations in the name of the 
defendants, these could not be considered proof of ownership or, indeed, even of 
adverse possession.&nbsp; The trial court ruled that the cases invoked by the 
defendants, to wit, <em>Ecal v. Ecal</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <em>Director of Lands v. Abantao</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>, and <em>Austria v. Laurel</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> were not applicable because of certain 
factual and legal differences.<br><br>Appealed to the Court of Appeals, the said 
decision was affirmed <em>in toto</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
on September 29, 1977, and the motion for reconsideration was denied in a 
resolution dated November 22, 1977. The petitioners are now before us on 
<em>certiorari</em>.<br><br>In their first assignment of error, the petitioners 
fault the trial court for having allowed amendment of the complaint that they 
claim changed the theory of the case after the answer had been filed.&nbsp; We see no 
such change.&nbsp; The amendment was subject to the discretion of the court and this 
discretion was not abused or improperly exercised because the amendment did not 
change the plaintiffs' original posture.&nbsp; Their basic theory was that they were 
co-owners of the land in dispute, which was in fact the reason they had filed 
their complaint for its partition.&nbsp; This theory was not substantially altered by 
the amendment, which added to the original allegation that one of the plaintiffs 
administered, cultivated and developed the property.&nbsp; They had never originally 
asserted that the defendants were in exclusive possession of the disputed land, 
and the amendment did not so aver.<br><br>It was not necessary for the 
respondents to prove at the trial that they were entitled to the partition of 
the disputed property as co-owners thereof by right of intestate succession.&nbsp; 
The reason is that these matters were already covered by the above-mentioned 
stipulation of facts.&nbsp; The respondents were willing to submit the issue for 
resolution by the trial court without presentation of further proof.&nbsp; The 
stipulated facts were already deemed admitted by the parties.<br><br>The trial 
court was also correct in holding that the repurchase of the land in 1930 was 
subject to the specified condition of the pacto de retro concluded in 1923, to 
wit, that the repurchase was to be made by the vendor or her successors.&nbsp; 
Obviously, petitioner Mercedes de Guzman was not the only successor, and her 
husband was not even an heir, of Teofila Manimtim.&nbsp; A sale during the period of 
redemption to any other person other than the heirs of the deceased mother, as 
co-owners of the subject land, could not have been made by the vendee <em>a 
retro</em>.&nbsp; Any of the co-owners could have successfully invalidated such a 
transaction.<br><br>Concerning the petitioners' third assignment of error, we 
cannot over-emphasize the principle that this Court is not a trier of facts.&nbsp; We 
review the factual findings of the lower courts only when there appears to be a 
grave abuse of discretion or it is shown that they are not supported by 
substantial evidence.&nbsp; We do not find such a flaw in this case.&nbsp; On the 
contrary, we note from the decision of the trial court, which the respondent 
Court of Appeals has affirmed, that there was ample evidence of the petitioners 
asserting an adverse and exclusive claim of ownership over the disputed land 
only from 1973.&nbsp; Before that date, they had acknowledged, expressly and tacitly, 
the rights of the private respondents as co-owners of the land in 
question.<br><br>The petitioners' claim of acquisitive prescription by reason of 
uninterrupted and adverse possession since 1930, or for 43 years, must be 
rejected.&nbsp; Significantly, the petitioners make much of one of the respondent's 
statement that they overdid Rip Van Winkle, "because Rip Van Winkle slept only 
for twenty years x x x but we slept for forty-three years," which they quote 
from the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> To say the least, we 
find it censurable, as smacking of bad faith, that they did not, in fairness, 
continue with the immediately succeeding sentence.&nbsp; The next statement read:&nbsp; 
"But we admit that we slept on the land, not outside the land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Such suppression of a very meaningful 
qualification sharpens the contrast between the credibilities of the parties and 
further weakens the petitioners' case against the respondents.<br><br>Article 
494 of the Civil Code provides that prescription does not run against a co-owner 
"so long as he expressly or impliedly recognizes the co-ownership." As the 
adverse claim in this case was found by the trial court to have been made by the 
petitioners only in May 1973, no acquisitive prescriptive rights had as yet 
attached to the petitioners when the complaint for partition was filed against 
them in June 1973.&nbsp; By the same token, laches or estoppel cannot be invoked 
against the private respondents because they were not sleeping on their rights 
as long as the co-ownership continued to be recognized by the herein 
petitioners.&nbsp; To quote from one of the respondents:</p>
<blockquote>"We, the plaintiffs (private respondents) in this case are prepared 
to admit that we slept like Rip Van Winkle as Atty. Amador Roxas said, and we 
admit that we even overdid Rip Van Winkle because Rip Van Winkle slept only for 
twenty (20) years x x x but we slept for forty-three years.&nbsp; <em>But we admit 
that we slept on the land, not outside the land</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Elaborating, he declared:</p>
<blockquote>"We merely followed the custom of the people among brothers and 
sisters.&nbsp; It is not usual to mistrust each other.&nbsp; That is the meaning of the 
statement that I made when I said it is true we slept, but it is not the sleep 
that is understood by the defendants (petitioners herein).&nbsp; We slept because we 
knew all along that the defendants (petitioners) would not cheat us, would not 
deny us our right with respect to the land, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>
<p>In <em>Ecal v. Ecal</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the 
Court of Appeals held through then Asssociate Justice Fred Ruiz Castro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Under Article 1514 of the old Civil Code and Article 1612 of the new Civil 
Code, 'if several persons, jointly and in the same contract should sell an 
undivided immovable with the right to repurchase, none of them may exercise this 
right for more than his respective share.&nbsp; The same rule applies if the person 
who sold immovable alone has left several heirs, in which case each of the 
latter may only redeem the part which he may have acquired.’&nbsp; Should one of the 
co-owners or co-heirs succeed in alone redeeming the whole property, such 
co-owner or co-heir shall be considered as a mere trustee with respect to the 
shares of his co-owners or co-heirs; accordingly, no prescription will lie 
against the right of any co-owner or co-heir to demand from the redemptioner his 
respective share in the property redeemed, which share is subject of course to a 
lien in favor of the redemptioner for the amount paid by him corresponding to 
the value of the share."</p></blockquote>
<p>The applicable provision was Article 1514 of the old Civil Code, which was 
reproduced <em>verbatim</em> in the new Civil Code as Article 1612, reading as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"Art. 1612.&nbsp; If several persons, jointly and in the same contract, 
should sell an undivided immovable with a right of repurchase, none of them may 
exercise this right for more than his respective share.<br><br>"The same rule 
shall apply if the person who sold an immovable alone has left several heirs, in 
which case each of the latter may only redeem the part which he may have 
acquired."</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing in the above provision suggesting that it is applicable only 
to registered land and does not cover unregistered land like the property in 
question.&nbsp; Obviously, we cannot read any distinction into the law where it is 
not obvious or even obviously intended.&nbsp; In fact, the private respondents' case 
is even stronger than in Ecal because the redemptioner there repurchased the 
property in his own right.&nbsp; In this case, there is the express admission from 
petitioner Mercedes de Guzman that she was repurchasing the property in question 
not for herself alone but for the other co-owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Abantao case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> also invoked by the petitioners, is not 
applicable because the factual antecedents are different.&nbsp; There was no exercise 
in that case of the right of repurchase by one co-owner that inured to the 
advantage of the other co-owners because the period for the redemption of the 
property after it had been acquired by the government at a tax sale had already 
expired.&nbsp; Indeed, it was only after twelve years that one of the heirs offered 
to, and actually did, buy back the property from the government.&nbsp; She did so, 
however, in her own personal capacity and not by virtue of a right of 
redemption, and certainly not as a co-owner.&nbsp; In the instant case, it has been 
established that Mercedes de Guzman exercised the right of repurchase during the 
stipulated period of seven years and in her capacity as a co-owner.<br><br>The 
case of <em>Austria v. Laurel</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
is also not in point because although there was here a categorical rejection by 
the defendant of the plaintiff's claim of ownership, the latter took all of 
<em>seventeen years</em> to assert his right, By contrast, the petitioners in 
the instant case, according to the evidence adduced, asserted their exclusive 
claim of ownership only in May 1973, or barely a month before the partition case 
was instituted by the private respondents.<br><br>There are abundant authorities 
to support the holding of the court <em>a quo</em> that tax declarations are not 
conclusive evidence of ownership or even claims of adverse possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> While it was not denied that the 
petitioners paid the real estate taxes on the land, the payment came presumably 
from the fruits thereof, which they occasionally shared with the private 
respondents.&nbsp; Significantly, it was also established that respondent Austria 
stayed in the disputed land for many years and enjoyed some of its proceeds as a 
matter of right and not by tolerance or charity on the part of the 
petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>We are satisfied 
with the factual findings of the trial judge, as affirmed by the Court of 
Appeals, and see no reason for disturbing them.&nbsp; We also sustain the legal 
conclusions of the respondent court as a correct interpretation and application 
of the pertinent law and jurisprudence.<br><br>What we see here is a deplorable 
attempt on the part of the petitioners to deprive the private respondents of 
their lawful shares in the property derived by them from their mother, and 
through a method hardly worthy of a sister.&nbsp; The argument that the private 
respondents have by their neglect forfeited whatever rights they might have had 
— feeble enough as it is — becomes all the more unseemly among members of the 
same family, where love normally takes precedence over law.&nbsp; We are saddened by 
this regrettable case but, even so, are gratified by the results we reach 
today.&nbsp; Happily, it proves once again that this is a Court not only of law but 
also of justice.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appealed decision is 
affirmed in toto, with costs against the petitioners.<br><br><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.</p>
