				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal by accused Carlito Tala alias "Boy" from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated September 7, 1988 of the Regional Trial Court of Guagua, Pampanga, Third Judicial Region, Branch 51 in Criminal Case No. G-1627, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"Finding that the evidence has reached a degree of moral certainty that all the elements of robbery with homicide were adequately proven the three accused Tolentino, Matawaran and Tala should be found guilty of the crime charged. The Court also finds that the prosecution has proven actual damages consisting in the amount of P60,000.00 as hospital and medical expenses and P30,000.00 as funeral expenses or a total of P90,000.00.

However, during the initial hearing of this case, accused Manolito Tolentino changed his plea from "Not Guilty" to "Guilty" in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The facts as found by the trial court are as follows:<br><br>At around 7 p.m. of November 7, 1983, Adelaida Lingad left her niece, Grace Paule and her three (3) children namely: Geraldine (Irene), Glenly and Enrique, all minors, at home to attend the wake of her uncle in a house 200 meters away from her place. The children were the only ones left at home. Her husband was then working abroad. At that time, Adelaida had P4,000.00 in cash which was wrapped in newspaper and kept hidden under her bed. Before leaving the house, Adelaida instructed the kids to go to bed.<br><br>At around 1 p.m. or 2 p.m. of November 8, 1983, accused Tala, Tolentino, Matawaran and an unknown person whose face was covered entered the house of Adelaida Lingad by forcibly breaking the window grill of the comfort room and demanded to know from the children where their mother hid her money. Grace Paule knew Manolito Tolentino because he is both an uncle and a barriomate. She also knew Carlito Tala who is a relative of her mother and Rodolfo Matawaran who is a "barkada" of Carlito. She recognized all the accused for the lights were on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> When the man whose face was covered threaten to stab the kids, Geraldine got so frighten that she revealed to the accused where her mother hid the money.<br><br>After Tolentino took the P4,000.00, he stabbed Grace Paule with a scythe while the other three (3) accused held the three (3) other children who were then stabbed one after the other by Tolentino. During the stabbing incident, Grace Paule lost consciousness but was able to regain it back after about five (5) minutes and shouted for help. Her mother and grandmother, who lived nearby, heard her and immediately proceeded to said house but the four (4) accused had already left.<br><br>When accused Tolentino's brother informed Adelaida about the stabbing incident that took place in her house, Adelaida immediately rushed to her house and saw all the children with stab wounds. Glenly was lying on the bed already dead while her bloodied niece Grace was sitting down near the door looking pale and holding her heart. Upon reaching Geraldine, who was lying at the porch, she asked her the identities of the person responsible for stabbing them with the latter answering "Bong-Bong" and also mentioning the names of Tala and Matawaran<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>. However, when she asked her son Enrique the latter was not able to answer but merely made a sign with his three (3) fingers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>. Thereafter, Adelaida lost consciousness and was brought to the house of her mother.<br><br>Upon reporting said incident to the authorities, Adelaida together with three (3) policemen went back to her house and an investigation was conducted where it was discovered that the accused entered into the house by destroying the middle portion of the wooden bars of the comfort room.<br><br>Meanwhile, the children were brought to the Central Luzon General Hospital where Glenly was pronounced dead on arrival and Enrique eventually died after undergoing an unsuccessful surgery. Geraldine who was operated twice at the Makabali Hospital also succumbed to her untimely death.<br><br>Grace Paule was the only surviving victim of this horrible and harrowing experience and testified that she was awaken by the four (4) accused who entered the house of her aunt in the early morning of November 8, 1983 and subsequently stabbed her and her three (3) cousins. She positively identified the three (3) accused because accused Manolito Tolentino is her uncle as well as her barriomate and accused-appellant Carlito Tala is a relative of her mother while accused Rodolfo Matawaran is the "barkada" of accused-appellant Tala.<br><br>On the otherhand, accused-appellant Tala denied having been in the house of Adelaida Lingad on that fateful morning and maintained that at around 11 p.m. of November 7, 1983, he and accused Matawaran were delivering watermelons at Saging, Dinalupihan, Bataan. Thereafter, they went to Samal to return the trailer where the watermelons were loaded and proceeded to his house in Lourdes, Lubao, Pampanga. On their way home, they passed the house of Adelaida Lingad and noticed nothing unusual. They arrived at his house at around 3 a.m. of November 8, 1983 and slept there.<br><br>In rejecting the defense of alibi, the trial court correctly stated as follows:<br><blockquote>"Inasmuch as the two accused, Tala and Matawaran, were riding in a jeep and the scene of occurrence is only a 30 minutes drive from their place of destination, which is Dinalupihan, Bataan, it is [still] possible for them to reach their alleged destination and come back to Lourdes, Lubao, Pampanga in time to participate in the commission of the offense. Their painful and laborious effort to extend the period of time especially the three hours to load the watermelons is pitiful in its incredibility. The indubitable fact remains that despite all allegations alleging alibi the accused Tala and Matawaran slept in Lourdes, Lubao and were in fact apprehended there.<br><br>"It must be noted that the alibi in order to be given full faith and credit must be clearly established and must not leave any room for doubt as to its plausibility and verity.<br><br>"In order that alibi as a defense may prosper, the evidence to support it must be clear and convincing as to preclude the possibility of the accused's presence at the scene of the crime while the evidence as to his identification must be weak and insufficient.<br><br>"Foremost and above all, it is essential that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive testimony of a witness who clearly identified them as two of the cohorts of Manolito Tolentino.<br><br>"It is clear that in this case that the accused Tala and Matawaran failed to establish the credibility of their defense of alibi, first, as the facts narrated by them were not clear and convincing, second, there exist a wide room for doubt as to the plausity and verity of their testimonies, and finally, their defense of alibi is belied by the positive identification made by Grace Paule."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Resolving the arguments of accused-appellant Tala that no probative value should be given to the extrajudicial statement of Grace Paule taken by Fiscal Abiog while she was still staying at the Makabili Hospital, since his name and that of accused Matawaran were not mentioned by her as the unnamed companion of accused Tolentino, thereby indicating that the witness really had no inkling as to his participation in said crime until Mang Medrano supplied her their names, does not convince Us of the want of probative value of said statement of Grace Paule.<br><br>True that Grace failed to mention the names of accused-appellant Tala and accused Matawaran in her extrajudicial statement, but considering the fact that at the time her statement was taken she was then groggy and delirious from the stab wound she sustained but was nevertheless, able to positively identify accused-appellant on the witness stand as one of the persons who stabbed her and the children. We find Grace's testimony credible. There is no evidence on record to show why said witness would falsely implicate accused­-appellant Tala who is a relative of her mother unless it is the truth. There being no improper motive on her part to point to accused-appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime charged, Grace's testimony is entitled to full faith and credit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>. Moreover, her testimony was corroborated by prosecution witness Adelaida Lingad when the latter testified that her deceased daughter Geraldine mentioned the names of the accused-appellant Tala and accused Matawaran as the persons who stabbed her before she died.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>As to accused-appellant's contention that the statement of Geraldine, naming her assailant soon after she was stabbed is inadmissible as part of the <i>res gestae.</i> We find said contention fallacious. The testimony of Adelaida Lingad, as mother of the victims belied the accused-appellant's allegation:&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="13%"><div align="LEFT">"Fiscal Abiog:</div></th><td width="87%"><div align="LEFT"></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">May I make it of record that all these three accused were properly or positively identified by the witness.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Now, Mrs. Witness, when we initially hear this case, you testified that you asked Geraldine who was then at the porch, you asked her as to who stabbed or caused those stabbed wounds and you testified that she told you she was stabbed by a certain Bong-Bong.
