<p class="BODY">On August 1, 1983, at about 2:00 a.m., a fire broke out heavily
damaging petitioner's building.  Several
machineries, equipments and materials of private respondent company therein
were also heavily damaged and/or destroyed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 24, 1983, petitioner filed a case for damages with
preliminary attachment against Chromecraft<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> and

<p class="BODY">In all these three cases, the allegations in petitioner's
complaints are substantially the same, especially the allegation on the
proximate cause of the fire,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> to
wit:  "x x x the negligence of
defendants' domestics and/or employees, some of whom were staying inside the
leased premises and were present during the fire, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">by </span>storing within the leased premises flammable materials, in
gross violation of the lease agreement, and by failing to put up and/or install
the proper safeguards and equipments to prevent the occurrence of fire
therein." In the present case, petitioner claimed that it suffered damages
in the amount of P415,584.00 representing actual damages and P83,116.80 for
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Traversing the allegations in the complaint, private respondents,
in their answer with compulsory counterclaims, alleged that the fire started
somewhere else and not in the premises leased <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">by </span>them and that they have not done any act or omission which,
factually or legally, renders them answerable for the fire and/or the resulting
damages.  They interposed counterclaims
for P1,300,000.00 as actual damages due to the malicious filing by petitioner
of the complaint; P2,000,000.00 for moral damages; P50,000.00 for exemplary
damages and P100,000.00 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, at the inception of this case, was able to obtain a
writ of preliminary attachment on the properties of private respondent company
upon the filing of a bond furnished <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>Visayan
Surety and Insurance Corporation in the sum of P498,700.80, all done <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ex-parte</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

The Sheriff was able to attach private respondents' properties still located
inside the burnt building as well as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on </span>the
proceeds of the insurance claim, upon the request of petitioner.  However, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

discharging the attachment upon private respondents' filing of a counterbond in
the amount of P498,700.00 furnished by Prudential Guarantee and Assurance,
Inc., the properties attached were released on November 10, 1983.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with said decision, both parties appealed before
public respondent Court of Appeals.  On
March 18, 1991, respondent court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion
of which reads:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assigns the following relevant errors committed by
respondent court:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

formally offered by private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">respondents,
consisting </span>of mere <u>xerox</u> copies of documents purportedly marked
during the trial without proper comparison and verification that the <u>xerox</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">copies are </span>faithful
reproductions of the exhibits so marked, despite seasonable objection thereto;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)  In considering the
action as based on tort and not on breach of lease contracts;</blockquote>

reliance on the investigation reports of the police (Exh. "24") and
the insurance adjuster (Exh. "21");</blockquote>

testimonies of Marcelo Salatan, Eddie Luspo and Ricardo S. Tantongco are not
credible;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5)  In not finding any
significance to the unusually high fire insurance coverage of P6 million
procured by private respondent company; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>6)  That its monetary award
in favor of private respondent company lacks factual and legal bases.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioner asseverates that what private
respondents formally offered, as Exhibits "9" to "12" and
"15" to "51," with submarkings, were mere xerox copies of
documents purporting to have been marked as exhibits in the course of the
trial.  Prior to such offer, no
comparison was made between the documents purportedly marked as exhibits and
the alleged xerox copies thereof, to establish their faithful reproduction;
that the cause of action against private respondents was founded on breach of
lease contracts rather than on tort; that the police and insurance adjuster's
reports are hearsay because their findings, insofar as the origin and cause of
the fire are concerned, did not stem from personal knowledge but on information
from other persons who were not called to the witness stand; and that the
respondent court's finding that the testimonies of Marcelo Salatan, Eddie Luspo
and Ricardo Tantongco, its President and General Manager, are not credible,
following the finding of Judge Tomas V. Tadeo who penned the decision but who
did not hear the testimonies of these witnesses, is unfounded and springs from
a gross misapprehension of the totality of their respective testimonies.  Private respondent company, whose paid-up
capital is only P62,500.00, procured an unusually high fire insurance coverage
of P6,000,000.00 over the personal properties supposedly found inside the
leased premises.  Lastly, the grant of
damages to private respondents is bereft of any factual or legal basis, and
contravenes well-settled jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The voluminous pleadings filed in this case notwithstanding, this
Court finds no reversible error in the decision of respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised by petitioner involve factual matters and the
rule <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>this jurisdiction as
held in <i>Remalante v.

Petitioner's case, however, does not fall under any of these exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court's ratiocination, being anchored on factual
and legal grounds, deserves Our affirmance.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to petitioner's first assignment of errors, while
Exhibits "9," "10" and "11" (which are copies of
the complaint filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>petitioner
against Chromecraft and Perflex, and a copy of the amended complaint filed
against the latter) are mere xerox copies, respondent court noted that relevant
portions of said exhibits were read in evidence from certified true copies of
the aforementioned complaints.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to Exhibit "12" (the lay-out of the premises leased
by private respondents which was sketched by insurance adjuster Victor Mariñas
and on which were indicated the locations of the knitting machines in the burnt
premises), the same had been sufficiently established in the testimony of
Mariñas.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
what is important are the nature and value of the stocks transferred to the
additional leased premises as testified to by Mariñas.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Exhibits "18" and "19" (which refer to items
evidenced <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>invoices but which
were burnt in the premises of private respondent company) were also identified
and testified to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>Mariñas.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

And so with Exhibits "18" to "23," which were offered to
prove that there was no over-insurance by private respondent company.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Exhibit "24" (the final investigation report of the
Anti-Arson Composite Team, FD 11, Northern Police District) which is also
Exhibit "HH" for petitioner was identified by witness Arturo Martin
(who is a signatory to such exhibit) as a xerox copy of the original brought by
him to the Regional Trial Court (Branch 85) of Quezon City in the course of his
testimony in said court in a complaint filed by the former in connection with
the same fire incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Exhibits "25" to "46," these were
offered merely to show that there were deliveries of supplies and equipments
immediately before the fire as testified to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">by </span>witness Timothy Ang.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibits "47" to "50" refer to firm offers
and corresponding cancellations made as the basis for private respondents'
demand for actual and consequential damages.  These exhibits were identified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by
</span>Timothy Ang in the hearing of April 8, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit "51" (the retainer agreement) was also
identified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>Ang in the course
of his testimony on April 8, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, as correctly held by respondent court,
the first assignment of error would not help the cause of petitioner even if it
were resolved in its favor.  Moreover,
its objection is purely technical.  It
failed to show any discrepancy between the exhibits marked during the trial and
those offered in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the second, third, fourth and fifth assigned
errors, again, respondent court correctly ruled on these issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner attempted to prove private respondent company's negligence
with evidence to the effect that two days before the fire, Ricardo Tantongco
saw flammable materials in the leased premises after he was informed earlier by
his construction workers, namely, Marcelo Salatan and Eddie Luspo, of its
presence in said premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Salatan's testimony, however, is not credible for a good number
of reasons.  In one instance, he was
caught lying regarding his previous claim that he was not investigated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>anybody regarding the fire.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

cause and/or origin</u> broke out at the Production Section of Perflex Mfg. Co.
Ltd. located at the ground floor.</blockquote>

extensive damage brought about by the fire.  However, ashes and debris were collected at the scene and were forwarded
to the PC Crime Laboratory for examination, the result of which was <u>negative
for inflammable substance</u>, thereby ruling out incendiarism.  Insurance coverage of these establishments
shows that it is not enough to cover up their actual total damages brought
about by this fire.  With this findings,
it is honestly believed that the cause of fire was purely accidental."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The said report had been assailed as hearsay for the reason that
the supporting affidavits and documents on which such report was based had not
been attached thereto.  But the report
was submitted by government officials and personnel, with expertise in the line
of work they are doing, to investigate and report on the cause of the
fire.  Their findings and conclusions
warrant the presumption of regularity and correctness.  If petitioner believed that the conclusions
contained in the report is not true, then it is incumbent upon petitioner to
prove the contrary.  The report as well
as the supporting affidavits are available for inspection and perusal.  It could have compelled the production of
the same and proved its suspicions before the trial court.  These, petitioners failed to do.  In fact Ricardo Tantongco's failure to
contact the arson investigators and inform them of the flammable materials that
he allegedly saw in the premises burned two days before the fire is incomprehensible.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the award of damages by respondent court subject
of the sixth and seventh assigned errors, We find the same proper.  It took into account the following
actuations of petitioner, through Ricardo Tantongco, as indications of
recklessness, insincerity, malice, oppression, and wanton bad faith in the
filing of its complaint in that -</p>

<p class="BODY">1. He knew that an investigation was conducted right after the
fire on the premises in question by the Anti-Arson Team of Quezon City Police
Department and yet he did nothing by way of cooperating in said
investigation.  He likewise knew that
the investigators found out that the fire did not originate from the place of
private respondents but from Perflex, that it was accidental, and that private
respondent company's employees had nothing to do at all with the cause of the
fire.  The insurance adjuster also
arrived at the same findings.  In spite
of all these, petitioner still filed the complaint; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2. He filed similar cases against Perflex and Chromecraft in
support of petitioner's allegation that the proximate cause of the fire is the
negligence of the domestics/employees of each defendant in each case.</p>
