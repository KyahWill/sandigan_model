which there does not appear to be any dispute, <span style="">to </span>wit:</p>

<blockquote>"From the pleadings and supporting documents before the Court,
it can be gathered that on March 22, 1990, 1st Lt. Absalon V. Salboro of the
CAPCOM Northern Sector (now Central Sector) filed with the Regional Trial Court
of Kalookan City an application for search warrant.  The search warrant was sought for in connection with an alleged
violation of P.D. 1866 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunitions)
perpetrated at No. 25 Newport St., corner Marlboro St., Fairview, Quezon
City.  <span style="">On </span>March 23, 1990, respondent RTC Judge of Kalookan City issued
Search Warrant No. 95-90.  On the same
day, at around 2:30 p.m., members of the CAPCOM, armed with subject search
warrant, proceeded to the situs of the offense alluded to, where a labor
seminar of the Ecumenical Institute for Labor Education and Research (EILER)
was then taking place.  According to
CAPCOM's 'Inventory of Property Seized,' firearms, explosive materials and subversive
documents, among others, were seized and taken during the search.  And all the sixty-one (61) persons found
within the premises searched were brought to Camp Karingal, Quezon City but
most of them were later released, with the exception of the herein petitioners,
EILER Instructors, who were indicted for <span style="">violation
</span>of P.D. 1866 in Criminal Case No. Q-90-11757 before Branch 88 of the
Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, presided over by respondent Judge Tirso
D.C. Velasco.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On July 10, 1990, petitioners presented a 'Motion for
Consolidation, Quashal of Search Warrant and For the Suppression of All
Illegally Acquired Evidence' before the Quezon City court; and a 'Supplemental
Motion to the Motion for Consolidation, Quashal of Search Warrant and Exclusion
of Evidence Illegally Obtained'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On September 21, 1990, the respondent Quezon City Judge
issued the challenged order, consolidating subject cases but denying the prayer
for the quashal of the search warrant under attack, the validity of which
warrant was upheld; opining that the same falls under the category of Writs and
Processes, within the contemplation of paragraph 3(b) of the Interim Rules and
Guidelines, and can be served not only within the territorial jurisdiction of
the issuing court but anywhere in the judicial region of the issuing court
(National Capital Judicial Region); x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the said Order
under challenge, having been denied by the assailed Order of October 5, 1990,
petitioners have come to this Court <i><span style="">via</span></i><span style=""> </span>the instant petition, raising the
sole issue:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'WHETHER OR NOT A COURT MAY TAKE COGNIZANCE OF AN APPLICATION FOR A

TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION AND TO ISSUE A WARRANT TO CONDUCT A SEARCH ON A PLACE
LIKEWISE OUTSIDE ITS TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.â€™"</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals rendered judgment,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in effect affirming that of the trial court, by denying due course to the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and lifting the temporary restraining order it
had issued on November 29, 1990 in connection therewith.  This judgment of respondent court is now
impugned in and sought to be reversed through the present recourse before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not favorably impressed by the arguments adduced by petitioners
in support of their submissions.  Their
disquisitions postulate interpretative theories contrary to the letter and
intent of the rules on search warrants and which could pose legal obstacles, if
not dangerous doctrines, in the area of law enforcement.  Further, they<span style=""> fail to validly distinguish, hence they do not convincingly delineate
the difference, between the matter of (1) the court which has the competence to
issue a search warrant under a given set of facts, and (2) the permissible
jurisdictional range in the enforcement of such search warrant <i>vis-a-vis</i>
the court's territorial jurisdiction.  These issues while effectively cognate are essentially discrete since
the resolution of one does not necessarily affect or preempt the other.  Accordingly, to avoid compounding the
seeming confusion, these questions shall be discussed <i>seriatim</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners invoke the jurisdictional rules in the institution of
criminal actions to invalidate the search warrant issued by the Regional Trial
Court of Kalookan City because it is directed toward the seizure of firearms
and ammunition allegedly cached illegally in Quezon City.  This theory is sought to be buttressed by
the fact that the criminal case against petitioners for violation of
Presidential Decree No. 1866 was subsequently filed in the latter court.  The application for the search warrant, it
is claimed, was accordingly filed in a court of improper venue and since venue
in criminal actions involves the territorial jurisdiction of the court, such
warrant is void for having been issued by a court without jurisdiction to do
so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic flaw in this reasoning is in erroneously equating the
application for and the obtention of a search warrant with the institution and
prosecution of a criminal <span style="">action in a
trial court.  It would thus categorize
what is only a special criminal </span><i>process</i>, <span style="">the power to issue which </span>is <span style="">inherent in </span><i>all</i> <span style="">courts,
as equivalent to a criminal </span><i>action</i>, <span style="">jurisdiction over which is reposed in </span><i>specific</i> <span style="">courts of indicated competence.  It ignores the fact that the requisites,
procedure and purpose for the issuance of a search warrant are completely
different from those for the institution of a criminal action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For, indeed, a warrant,
such </span>as <span style="">a warrant of arrest or a
search warrant, merely constitutes process.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">A search warrant is defined in our

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In American
jurisdictions, from which we have taken our jural concept and provisions on

considered merely as a process, generally issued by a court in the exercise of

court pursuant to its original jurisdiction.  We emphasize <span style="">this fact for
purposes of both issues as formulated in this opinion, with the catalogue of
authorities herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Invariably, a judicial
process is defined as a writ, </span><i>warrant</i>, <span style="">subpoena, or other formal writing issued by authority of law; also the
means of accomplishing an end, including judicial proceedings,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

summons, or </span><i>order</i> <span style="">issued in
a judicial proceeding to acquire jurisdiction of a person or his property, to

<p class="NUM">2. It is clear, therefore, that a search warrant is merely a
judicial process designed by the Rules to respond only to an incident in the
main case, if one has already been instituted, or in anticipation thereof.  In the latter contingency, as in the case at
bar, it would involve some judicial clairvoyance to require observance of the
rules as<span style=""> to where a criminal case may
eventually be filed where, in the first place, no such action having as yet
been instituted, it may ultimately be filed in a territorial jurisdiction other
than that wherein the illegal articles sought to be seized are then
located.  This is aside from the
consideration that a criminal action may be filed in different venues under the
rules for </span><i>delitos</i> <i>continuados</i> <span style="">or in those instances where different trial courts have concurrent
original jurisdiction over the same criminal offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In fact, to illustrate
the gravity of the problem which petitioners' implausible position may create,
we need not stray far from the provisions of Section 15, Rule 110 of the Rules
of Court on the venue of criminal actions and which we quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 15.  <i>Place
where action to be instituted</i>.  -</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subject to existing laws, in all criminal
prosecutions the action shall be instituted and tried in the court of the
municipality or territory wherein the offense was committed or any one of the
essential ingredients thereof took place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where an offense is committed on a railroad
train, in an aircraft, or any other public or private vehicle while in the
course of its trip, the criminal action may be instituted and tried in the
court of any municipality or territory where such train, aircraft or other
vehicle passed during such trip, including the place of departure and arrival.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where an offense is committed on board a vessel
in the course of its voyage, the criminal action may be instituted and tried in
the proper court of the first port of entry or of any municipality or territory
through which the vessel passed during such voyage, subject to the generally
accepted principles of international law.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other
crimes committed outside of the Philippines but punishable therein under
Article 2 of the Revised Penal Code shall be cognizable by the proper court in
which the charge is first filed.  (14a)"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It would be an exacting
imposition upon the law enforcement authorities or the prosecutorial agencies
to unerringly determine where they should apply for a search warrant in view of
the uncertainties and possibilities as to the ultimate venue of a case under
the foregoing rules.  It would be doubly
so if compliance with that requirement would be under pain of nullification of
said warrant should they file their application therefor in and obtain the same
from what may later turn out to be a court not within the ambit of the aforequoted
Section 15.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our Rules of Court,
whether of the 1940, 1964 or the present vintage, and, for that matter, the
Judiciary Act of </span>1948<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> or
the recent Judiciary Reorganization Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> have
never required the jurisdictional strictures that the petitionersâ€™ thesis would
<span style="">seek </span>to be inferentially drawn
from the silence of the reglementary provisions.  On the contrary, we are of the view that said statutory omission
was both deliberate and significant.  It
cannot but mean that the formulators of the Rules of Court, and even Congress
itself, did not consider it proper or correct, on considerations of national
policy and the pragmatics of experience, to clamp a legal manacle on those who
would ferret out the evidence of a crime.  For us to now impose such conditions or restrictions, under the guise of
judicial interpretation, may instead be reasonably construed as trenching on
judicial legislation.  It would be
tantamount to a judicial act of engrafting upon a law something that <span style="">has been omitted but which someone believes
ought to have been embraced therein.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Concededly, the problem
of venue would be relatively easier to resolve if a criminal case has already
been filed in a particular court and a search warrant is needed to secure
evidence to be presented therein.  Obviously,
the court trying the criminal case may properly issue the warrant, upon proper
application and due compliance with the requisites therefor, since such
application would only be an incident in that case and which it can resolve in
the exercise of its ancillary jurisdiction.  If the contraband articles are within its territorial jurisdiction,
there would appear to be no further complications.  The jurisdictional problem would resurrect, however, where such
articles are outside its territorial jurisdiction, which aspect will be
addressed hereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming back to the first
issue now under consideration, petitioners, after discoursing on the respective
territorial jurisdictions of the thirteen Regional Trial Courts which
correspond to the thirteen <span style="">judicial
regions,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">invite our attention to the fact that
this Court, pursuant to its authority granted by law,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">has defined the territorial
jurisdiction of each </span>branch of a Regional Trial Court<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
over which the particular branch concerned shall exercise its authority.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>From this, it is theorized that
"only the branch of a Regional Trial Court which has jurisdiction over the
place to be searched could grant an application for and issue a warrant to
search that place." Support for such position is sought to be drawn from
issuances of this Court, that is, Circular No. 13 issued on October 1, 1985, as
amended by Circular No. 19 on August 4, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reject that proposition.  Firstly, it is evident that both circulars were not intended to be of
general application to all instances involving search warrants and in all
courts as would be the case if they had been adopted as part of the Rules of
Court.  These circulars were issued by
the Court to meet a particular exigency, that is, as emergency guidelines on
applications for search warrants filed <i><span style="">only</span></i><span style=""> </span>in the courts of Metropolitan Manila
and other courts with multiple salas and <i><span style="">only</span></i><span style=""> </span>with
respect to violations of the Anti-Subversion Act, crimes against public order
under the Revised Penal Code, illegal possession of firearms and/or
ammunitions, and violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.  In other words, the aforesaid theory on the
court's jurisdiction to issue search warrants would not apply to <i><span style="">single</span></i><span style="">-<i>sala</i> <i>courts</i> </span>and <i><span style="">other</span></i><span style=""> <i>crimes</i>.  </span>Accordingly, the rule sought by
petitioners to be adopted by the Court would actually result in a bifurcated
procedure which would be vulnerable to legal and constitutional objections.</p>

<p class="BODY">For that matter, neither can we subscribe to petitionersâ€™
contention that Administrative Order No. 3 of this Court, supposedly
"defining the limits of the territorial jurisdiction of the Regional Trial
Courts," was the source of the <i>subject matter jurisdiction</i> of, as
distinguished from the <i>exercise of jurisdiction</i> by, the courts.  As earlier observed, this administrative
order was issued pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 of Batas Pambansa
Blg. 129, the pertinent portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 18.  <i>Authority
to define territory appurtenant to each branch</i>.  - The Supreme Court shall define the territory over which a <i>branch</i>
of the Regional Trial Court shall <i>exercise its authority</i>.  The territory thus defined shall be deemed
to be the territorial <i>area</i> of the <i>branch</i> concerned for purposes
of determining the venue of all <i>writs</i>, <i>proceedings</i> or <i>actions</i>,
whether civil or criminal, x x x." (Italics ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Jurisdiction is conferred by substantive law, in this case Batas
Pambansa Blg. 129, not by a procedural law and, much less, by an administrative
order or circular.  The jurisdiction
conferred by said Act on regional trial courts and their judges is basically <i>regional
in scope</i>.  Thus, Section 17 thereof
provides that "(e)very Regional Trial Judge shall be appointed to a <i>region</i>
which shall be his permanent station," and he "may be assigned by the
Supreme Court to any branch or city or municipality within the same <i>region</i>
as public interest may require, and such assignment shall not be deemed an
assignment to another station <span style="">x x </span>x"
which, otherwise, would necessitate a new appointment for the judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, Administrative Order No. 3 and, in like manner,
Circulars Nos. 13 and 19, did not <i>per</i> <i>se</i> confer jurisdiction on
the covered regional trial court or its branches, such that non-observance
thereof would nullify their judicial acts.  The administrative order merely defines the limits of the <i>administrative
area</i> within which a branch of the court may exercise its authority pursuant
to the jurisdiction conferred by Batas Pambansa Blg. 129.  The circulars only allocated to the three
executive judges the <i>administrative areas</i> for which they may
respectively issue search warrants under the special circumstance contemplated
therein, but likewise pursuant to the <i>jurisdiction</i> vested in them by
Batas Pambansa Blg. 129.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, and more importantly, we definitely cannot accept the
conclusion that the grant of power to the courts mentioned therein, to
entertain and issue search warrants where the place to be searched is within
their territorial jurisdiction, was intended to exclude other courts from
exercising the same power.  It will
readily be noted that Circular No. 19 was basically intended to provide prompt
action on applications for search warrants.  Its predecessor, Administrative Circular No. 13, had a number of
requirements, principally a raffle <span style="">of </span>the
applications for search warrants, if they had been filed with the executive
judge, among the judges within his administrative area.  Circular No. 19 eliminated, by amendment,
that required raffle and ordered instead that such applications should
immediately be "taken cognizance of and acted upon by the <span style="">Executive Judges of the Regional Trial Court,
Metropolitan </span>Trial Court, and Municipal Trial Court under whose
jurisdiction the place to be searched is located," or by their substitutes
enumerated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evidently, that
particular provision of Circular No. 19 was never intended to confer exclusive
jurisdiction on said executive judges.  In view of the fact, however, that they were themselves directed to
personally act on the applications, instead of farming out the same among the
other judges as was the previous practice, it was but necessary and practical
to require them to so act only on</span> applications involving search of
places located within their respective territorial jurisdictions.  The phrase above quoted was, therefore, in
the nature of an allocation in the assignment of applications among them, in
recognition of human capabilities and limitations, and not a mandate for the
exclusion of all other courts.  In
truth, Administrative Circular No. 13 even specifically envisaged and
anticipated the non-exclusionary nature of that provision, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, in the implementation of the search
warrant properties are seized thereunder and the corresponding case is filed in
court, said case shall be distributed conformably with Circular No. 7 dated
September 23, 1974, of this Court, <i>and thereupon tried and decided by the
judge to whom it has been assigned, and not necessarily by the judge who issued
the search warrant</i>." (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>is, <span style="">therefore, incorrect to say that only the </span><i>court</i>
<span style="">which has jurisdiction over the
criminal case can issue the search warrant, as would be the consequence of
petitionersâ€™ position that only the </span><i>branch</i> <span style="">of the court with jurisdiction over the </span><i><span style="">place to be searched </span></i><span style="">can issue a warrant to search the same.  It may be conceded, as a matter of policy,
that where a criminal case is pending, the court wherein it was filed, or the
assigned branch thereof, has </span><i><span style="">primary</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">jurisdiction
to issue the search warrant; and where no such criminal case has yet been
filed, that the executive judges or their lawful substitutes in the areas and
for the offenses contemplated in Circular No. 19 shall have </span><i><span style="">primary </span></i>jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This should not, however,
mean that a court whose territorial jurisdiction does not embrace the place to
be searched cannot issue a search warrant therefor, where the obtention of that
search warrant is necessitated and justified by compelling considerations of
urgency, subject, time and place.  Conversely,
neither should a search warrant duly issued by a court which has jurisdiction
over a pending criminal case, or one issued by an executive judge or his lawful
substitute under the situations provided for by Circular No. 19, be denied
enforcement or nullified just because it was implemented outside the court's
territorial jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us, accordingly, to the second issue on the
permissible jurisdictional range of enforcement of search warrants.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stated </span><i><span style="">in limine</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">the affiliated issue
raised </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this case is whether a branch of a regional
trial court has </span>the authority to issue a warrant for the search of a
place outside its territorial jurisdiction.  Petitioners insistently answer the query in the negative.  We hold otherwise.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We repeat what we have
earlier stressed:  <i>No law or rule
imposes such a limitation on search warrants</i>, in the same manner that no
such restriction is provided for warrants of arrest.  Parenthetically, in certain states within the American
jurisdiction, there were limitations of the time wherein a warrant of arrest
could be enforced.  In <span style="">our jurisdiction, no period is provided for
the enforceability of warrants of arrest, and although within ten days from the
delivery of the warrant of arrest for execution a return thereon must be made
to the issuing judge,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> said warrant does not become <i>functus</i> <i>officio</i>
but is enforceable indefinitely until the same is enforced or recalled.  On the other hand, the lifetime of a search
warrant has been expressly set in our Rules at ten days</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">but
there is no provision as to the extent of the territory wherein it may be
enforced, provided it is implemented on and within the premises specifically

<blockquote><span style="">"3.  </span><i>Writs and processes</i>.  -</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(a)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]--><span style="">Writs of </span><i>certiorari,

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(b)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->All <i>other processes</i>, whether issued by a regional trial
court or a metropolitan trial court, municipal trial court or municipal circuit
trial court may be served <i>anywhere in the Philippines</i>, and, in the last
three cases, without a certification by the judge of the regional trial
court." (Italics ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We feel that the
foregoing provision </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">too clear to be further belabored or enmeshed
in unwarranted polemics.  The rule
enumerates the writs and processes which, even if issued by a regional trial
court, are enforceable only within its judicial region.  In contrast, it unqualifiedly provides that
all other writs and processes, regardless of which court issued the same, shall
be enforceable anywhere in the Philippines.  As earlier demonstrated, a search warrant is but a judicial process, not
a criminal action.  No legal provision,
statutory or reglementary, expressly or impliedly provides a jurisdictional or
territorial limit on its area of enforceability.  On </span>the contrary, <span style="">the
above-quoted provision of the interim Rules </span><i><span style="">expressly</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">authorizes its enforcement anywhere in the
country, since it is not among the processes specified in paragraph (a) and
there is no distinction or exception made regarding the processes contemplated
in paragraph (b).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but a necessary
and inevitable consequence of the nature and purpose of a search warrant.  The Court cannot be blind to the fact that
it is extremely difficult, as it undeniably is, to detect or elicit information
regarding the existence and location of illegally possessed or prohibited
articles.  The Court is accordingly
convinced that it should not make the requisites for the apprehension <span style="">of the culprits and the confiscation of such
illicit items, </span>once detected, more onerous if not impossible by imposing
further niceties of procedure or substantive rules of jurisdiction through
decisional dicta.  For that matter, we
are unaware of any instance wherein a search warrant was struck down on
objections based on territorial jurisdiction.  In the landmark case of <i><span style="">Stonehill,
et al. v</span>s. Diokno, </i><i><span style="">et al</span></i><span style="">.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> the
searches in the corporate offices in Manila and the residences in Makati of
therein petitioners were conducted pursuant to search warrants issued by the
Quezon City and Pasig branches of the Court of First Instance of Rizal and by
the Municipal Courts of Manila and Quezon City,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>but the same were never challenged on
jurisdictional grounds although they were subsequently nullified for being
general warrants.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A clarion call supposedly
of libertarian import is further sounded by petitioners, dubiously invoking the
<span style="">constitutional </span>proscription
against illegal searches and seizures.  We do not believe that the enforcement of a search warrant issued by a
court outside the territorial jurisdiction wherein the place to be searched is
located would create a constitutional question.  Nor are we swayed by the professed apprehension that the law
enforcement authorities may resort to what could be a permutation of forum
shopping, by filing an application for the warrant with a "friendly"
court.  It need merely be recalled that
a search warrant is only a process, not an action.  Furthermore, the constitutional mandate is translated into
specifically enumerated safeguards in Rule 126 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure for the issuance of a search warrant,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> and
all these have to be observed regardless of whatever court in whichever region <span style="">is </span>importuned for or actually issues a
search warrant.  Said requirements,
together with the ten-day lifetime of the warrant<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
would discourage resort to a court in another judicial region, not only because
of the distance but also the contingencies of travel and the danger involved,
unless there are really compelling reasons for the authorities to do so.  Besides, it does seem odd that such
constitutional protests have not been made against warrants of arrest which are
enforceable indefinitely and anywhere although they involve, not only property
and privacy, but persons and liberty.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it is a matter of judicial knowledge that the
authorities have to contend now and then with local and national criminal
syndicates of considerable power and influence, political or financial in
nature, and so pervasive as to render foolhardy any attempt to obtain a search
warrant in the very locale under their sphere of control.  Nor should we overlook the fact that to do
so will necessitate the transportation of applicantâ€™s witnesses to and their
examination in said places, with the attendant risk, danger and expense.  Also, a further well-founded precaution, obviously
born of experience and verifiable data, is articulated by the court <i>a</i> <i>quo</i>,
as quoted by respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>"This court is of the further belief that the possible leakage
of information which is of utmost importance in the issuance of a search
warrant is secured (against) where the issuing magistrate within the region
does not hold court sessions in the city or municipality, within the region,
where the place to be searched is located."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing situations may also have obtained and were taken
into account in the foreign judicial pronouncement that, <i>in the absence of
statutory restrictions</i>, a justice of the peace in one district of the
county may issue a search warrant to be served in another district of the
county and made returnable before the justice of still another district or another
court having jurisdiction to deal with the matters involved.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present state of our law on the matter, we find no such statutory
restrictions both with respect to the court which can issue the search warrant
and the enforcement thereof anywhere in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">Concern is expressed over possible conflicts of jurisdiction (or,
more accurately, in the <i>exercise</i> of jurisdiction) where the criminal
case is pending in one court and the search warrant is issued by another court
for the seizure of personal property intended to be used as evidence in said
criminal case.  This arrangement is not
unknown or without precedent in our jurisdiction.  In fact, as hereinbefore noted, this very situation was
anticipated in Circular No. 13 of this Court under the limited scenario
contemplated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, to put such presentiments to rest, we lay down the
following policy guidelines:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court wherein the
criminal case is pending shall have primary jurisdiction to issue search
warrants necessitated by and for purposes of said case.  An application for a search warrant may be
filed with another court only under extreme and compelling circumstances that
the applicant must prove to the satisfaction of the latter court which may or
may not give due course to the application depending on the validity of the
justification offered for not filing the same in the court with primary
jurisdiction thereover.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the latter court
issues the search warrant, a motion to quash the same may be filed in and shall
be resolved by said court, without prejudice to any proper recourse to the
appropriate higher court by the party aggrieved by the resolution of the
issuing court.  All grounds and
objections then available, existent or known shall be raised in the original or
subsequent proceedings for the quashal of the warrant, otherwise they shall be
deemed waived.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where no motion to quash
the search warrant was filed in or resolved by the issuing court, the
interested party may move in the court where the criminal case is pending for
the suppression as evidence of the personal property seized under the warrant
if the same is offered therein for said purpose.  Since two separate courts with different participations are
involved in this situation, a motion to quash a search warrant and a motion to
suppress evidence are alternative and not cumulative remedies.  In order to prevent forum shopping, a motion
to quash shall consequently be governed by the omnibus motion rule, provided, however,
that objections not available, existent or known during the proceedings for the
quashal of the warrant may be raised in the hearing of the motion to
suppress.  The resolution of the court
on the motion to suppress shall likewise be subject to any proper remedy in the
appropriate higher court.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the court which
issued the search warrant denies the motion to quash the same and is not
otherwise prevented from further proceeding thereon, all personal property
seized under the warrant shall forthwith be transmitted by it to the court wherein
the criminal case is pending, with the necessary safeguards and documentation
therefor.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These guidelines shall
likewise be observed where the same criminal offense is charged in different
informations or complaints and filed in two or more courts with concurrent
original jurisdiction over the criminal action.  Where the issue of which court will try the case shall have been
resolved, such court shall be considered as vested with primary jurisdiction to
act on applications for search warrants incident to the criminal case.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion enunciates these two principles:</p>

<blockquote>1.  Before the criminal action is filed with the
appropriate court, a court which has no territorial jurisdiction over the crime
may validly entertain an application for and thereafter issue a search warrant
in connection with the commission of such crime; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  After the filing of the criminal action, the
court with which it was filed has primary jurisdiction to issue search warrants
necessitated by and for purposes of said case; however, under extreme and
compelling circumstances, another court may issue a search warrant in
connection with said case.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">I <span style="">am
unable to agree with the first and with the exception to the second.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">A. By the very definition of a search warrant which the majority
opinion adopts, it is clear to me that only a court having territorial jurisdiction
over the crime committed can validly entertain an application for and issue a
search warrant in connection with said crime.  The majority opinion says:</p>

<blockquote>"For, indeed, a warrant, such as a warrant of arrest or a
search warrant, merely constitutes process.  A search warrant is defined in our jurisdiction as an order in writing
issued in the name of the People of the Philippines signed by a judge and
directed to a peace officer, commanding him to search for personal property and
bring it before the court.  A search
warrant is in the nature of a criminal process akin to a writ of
discovery.  It is a special and peculiar
remedy, drastic in nature, and made necessary because of a public necessity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In American jurisdictions, from which we have taken our jural
concept and provisions on search warrants, such warrant is definitively
considered merely as a process generally issued by a court in the exercise of
its ancillary jurisdiction, and not a criminal action to be entertained by a
court pursuant to its original jurisdiction.  We emphasize this fact for purposes of both issues as formulated in this
opinion, with the catalogue of authorities herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Invariably, a judicial process is defined as a writ, <i>warrant</i>,
subpoena, or other formal writing issued by authority of law; also the means of
accomplishing an end, including judicial proceedings, or all writs, <i>warrants</i>,
summonses, and <i>orders</i> of courts of justice or judicial officers.  It is likewise held to include a writ,
summons, or <i>order</i> in a judicial proceeding to acquire jurisdiction of a
person or his property, to expedite the cause or enforce judgment, or a writ, <i>warrant</i>,
mandate, or other processes issuing from a court of justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  It is clear, therefore, that a search
warrant is merely a judicial process designed by the Rules to respond only to
an incident in the main case, if one has already been instituted, or in
anticipation thereof..." (citations omitted)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">What
are to be underscored in the foregoing definition or disquisition on the
concept of a search warrant are the following:  (a) it is "in the nature of a criminal process akin to a writ of
discovery," (b) it is generally issued by a court "in the exercise of
its ancillary jurisdiction," and (c) it is "designed by the Rules to
respond only to an incident in the main case... or in anticipation
thereof." All of these are premised on the assumption that the court
entertaining the application for and issuing the search warrant has
jurisdiction over the main case, meaning, of course, the crime in connection
with whose commission the warrant was issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The writ of discovery is
the discovery in federal criminal cases governed by the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure.  Rule 16 thereof
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Upon motion of the defendant at any time after the filing of
the indictment or information, the court may order the attorney for the
government to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph designated
books, papers, documents or tangible objects, obtained from or belonging to the
defendant or obtained from others by seizure or process, upon a showing that
the items sought may be material to the presentation of his defense and that
the request is reasonable." (4 Federal Practice and Procedure with Forms,
Rules Edition, 1951 ed., 124).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Note that the required motion is filed <u><span style="">after</span></u><span style=""> </span>the filing of the indictment or information.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"Ancillary," in
reference to jurisdiction can only mean in aid of or incidental to an </span><u><span style="">original</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">jurisdiction.  Ancillary jurisdiction is defined as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<b>Ancillary jurisdiction</b>.  Power of court to adjudicate and determine matters incidental to
the exercise of its primary jurisdiction of an action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under 'ancillary jurisdiction doctrine' federal district court
acquires jurisdiction of case or controversy as an entirety and may, as incident
to disposition of matter properly before it, possess jurisdiction to decide
other matters raised by case, though district court could not have taken
cognizance of them if they had been independently presented.  <span style="">x x </span>x
'Ancillary jurisdiction' of federal court generally involves either proceedings
which are concerned with pleadings, processes, records or judgments of court in
principal case or proceedings which affect property already in court's
custody.  <span style="">x x x" </span>(Black's Law Dictionary 79 [5th ed., 1979]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"<u>Incident in the main case</u>" also presupposes a
main case which, perforce, must be within the court's jurisdiction.  <u>Incident</u> is defined thus:</p>

<blockquote><b>Incident</b>.  Used both
substantively and adjectively of a thing which, either usually or naturally and
inseparably, depends upon, appertains to, or follows another that is more
worthy.  Used as a noun, it denotes
anything which inseparably belongs to, or is connected with, or inherent in,
another thing, called the 'principal'.  Also, less strictly, it denotes anything which is usually connected with
another, or connected for some purposes, though not inseparably.  x x x" (Id., at 686)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reliance upon Section 3 of the Interim or Transitional Rules and
Guidelines Implementing B.P. Blg. 129 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"3.  Writs and processes. -- (a) Writs of <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition, <i>mandamus</i>, quo warranto, habeas corpus and injunction issued
by a regional trial court may be enforced in any part of the region.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  All other processes, whether issued by a
regional trial court or a metropolitan trial court, municipal trial court or
municipal circuit trial court may be served anywhere in the Philippines, and,
in the last three cases, without a certification by the judge of the regional
trial court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">is misplaced for the reason that said
section refers to writs or processes issued by a court in a case <u>pending
before it</u> and not to a case yet to be filed with it or pending in another
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of any express statutory provision prohibiting a
court from issuing a search warrant in connection with a crime committed
outside its territorial jurisdiction should not be construed as a grant of
blanket authority to any court of justice in the country to issue a search
warrant in connection with a crime committed outside its territorial jurisdiction.  The majority view suggests or implies that a
municipal trial court in Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, or Batanes can validly entertain
an application for a search warrant and issue one in connection with a crime
committed in Manila.  Elsewise stated,
all courts in the Philippines, including the municipal trial courts, can
validly issue a search warrant in connection with a crime committed anywhere in
the Philippines.  Simply put, all courts
of justice in the Philippines have, for purposes of issuing a search warrant,
jurisdiction over the entire archipelago.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot subscribe to this view since, in the first place, a
search warrant is but an incident to a main case and involves the exercise of
an ancillary jurisdiction therefore, the authority to issue it must necessarily
be co-extensive with the court's territorial jurisdiction.  To hold otherwise would be to add an
exception to the statutory provisions defining the territorial jurisdiction of
the various courts of the country, which would amount to judicial legislation.  The territorial jurisdiction of the courts
is determined by law, and a reading of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 discloses that
the territorial jurisdiction of regional trial courts, metropolitan trial
courts, municipal trial courts and municipal circuit trial courts are confined
to specific territories.  In the second
place, the majority view may legitimize abuses that would result in the
violation the civil rights of an accused or the infliction upon him of undue
and unwarranted burdens and inconvenience as when, for instance, an accused who
is a resident of Basco, Batanes, has to file a motion to quash a search warrant
issued by the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila in connection with an offense
he allegedly committed in Itbayat, Batanes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can <i><span style="">Stonehill vs. </span></i><i><span style="">Diokno</span></i><span style=""> </span>(20 SCRA 383) be an authoritative confirmation of the unlimited
or unrestricted power of any court to issue search warrants <span style="">in </span>connection with crimes committed
outside its territorial jurisdiction.  While it may be true that the forty-two search warrants involved therein
were issued by several Judges -- specifically Judges (a) Amado Roan of the City
Court of Manila, (b) Roman Cansino of the City Court of Manila, (c) Hermogenes
Caluag of the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Quezon City Branch), (d)
Eulogio Mencias of the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasig Branch), and (e)
Damian Jimenez of the City Court of Quezon City (Footnote 2, page 387) -- there
is no definite showing that the forty-two search warrants were for the searches
and seizures of properties outside the territorial jurisdiction of their
respective courts.  The warrants were
issued against the petitioners and corporations of which they were officers and
some of the corporations enumerated in Footnote 7 have addresses in Manila and
Makati. (pp. 388-89).  Rizal (which
includes Makati) and Quezon City both belonged to the Seventh Judicial
District.  That nobody challenged on
jurisdictional ground the issuance of these search warrants is no argument in
favor of the unlimited power of a court to issue search warrants.</p>

<p class="NUM">B. I have serious misgivings on the exception to the second
principle where another court may, because of extreme and compelling
circumstances, issue a search warrant in connection with a criminal case
pending in an appropriate court.  To
illustrate this exception, the Municipal Trial Court of Argao, Cebu, may
validly issue a warrant for the search of a house in Davao City and the seizure
of any property therein that may have been used in committing an offense in Manila
already the subject of an information filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court
of Manila.  I submit that the exception
violates the settled principle that even in cases of concurrent jurisdiction,
the first court which acquires jurisdiction over the case acquires it to the
exclusion of the other.  (<i>People vs.
Fernando</i>, 23 SCRA 867, 870 [1968]).  This being so, it is with more reason that a court which does not have
concurrent jurisdiction with the first which had taken cognizance of the case
does not also have the authority to issue writs or processes, including search
warrants, in connection with the pending case.  Moreover, since the issuance of a search warrant is an incident to a
main case or is an exercise of the ancillary jurisdiction of a court, the court
where the main case is filed has exclusive jurisdiction over all incidents
thereto and in the issuance of all writs and processes in connection
therewith.  Furthermore, instead of
serving the ends of justice, the exception may provide room for unwarranted
abuse of the judicial process, wreak judicial havoc and procedural complexities
which effective law enforcement <span style="">apparently
cannot justify.  I cannot conceive of
any extreme and compelling circumstance which the court that first acquired
jurisdiction over the case cannot adequately meet within its broad powers and
authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the
foregoing, and after re-examining my original view in this case, I respectfully
submit that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
