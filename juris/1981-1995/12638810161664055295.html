the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of herein public respondent
Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="10">October 24,
 1977</st1:date> in CA-G.R. No. 47063-R and its resolution dated <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1983</st1:date> denying herein
petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals narrates the facts thus:</p>

<blockquote>The record shows that on November 16, 1961, Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> filed a complaint against defendants <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Camino as Deputy Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Boix</span>, to annul the auction sale
of a parcel of land, allegedly owned conjugally by plaintiff and his former
wife <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>,
awarded in favor of <span class="SpellE">Boix</span>, as highest bidder, in an <span style="">auction sale conducted on October 10, 1958 by
the Deputy Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, herein
defendant Camino, pursuant to a writ of execution dated August 8, 1958
(Exhibits "C", "2-A) issued by the Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch IV, to enforce its decision in Civil Case No. 33396, entitled,
"Francisco <span class="SpellE">Boix</span>, Plaintiff </span>vs. <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> and Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, Defendants" wherein judgment was rendered to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff,
ordering the defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P2,827.83, <span style="">with interest of 8% per annum on the sum of P1,000.00 from September 5,
1955, on the sum of P1,000.00 from October 30, 1955; and on the sum of P827.83
from December 30, 1955 plus 15% on the total amount of P2,827.83 as attorney’s
fees; and the further amount of P2,503 with interest at 6% per annum from date
of the filing of the complaint, and the costs of the suit." (Exhibit
"1")<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The title to the property, in favor of the execution-creditor <span class="SpellE">Boix</span> was duly registered in the Office of the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte (Exhibit "4").</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is not disputed that plaintiff’s wife, <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> conducted her own logging business in <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In furtherance of her business operation, on <st1:date year="1955" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1955</st1:date>, she secured from
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Boix</span> a loan in the amount of
P2,827.83.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, because of
mismanagement, <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> defaulted in her obligation. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This prompted <span class="SpellE">Boix</span>
to file a complaint, based on <span style="">the
promissory </span>notes executed by <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>, to
collect the sum legally due plus interest against <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>
and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, the latter being joined as husband of
the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-spouses were
declared in default and judgment was rendered, as aforesaid, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Boix</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the aforementioned decision became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, <span class="SpellE">Boix</span> moved to execute
the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The motion </span>was granted and a corresponding writ of execution,
dated <st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1958</st1:date>
(Exhibits "C", "2-A"), was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte levied and attached a parcel of land
situated at Diego <span class="SpellE">Linan</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, declared under Tax No. 05378 in the
sole name of <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>,
subject-parcel of herein suit. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">In </span>a notice of levy on Execution dated
August 22, 1958 (Exhibit "2-B") and notice of Public Auction sale
dated September 10, 1958 (Exhibit "2-C"), auction sales was held on
October 10, 1958 and as <span style="">already
mentioned, defendant <span class="SpellE">Boix</span> was adjudged highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of possession was issued to place the </span>execution-creditor
in possession of the property levied upon and sold on execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A corresponding Certificate of Sale (Exhibit
"H") was also issued in favor of <span class="SpellE">Boix</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, thereafter, Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
filed an Omnibus motion dated <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="10">October
 2, 1961</st1:date> (Exhibit "D") with the same Court of First
Instance of Manila asking to quash the writ of possession, which was denied in
an order dated <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1961</st1:date> (Exhibit
"F") was likewise denied in an order dated <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1962</st1:date> (Exhibit "G").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(PP. 1-4, Decision; pp. 11-14, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, petitioner brought the case to the Court of Appeals
to annul the auction sale allegedly irregularly executed on the following
grounds, namely, that the property was conjugal and thus could not be held
liable for personal debts contracted by the wife, and that there was no valid
publication thus making the auction sale void.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court,
prompting petitioner to file a motion for reconsideration thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was denied on <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1983</st1:date>; hence, the present
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the auction sale of the property in
dispute is null and void, having been made on a date different from that
reflected in the advertisement thereof, aside from having been published in a
newspaper which is not of general circulation in the province where the property
is situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the
petitioner, respondent court’s failure to touch <span style="">on </span>such a jurisdictional issue constitutes grave abuse of
discretion which justifies a reversal of its decision affirming the finding of
the trial court which in itself constitutes a <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span>
of facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other argument advanced by the petitioner is that the subject
property is really conjugal which the wife in the case at bar could not legally
bind, and considering that the indebtedness was contracted by the wife only,
the levy of the subject property not owned exclusively by the wife but owned
jointly with the husband is improper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against petitioner’s argument that the auction sale is null and
void is the trial court’s assessment of the validity thereof, that is, that the
notice of public auction sale was published in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a factual finding of the trial court is
entitled to great weight and should not be disturbed on appeal. "Factual
questions should be resolved by the lower courts and the Supreme Court has no
jurisdiction as a rule to reverse the findings of the lower courts except in a
clear showing of a grave abuse of discretion" (Korean Air Lines vs. CA,
154 SCRA 211).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case,
petitioner failed to show any grave abuse of discretion committed by the lower
court in appreciating private respondent’s allegation that petitioner was
previously notified of the supposed transfer of the date of public auction from
September 25, 1958 to October 10, 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner’s other argument is also based on factual
considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against the Court of
Appeals’ finding that the subject property is <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>
property, in view of the fact that it was "declared, under Tax No. 05378,
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
while the house erected thereon was declared under Tax No. 06022 in the name of
Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> B.
<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> (Exhibits "B", "H",
"2-B", "2-C", "4") (Decision, p. <span style="">4) </span>is petitioner’s claim that the
subject property is conjugal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
stresses heavily on the fact that since the surname "<span class="SpellE">Ong</span>"
(which is the surname of the husband Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>)
was carried by <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> in the aforesaid tax
declaration, that indicates that the subject property was acquired during the
marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By <span style="">reason </span>thereof, the property in dispute is presumed to be owned
jointly by both spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere use
of the surname of the husband in the tax declaration of the subject property is
not sufficient proof that said property was acquired during the marriage and is
therefore conjugal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed
that the subject parcel was declared solely in the wife’s name, but the house
built thereon was declared in the name of the spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Under
such circumstances, coupled with a careful scrutiny of the </span>records of
the present case, We hold that the lot in question is <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>,
and is therefore, liable for the personal debts of the wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it was held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>
vs. Lozano, 20 SCRA 474, that</p>

<blockquote>"The presumption that property is
conjugal (Art. 160, New Civil Code) refers to property acquired during the marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When there is no showing as to when the
property was acquired by a spouse, the fact that the <span style="">title is in the spouse’s name is an indication that the property
belongs exclusively to said spouse."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by the respondent Court, the party who
invokes the presumption that all property of the marriage belongs to the
conjugal partnership (Art. 160, New Civil Code) must first prove that the
property was acquired during the marriage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proof of acquisition during the marriage is a condition <u><span style="">sine</span></u><span style=""> <u>qua</u> </span><u>non</u> for the operation of the presumption in
favor of the conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Cobb-Perez, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, et al., 23
SCRA 637; Jose Ponce de Leon vs. Rehabilitation Finance Corp., 36 SCRA
289).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, the recent
case of PNB vs. Court of Appeals, 153 SCRA 435 affirms that:</p>

<blockquote>"When the property is registered in the name of a spouse only
and there is no showing as to when the property was acquired by said spouse,
this is an indication that the property belongs exclusively to said spouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this presumption under Art. 160 of the
Civil Code cannot prevail when the title is in the name of only one spouse and
the rights of innocent third parties are involved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, even assuming for the sake of argument that the
property in dispute is conjugal, the same may still be held liable for the
debts of the wife in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Art. 117 of the Civil Code, the wife may engage in business although the
husband may object (but subject to certain conditions).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the records that the wife
was engaged in the logging business with the husband’s knowledge and apparently
without any objection on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
acts of the husband show that he gave his implied consent to the wife’s engagement
in business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Justice <span class="SpellE">Ameurfina</span>-Herrera (then Associate Justice of the Court of
Appeals) in her concurring opinion, the rule that should govern in that case is
that the wife’s <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> properties, as well as
those of their conjugal partnership, shall be liable for the obligations
incurred by the wife in the course of her business (Arts. 117, 140, 172, 203,
and 236, Civil Code; Art. 10, Code of Commerce, cited in Commentaries on Phil.
Commercial Laws, Martin, T.C. Vol. 1, 1970 Revised Edition, pp. 14-15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, whatever profits are earned by the
wife from her business go to the conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would only be just and equitable that the
obligations contracted by the wife in connection with her business may also be
chargeable not only against her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> property
but also against the conjugal property of the spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let it be noted that due to the length of time that this case has
remained pending, private respondents Francisco <span class="SpellE">Boix</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Camino have allegedly already died in the
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No proper substitution of
parties have apparently been made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, despite such supervening events, for failure on the part
of petitioner to show any grave abuse of discretion or reversible error
committed by respondent appellate court, We deem it wise to affirm the said
court’s decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the decision
of the trial court is in accordance with law and the evidence presented.</p>

merit without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
