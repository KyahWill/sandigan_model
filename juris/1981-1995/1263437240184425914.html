				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE RODOLFO M. BELLAFLOR, ASSISTING JUDGE, BRANCH 28, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDAUE CITY, AND REUBEN ALBAÑO, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeks to annul the resolution issued by
respondent judge Rodolfo M. Bellaflor in Criminal Case No. DU-1805 dated June
26, 1991, containing the following disposition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court resolves to grant the motion for
reconsideration filed by accused being meritorious and hereby sets aside the
decision dated February 6, 1991 and promulgated on May 3, 1991 for being null
and void, and finally, to ACQUIT the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent Reuben
Albaño, the accused in Criminal Case No. DU-1805, was charged with the crime of
arson before the Regional Trial Court of Mandaue City, Branch 28, then presided
by Judge Willelmo C. Fortun as assisting judge.  Upon arraignment, private respondent pleaded "not
guilty".  Thereafter, trial on the
merits ensued and the parties rested their case before Judge Fortun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on February 4, 1991, Judge Fortun was designated
as Assisting Judge for the Regional Trial Court in the National Capital
Judicial Region, to hold office in the Office of the Court Administrator of the
Supreme Court in Manila (Administrative Order No. 10-91, later amended by AO
No. 10­-91A dated February 12, 1991, designating Judge Fortun to assist Judge
Ricardo Diaz of RTC, Br. 27, NCJR, and to hold office thereat).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 13, 1991, respondent judge Rodolfo M. Bellaflor was
assigned as replacement of Judge Fortun and assisting judge of the Regional
Trial Court of Mandaue, Branch 28, wherein the criminal case against private
respondent was pending.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1991, Judge Fortun promulgated his decision dated
February 6, 1991, convicting private respondent of the crime of arson.  At the time of promulgation of Judge
Fortun's decision, respondent judge was already presiding as assisting judge of
Branch 28 of the Regional Trial Court in Mandaue City.  On May 9, 1991 private respondent moved for
the recon­sideration of the said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 26, 1991, respondent judge issued a resolution referred
to above granting private respondent's motion for reconsideration and acquitted
the latter of the crime charged (Rollo, pp. 31-32).  In the same resolution, the <span style="">decision
rendered by Judge Fortun was declared null and void for having been promulgated
after said judge had vacated his office and after being assigned to the Office
of the Court Administrator in Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 1, 1991,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition, petitioner claims that respondent judge
acted with grave abuse of discretion in granting the motion for reconsideration
of private respondent and acquitting the latter.  On the other hand, private respondent argues that the resolution
acquitting him of the offense charged has become final and executory and a
reconsideration thereof would place him under double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's reliance on the defense of double jeopardy
is misplaced.  In order that a defendant
may successfully allege former jeopardy, it is necessary that he had previously
been (1) convicted or (2) acquitted, or (3) in jeopardy of being convicted of
the offense charged, that is, that the former case against him for the same
offense has been dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent,
by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information,
and after the defendant has pleaded to the charge.  (People vs. Asuncion, 208 SCRA 231 [1992], People vs. Puno, 208
SCRA [1992], Bogo Medellin vs. Son, 209 SCRA 329 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Generally, protection
against double jeopardy is not available where the dismissal of the case was
effected at the instance of the accused.  And there are only two instances where double jeopardy will attach
notwithstanding the fact the case was dismissed with the express consent of the
accused.  The first is where the ground
for the dismissal is insufficiency of the evidence for the prosecution and the
second is where the criminal proceedings have been unreasonably prolonged in
violation of the accused's right to speedy trial (People v. Quizada, 160 SCRA
516 [1988]).  None exists in the case at
bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, private respondent had moved for the dismissal of the
criminal case filed against him and therefore, the protective mantle of double
jeopardy does not cover him.  As pointed
out by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x, private respondent's acquittal was upon his motion and
with his express consent.  In People v.
Villon, 192 SCRA 521, this Honorable Court likewise stated: </blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"However, an appeal by the prosecution from the order of
dismissal of the criminal case shall not constitute double jeopardy if (1) the
dismissal is made upon motion, or with the express consent of the defendant,
and (2) the dismissal is not an acquittal or based upon consideration of the
evidence or of the merits of the case; and (3) the question to be passed upon
by the appellate court is purely legal so that should the dismissal be found incorrect,
the case would have to be remanded to the court of origin for further
proceedings, to determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant."
(Rollo, pp. 142­-143)</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, private respondent cannot successfully seek refuge in
the assailed resolution of respondent judge.  For one thing, <span style="">it </span>was an
empty judgment of acquittal – a bare adjudication that private respondent is
not guilty of the offense charged anchored on the mere supposition that the
decision rendered by Judge Fortun was a nullity.  Indeed, respondent judge acquitted private respondent without
expressing the facts and the law on which it is based, as required by Section
14, Article VIII of the Constitution.  This can be clearly seen from the resolution issued by respondent judge
which we quote in its entirety, to wit:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"RESOLUTION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This is with reference to the motion for reconsideration
filed by the accused from the decision dated February 6, 1991 and promulgated
only on May 3, 1991 on the following grounds:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.  The decision being prepared and signed by
the previous Judge Willelmo Fortun but promulgated only after he has ceased or
relieved as incumbent judge is null and void and may be set aside or modified;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  The sentence is imposed, being based on
paragraph 4, Art. 322 of the Revised Penal Code, has no binding force and
effect because said law has been repealed by P.D. 1613 and was not revived by
P.D. 1744;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  The law applicable is P.D. 1615 and as such,
the issue of ownership of the shed that was burned which was raised by the
accused must be resolved and considered in the new decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There was no opposition filed thereto by the prosecution in
spite of due notice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the three grounds invoked by the accused in his
motion for reconsideration, the Court is more engrossed in the 1st ground.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is undisputed that when the decision was promulgated on
May 3, 1991, Judge Willelmo A. Fortun who rendered the decision was no longer
sitting in this Court as he has been transferred and was relieved as incumbent
judge of this court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is now firmly established in our jurisprudence that a
decision is void if promulgated after the judge who rendered it had permanently
ceased to be a judge of the court where he sat in judgment, thus, a judgment is
a nullity if it had been promulgated after the judge had actually vacated the
office and accepted another office (Lino Luna vs. Rodriguez, 37 Phil. 186); or
when the term of office of the judge has ended (Garchitorena vs. Crescini, 37
Phil. 675); or when he has left the bench (People vs. C.G. et al. 99 Phil.
786); or after the judge had vacated his post in view of the abolition of his
position as Judge-at-large under Rep. Act 1186 (People vs. Bonifacio So, 101
Phil. 1257 unrep.); or after the cessation or termination of his incumbency as
judge; or a sentence has been set aside where the judge who presided in the
Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija had been extended on ad interim
appointment to the Court of First Instance of Manila to which position he
qualified before the judgment was filed with the Clerk of Court of the former
Court (People vs. Soria, 22 SCRA 948).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The case of bar falls squarely in the legion of cases quoted
above.  The judge who rendered the
decision ceased to be the judge of that court when the decision was
promulgated.  On this score alone, the
decision in the above-entitled case which was promulgated in (sic) null and
void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The rest of the grounds are denied for lack of merit as these
were considered in the decision sought to be set aside or reconsidered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court resolves to grant the motion for
reconsideration filed by the accused being meritorious and hereby sets aside
the decision dated February 6, 1991 and promulgated on May 3, 1991 for being
null and void and finally, to acquit the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (pp. 31-32, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is indubitable that the acquittal of private respondent was
not based upon consideration of the evidence or of the merits of the case.  Furthermore, it is a requirement of due
process that the parties to a litigation be informed of how it was decided,
with an explanation of the factual findings and legal justifications that led
to the conclusions of the court (Nicos Industrial Corp., <span style="">vs. CA, 206 SCRA 127 [</span>1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Granting, <i><span style="">ex </span></i><i><span style="">gratia argumenti</span></i><span style="">, </span>that the decision of Judge Fortun was
not validly promulgated, such invalidity, <i><span style="">per se</span></i><span style="">, </span>does
not necessarily operate for the acquittal of the accused.  In such instances, the case should have been
subjected for new adjudication based on the evidence already submitted by the
parties and for further proceedings conformably with law (Solis v. Court of
Appeals, 38 SCRA 53 [1971]).  If at all,
it was the precipitate order of respondent judge acquitting private respondent
which should be voided.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the main issue, petitioner claims that Section 9,
Rule 135 of the Rules of Court allows the promulgation of a judgment by a judge
who has been transferred or assigned to another court of equal
jurisdiction.  In this regard, it is the
submission of petitioner that even though Judge Fortun had been assigned to the
Office of the Court Administrator in Manila, he still retained the position of
judge of the Regional Trial Court.  It
is petitioner's contention that this is all that is required for a judge who has
been re-assigned and transferred to a court of equal jurisdiction to be able to
prepare and sign a <span style="">decision in a case
totally heard by him and which was argued prior to such transfer or
reassignment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is merit in the
above submission.  Section 9 of Rule 135
of the Rules of Court provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 9. <i><span style="">Signing
judgment </span>out </i><i><span style="">of the </span>province.</i>?Whenever
a judge appointed or assigned in any province or branch of a Court of First
Instance (now Regional Trial Court) in a province shall leave the province by <u>transfer
or assignment to another court of equal jurisdiction, or by expiration of his
temporary assignment</u>, without having decided a case totally heard by him
and which was argued or an opportunity given for argument to the parties or
their counsel, it shall be lawful for him to prepare and sign his decision in
said case anywhere within the Philippines.  He shall send the same by registered mail to the clerk of the court
where the case was heard or argued to be filed therein as of the date when the same
was received by the clerk, in the same manner as if he had been present in
court to direct the filing of the judgment.  If the case has been heard only in part, the Supreme Court, upon
petition of any of the parties to the case and the recommendation of the
respective district judge, may also authorize the judge who has partly heard
the case, if no other judge had heard the case in part, to continue hearing and
<u>to decide said case notwithstanding his transfer or appointment to another
court of equal jurisdiction</u>." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the <span style="">above provision,
it is clear that the signing or writing of an order or judgment outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the court wherein the case is pending is authorized
only when the judge leaves the province "by transfer or assignment to
another court of equal jurisdiction" or by "expiration of his
temporary assignment".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, decisions
promulgated after the judge who penned the same had been appointed to and
qualified in another office are null and void (Lino Luna v. Rodriguez, 37 Phil.
186 [</span>1917]).  It is <span style="">settled that to be binding a judgment must be
duly signed and promulgated during the incumbency of the judge whose signature
appears thereon (Jimenez vs. Republic, 22 SCRA 622 [1968], Jandayan vs. Ruiz, </span>95
<span style="">SCRA 563 [1980]).  In single courts like the regional trial
courts and the municipal trial courts, a decision may no longer be promulgated
after the </span><i><span style="">ponente</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">has
vacated his office (Consolidated Bank and Trust Co. vs. </span>IAC, 189 SCRA <span style="">433 </span>[1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Judge Fortun's assignment, however, he was merely
transferred from the Regional Trial Court of Mandaue to act as Assisting judge
of another Regional Trial Court, specifically RTC Br. 27, NCJR, Manila.  Judge Fortun did not vacate his office as
judge of a Regional Trial Court which would have otherwise nullified his
decision rendered in Criminal Case No. <span style="">DU-1805.  </span>On the contrary, Judge Fortun was
merely temporarily assigned to a court of equal jurisdiction, during which time
the decision convicting private respondent was promulgated.  Under Section 9, Rule <span style="">35 </span>of the Rules of Court, Judge Fortun
still possessed the judicial authority and competence to decide a case fully
heard by him and to promulgate a decision thereon while on temporary assignment
to a court of equal jurisdiction in Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, we hold that respondent judge committed
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in nullifying the
decision rendered by Judge Fortun.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <span style="">the
petition </span>is GRANTED.  The
resolution of respondent judge acquitting private respondent Reuben Albaño is
hereby SET ASIDE for being null and void and the decision of Judge Willelmo
Fortun convicting accused Albaño is hereby REINSTATED.</p>
