charged <span class="SpellE">Reynerio</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>,
a member of the Philippine Bar, with malpractice and breach of trust.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant spouses alleged, among
others, that respondent had, by means of fraud and deceit, taken advantage of
their precarious financial situation and his knowledge of the law to their
prejudice, succeeded in divesting them of their only residential lot in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> City:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that
respondent, who was their counsel in an <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case

<p class="BODY">In his answer dated <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="3">18

<p class="BODY">By resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="4">14

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Solicitor General forthwith deputized the City
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> City, Jorge T. <span class="SpellE">Almonte</span>,
to conduct the necessary investigation, with instructions to submit thereafter
his report and recommendation thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

administrative case until <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="7">15 July 1982</st1:date>,

<blockquote>Complainants allege that on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="8">August
 5, 1975</st1:date>, they obtained from respondent a loan of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This loan
was secured by a real estate mortgage (Annex C, Complainants’ Complaint, p. 16,
records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the said Real Estate
Mortgage document, however, it was made to appear that the amount borrowed by
complainants was P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Confronted by this discrepancy, respondent
assured complainants that said document was a mere formality, and upon such
assurance, complainants signed the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The document was brought by complainant <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Melendres</span> to a Notary Public for notarization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the same was notarized, he gave the
document to respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
assurance, respondent exacted from complainants P500.00 a month as payment for
what is beyond dispute usurious interest on the P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainants religiously paid the
obviously usurious interest for three months:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>September, October and November, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then they stopped paying due to financial reverses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of their failure to pay said amounts
as interest, respondent prepared a new document on May 7, 1976, a Real Estate
Mortgage (Annex D, Complaint, p. 18, records) over the same lot 3125-C,
replacing the former real estate mortgage dated August 5, 1975, but this time
the sum indicated in said new contract of mortgage is P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
purportedly with interest at 19% per annum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this new Real Estate Mortgage, a special power of attorney in favor
of respondent was inserted, authorizing him to sell the mortgaged property at
public auction in the event complainants fail to pay their obligation on or
before <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without explaining the provisions of the new
contract to complainants, respondent insisted that complainants sign the same,
again upon the assurance that the document was a mere formality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unsuspecting of the motive of respondent,
complainants signed the document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainants <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>
again brought the same document to a Notary Public for notarization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the document was notarized, he brought
the same to respondent without getting a copy of it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainants, relying on the assurance of the respondent that the
second Real Estate Mortgage was but a formality, neither bothered to ask from
respondent the status of their lot nor tried to pay their obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For their failure to pay the obligation, the
respondent on <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="10">October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">12, </span>1976</st1:date>, applied for the
extrajudicial foreclosure of the second real estate mortgage (Exhibit 16,
Respondent's Position Paper).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All the
requirements of Act No. 3135, as amended, re extra­judicial sale of mortgage
were ostensibly <span class="GramE">complied</span> with by respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, finally, title was transferred to him,
and on <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1979</st1:date>,
respondent sold the involved property to Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Ylanan</span>
for P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When informed of the above by one <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> <span class="SpellE">Australlado</span> on the first week of March 1979 (see Sworn
Statement of complainant <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>,
p. 6, Folder No. 2 of case), and not having known the legal implications of the
provisions of the second Real Estate Mortgage which they had executed,
complainants could not believe that title to their lot had already been
transferred to respondent and that respondent had already sold the same to a
third person.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon learning of the sale in March, 1979, complainants tried to
raise the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and went to
respondent's house on <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1979</st1:date>
to pay their obligation, hoping that they could redeem their property, although
three years had already lapsed from the date of the mortgage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent did not accept the proffered P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
but instead gave complainants a sheet<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>of
paper (Annex B, Complainants’ Position Paper), which indicated that the total
indebtedness had soared to P20,400.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The computation was made in respondent's own handwriting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainants went home with shattered hopes
and with grief in their hearts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the instant complaint for disbarment against respondent filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1979</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent DENIES all the allegations of complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He maintains that what appears on the two
documents allegedly executed by complainants, i.e., that they obtained a loan
of P5,000.00 on August 5, 1975 and another <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">P10,000.00 </span>on May 7, 1976, is allegedly the truth, and claims
that he in truth delivered the alleged amount of P5,000.00 to complainants and
not P4,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the
second loan, respondent claims that he delivered to complainants P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, plus the P2,000.00 loan previously extended [to] complainants
[by] one <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Villanueva, which loan had been
indorsed to respondent for collection, thus making a total of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">P10,000.00, </span>as appearing on said
document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent denies that he
exacted usurious interest of 10% a month or P500.00 from complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asserts that the fact that complainants
were able to secure a loan from the Insular Bank of Asia and America (IBAA)
only proves the truth of his allegation that the title of the property, at the
time complainants obtained a loan from IBAA on April 1976, was clear of any
encumbrance, since complainants had already paid the original loan of P5,000.00
obtained from respondent; that complainants knew fully well all the conditions
of said mortgage; and that his acquisition of the property in question was in
accordance with their contract and the law on the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he denies that he has violated any
right of the complainants.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>After weighing the evidence of both complainants and respondent,
we find against respondent</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While complainants are correct in their claim that they actually
obtained an actual cash of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, they are only
partly correct in the claim that out of the P10,000.00 appearing in the second
Real Estate Mortgage, P6,000.00 was applied to interest considering that not
all the P6,000.00 but only P4,000.00 was applied to interest, computed as
follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the first loan of P5,000.00 was
supposedly due on August 31, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainants paid 10% monthly interest or P500.00 on <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1975</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1975</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently, beginning <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1975</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1976</st1:date> (the date of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span>the execution of the second Real Estate Mortgage) a total of
six (6) months lapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Six (6) months at
P500.00 equals P3,000.00, which amount plus the P2,000.00 complainants’ loan to
one <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. Villanueva (indorsed to respondent for
collection) totals <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">P5,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Adding this amount to the previous
P5,000.00 indicated loan secured by the first mortgage results in <u>P10,000.00</u>,
the amount appearing in the second Real Estate Mortgage.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 7.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rule 130 of the Rules of Court provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'SEC. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">7.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">Evidence of written agreements.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- When the terms of an agreement have been
reduced to writing, it is to be considered as containing all such terms, and,
therefore, there can be, as between the parties and their successors in
interest, no evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the
terms of the agreement other than the contents of the writing, except in the
following cases:</p>

<p class="2Q">(a) Where a mistake <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>imperfection
of the writing, or its failure to express the true intent and agreement of the
parties, or the validity of the agreement is put in issue by the pleadings;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt;tab-stops:-9.0pt 0in">(b)
Where there is an intrinsic ambiguity in the writing.</p>

<p class="2Q">The term "agreement" includes wills.’</p>

<blockquote>There is no dispute that the two documents denominated Real Estate
Mortgages covering the supposed original loan of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and the inflated P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">1</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">0,000.00, </span>respectively, were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">voluntarily signed by the complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">general rule is that when the parties have reduced their a</span>g<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">reement to writing, it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">presumed that they have made the writin</span>g<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> the only repository and memorial of the truth, and whatever is not
found in the writing must be understood to have been waived and abandoned.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>However, the rule is not absolute as it admits of some exceptions,
as <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One of the exceptions, that is, failure to express the true intent and
agreement of the parties, applies in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><u>From the facts </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">obtaining
</span>in the case, it is clear that the complainants were induced to sign the
Real Estate Mortgage documents by the false and fraudulent representations of
respondent that each of the successive documents was a mere formality</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">may </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">true that </span>complainants are not at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">all </span>illiterate, respondent, being a lawyer,
should have at least explained to complainants the legal implications of the p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">rovisions </span>of the real estate mortgage,
particularly the provision appointing him as the complainants' attorney-in­-fact
in the event of default in payments on the part of complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it may be conceded that it is presumed
that in practice the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">notary </span>public
apprises complainants of the legal implications of the contract, it is of
common knowledge that most notaries public do not go through the desired
practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent at least could have
informed the complainants by sending a demand letter to them to pay their
obligation as otherwise he would proceed to sell the lot at public auction as
per their contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This respondent
failed to do, despite the fact that he knew fully well that complainants were
trying their best to raise money to be able to pay their obligation to him, as
shown by the loan obtained by complainants from the IBAA on <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it may be stated that
complainants, per advice of respondent himself, returned the proceeds of the
IBAA loan to the bank immediately on April 30, 1976, considering that the net
proceeds of the loan from said bank was only P4<span class="GramE">,300.00</span>
and not enough to pay the indicated loan from respondent of P5,000.00, which
per computation of respondent would already have earned interest of P2,500.00
for five (5) months (December 1975 to April, 1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent claims that complainants had paid him the original loan
of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and that this was the reason why complainants
were able to mortgage the lot to the bank free from any encumbrance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This claim is incorrect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason why the title (T-2684) was free
from any encumbrance was simply because of the fact that the first Real Estate
Mortgage for the indicated loan of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (the
actual amount was only P4,000.00) had not been annotated at the back of the
title (see Annex B, p. 14, rec.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent also denies that complainants offered to him the amount
of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>payment of the loan, alleging <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that
</span>if the offer were true, he could have readily accepted the same since he
sold the lot for almost the same amount, for only P12,000.00, a difference of a
few thousand pesos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's denial
is specious.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Indeed, complainants made the offer, but respondent refused the
same for the simple reason that the offer was made on <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1979</st1:date>, three (3) years after the execution
of the mortgage on <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With this lapse of time, respondent demanded
obviously the payment of the accumulated substantial interest for three years,
as shown by<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:28.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his own computation in his own handwriting on
a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">sheet of paper (Annex C,
Complainants’ Position Paper, <span class="GramE">Folder</span> No. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, the observation made by the Hearing
Officer is worth quoting:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In the humble opinion of the undersigned the pivotal question with
respect to this particular charge is whose version is to be believed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it the version of the complainants or the
version of the <span class="GramE">respondent.</span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">In resolving this issue the</span>
possible motive on the part of the complainants in filing the present complaint
against the respondent must be carefully examined and considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the beginning there was a harmonious
relationship between the complainants and the respondent so much so that
respondent was even engaged as counsel of the complainants and it is but human
nature that when respondent extended a loan to the complainants the latter
would be grateful to the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">However, in the case at </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">bar, </span>complainants filed a complaint
against the respondent in spite of the great disparity between the status of
the complainants and the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly, respondent is in a better position financially, socially and
intellectually.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the mind of the
undersigned, complainants were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">only </span>compelled
to file the above-entitled complaint against the respondent because they felt
that they are so aggrieved of what the respondent has done to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason therefore that the
undersigned is inclined to believe the version of the complainants rather than
of the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition thereto,
the respondent as a lawyer could really see to it that the transaction between
the complainants and <span class="GramE">himself</span> on papers appear legal
and in order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, there is ample
evidence in the records of this case that respondent is actually engaged in
lending money at least in a limited way and that the interest at the rate of
ten per cent a month is but common among money lenders during the time of the
transactions in question.'</p>

<blockquote>Going now into the second charge, complainants alleged that
respondent, who was their counsel (private prosecutor) in Criminal Case No.
734, for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, against accused Reynaldo Pineda,
compromised the case with the accused without their consent and received the
amount of P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">5</span>00.00 as advance
payment for the amicable settlement, without however, giving to the
complainants the said amount nor informing them of said settlement and payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Again, respondent denies the allegation and claims that the
amicable settlement was with the consent of complainant wife <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalman</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Melendre</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>z).</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>We are inclined to believe the version of the complainants</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is admitted that complainants were not interested in putting the
accused Reynaldo Pineda to jail but rather in merely recovering their money of
P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
this stage, relationship between complainants and respondent was not yet
strained, and respondent, as counsel of the complainants in this case, knew
that complainants were merely interested in said recovery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowing this, respondent on his own volition
talked to accused and tried to settle the case amicably for P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He accepted
the amount of P500.00 as advance payment, being then the only amount carried by
the accused Pineda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A receipt was signed
by both respondent and accused Pineda (Annex M, p. 34, record).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, respondent did not inform
complainants about this advance payment, perhaps because he was still waiting
for the completion of the payment of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> before
turning over the whole amount to complainants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At any rate, complainants saw accused Pineda give the
above-mentioned P500.00 to respondent, but they were ashamed then to ask
directly of respondent what the money was all about.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On June 27, 1979, barely a month after May 30, 1979, when the
complainants had already lost their trust and respect and/or confidence in
respondent upon knowing what happened to their lot and, more so, upon
respondent's refusal to accept the P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> offered
by complainants to redeem the same,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Melendre</span>[z] saw the
accused Pineda on his way home and confronted him on the P500.00 that had been
given to respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused then showed
complainant <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span> the receipt (Annex M, id.)
showing that the P500.00 was an advance payment for the supposed
settlement/dismissal of the case filed by complainants against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sensing or feeling that respondent was fooling <span class="GramE">them</span>,
complainants then filed a motion before the court which was trying the criminal
case and relieved respondent as their counsel.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>The Investigating Fiscal, who heard the case and saw the demeanor
of the witnesses in testifying, had this to say:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'With respect to the second charge, the fact that
respondent received P500.00 from Reynaldo Pineda is duly established.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both the complainants and the respondent
agreed that the said amount was given to the respondent in connection with a
criminal case wherein the complainants were the private offended parties:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that Reynaldo Pineda is the accused and that
the respondent is the private prosecutor of the said case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pivotal issue in this particular charge
is whether the respondent received the amount of P500.00 from Reynaldo Pineda
as an advance payment of an amicable settlement entered into by the
complainants and the accused or the respondent received said amount from the
accused without the knowledge and consent of the complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is true as alleged by the respondent
that he only received it for and in behalf of the complainants as advance
payment of an amicable settlement why is it that the same was questioned by the
complainants?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why is it that it was not
the complainants who signed the receipt for the said amount?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How come that as soon as complainants know
that the said amount was given to the respondent, the former filed a motion in
court to relieve respondent as their counsel on the ground that they have lost
faith and confidence on him?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is
really true that complainants have knowledge and have consented to this
amicable settlement they should be grateful to the efforts of their private
prosecutor, yet the fact is that they resented the same and went to the extent
of disqualifying the respondent as their private prosecutor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo Pineda himself executed an affidavit
belying the claim of the respondent.'</p>

were held under Provincial Fiscal Pedro S. <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In those hearings, the complainants presented
a number of witnesses who, after their direct testimony, were cross-examined by
the counsel for respondent:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>complainant <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Melendrez</span> also testified
and was accordingly cross-examined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">long </span>delay
incurred in the investigation of the administrative case and having been
pressed by the Solicitor General immediately to complete the investigation,
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> proposed a change of procedure, from
trial-type proceedings to requiring the parties to submit their respective
position papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">The </span>complainants immediately filed their position paper which
consisted of their separate sworn statements, (that of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Melendrez</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was
</span>in a question and answer form), their documentary exhibits and an
affidavit of one <span class="SpellE">Jeorge</span> G. Santos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent also filed his counter-affidavit
and affidavits of his witnesses, with several annexes in support thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the hearing of 28 October 1987, which had
been set for the cross-examination of the complainants and their witnesses by
respondent, the complainants refused to submit themselves to cross-examination
on the ground that the order of the hearing officer dated 17 December 1986
declaring respondent's right of cross examination as having been waived, had
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent questions now the evidentiary
value of the complainants' position paper, not having passed through any
cross-examination and argues that the non-submission of the complainants and
their witnesses to cross-examination constitutes a denial of his right to due
process.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not think respondent's right to confront the complainants
and their witnesses against him has been violated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent in fact cross-examined complainant
<span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Melendrez</span> and some
of the witnesses which complainants had presented earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by the Solicitor General, the
record of the proceedings shows that respondent had all the opportunity to
cross-examine the other witnesses of the complainants (those whose affidavits
were attached to complainants' position paper) had he wanted to, but had
forfeited such opportunity by asking for numerous continuances which indicated
a clear attempt on his part to delay the investigation proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent had in fact requested a total of
twenty three (23) <span class="SpellE">resettings</span> during the investigation
proceedings:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>he had eight (8) under
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Almonte</span> and fifteen (15) under Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span class="GramE">were also</span> instances where respondent asked for postponement
and at the same time reset the hearing to a specific date of his choice on
which neither he nor his counsel would appear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That attitude of respondent eventually led the hearing officer to
declare his (respondent's) right to cross-examine the complainants and their
witnesses as having been waived in his order of <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="12">17 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">December </span>1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent can not now claim that he had been
deprived below of the opportunity to confront the complainants and their
witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully going through the record of the proceedings as
well as the evidence presented by both parties, we agree with the findings and
conclusions of the Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following acts of respondent:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">making</span> it appear on
the <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="8">5 August 1975</st1:date> real

the second real estate mortgage of <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="5">7
 May 1976</st1:date> that the loan extended to complainants had escalated to
P10,000.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">failing</span> to inform
complainants of the import of the real mortgage documents and inducing them to
sign those documents with assurances that they were merely for purposes of

<blockquote>6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">failing</span> to inform or
refraining from informing complainants that the real estate mortgage had
already been foreclosed and that complainants had a right to redeem the

that the acts of respondent "imply something immoral in <span class="GramE">themselves</span>
regardless of whether they are punishable by law" and that these acts
constitute moral turpitude, being "contrary to justice, honesty, modesty
or good morals".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The standard
required from members of the Bar is not, of course, satisfied by conduct which
merely avoids collision with our criminal law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even so, respondent's conduct, in fact, may be <span class="SpellE">penalizable</span>
under at least one penal statute - the anti-usury law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second charge against respondent relates to acts done in his
professional <span class="GramE">capacity, that</span> is, done at a time when he
was counsel for the complainants in a criminal case for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
against accused Reynaldo Pineda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
are two (2) aspects to this charge:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the
first is that respondent <span class="SpellE">Decena</span> effected a compromise
agreement concerning the civil liability of accused Reynaldo Pineda without the
consent and approval of the complainants:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>the second is that, having received the amount of P500.00 as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>advance payment on this
"settlement." he failed to inform complainants of that advance
payment and moreover, did not turn over the P500.00 to the complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts show that respondent
"settled" the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case amicably for P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> without the knowledge and consent of
complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent informed
complainants of the amicable "settlement" and of the P500.00 advance
payment only after petitioner <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Melendrez</span> had confronted him about these matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And respondent never did turn over to
complainants the P500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent is
presumed to be aware of the rule that lawyers cannot "without special
authority, compromise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their clients’
litigation or receive anything in discharge of a client's claim, but the full
amount in cash."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Respondent's failure to turn over to
