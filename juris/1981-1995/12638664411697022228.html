<p class="BODY">The Second Division of this Court, after the filing of the

brief on June 6<span class="GramE">,1985</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">The main issues in this case are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(a) on the procedural aspect, whether or not the Court of Tax Appeals
has jurisdiction over this case and (b) on the merits, whether or not Union
Shipping Corporation acting as a mere "husbanding agent" of Yee Fong
Hong Ltd. is liable for payment of taxes on the gross receipts or earnings of
the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of this petition is that the issuance of a
warrant or <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">is proof </span>of the finality of an assessment because it is the most
drastic action of all media of enforcing the collection of tax, and is
tantamount to an outright denial of a motion for reconsideration of an
assessment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among others, petitioner
contends that the warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy was
issued after <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> filed a request
for reconsideration of subject assessment, thus constituting petitioner's final
decision in the disputed assessments (Brief for Petitioner, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pp. </span>9 and 12).</p>

therefore </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">that the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">period to appeal to the </span>Court of Tax

</span>November 25, 1976, so that on January 10, 1979 when respondent
corporation sought redress from the Tax Court, petitioner's decision has long
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On this issue, this Court
had already laid down the dictum </span>that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

needless difficulty, the taxpayer would be able to determine when <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">his right to </span>appeal to the tax court

</span>obviate all desire and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">opportunity

assessment – and, consequently, the collection of the amount demanded as taxes ­-
by repeated requests for <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> and
reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the part of the
Commissioner, this would encourage his office to conduct a careful and thorough
study of every questioned assessment and render a correct and definite decision
thereon in the first instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
would also deter the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Commissioner from
unfairly making the taxpayer </span>grope <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in

v. C.T.A., 57 SCRA 523, 528, [11974]).</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no dispute that petitioner did not rule on
private respondent's motion for reconsideration but <span class="SpellE">contary</span>
to the above ruling of this Court, left private respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the dark as to which action of the
Commissioner is the decision <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court
of Tax Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had he categorically
stated that he denies private respondent's motion for reconsideration and that
his action constitutes his final determination on the disputed assessment, private
respondent without needless difficulty would have been able to determine when
his right to appeal accrues and the resulting confusion would have been
avoided.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Much </span>later, this

that the <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> decision of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue is that contained in the letter of its Commissioner, that such
constitutes the final decision on the matter which may be appealed to the Court
