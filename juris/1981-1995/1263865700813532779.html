				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The main issue in this petition is whether private respondent,
Rosa <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>, voluntarily resigned from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">her </span>work at petitioner corporation,
Great Pacific Life Assurance Corporation, or whether the corporation
constructively dismissed her or forced her to resign.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ms. Rosa <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> alleged that she was
hired by GREPALIFE as clerk in its regional office in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte sometime in January, 1969.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After only three (3) months <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on </span>the job, she was promoted to
Regional Cashier at the same station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
1971, she was transferred to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

that city, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">where </span>she remained
with the company until <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">May </span>25, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of her separation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">she was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">receiving </span>P2<span class="GramE">,230.00</span> a month.</p>

<p class="BODY">She further alleged that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">on
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">April
4, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1984,
</span>Ms. Rosa Y. <span class="SpellE">Choa</span>, the corporation's Assistant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Vice President, </span>issued
an inter-office memorandum to Ms. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Ana </span>Marie
<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, head of the Human Resources Administration
Department, instructing the latter to implement the decision taken by the company
to transfer <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> to "IL Accounting
Department-Premium Section" at Metro Manila to take the place of one Ms.
Paz Francisco who resigned March 30, 1984. The reason given for the transfer,
as stated in the memorandum, was for the company to cut down on its expenses at
its <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
office the function of <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

be </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">assumed
</span>by the Regional Administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> notified <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>
of the foregoing stating that though the corporation was "well aware of
[her] reservation about relocating to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>"
"present circumstances leave the company no other recourse," and
informed her that she was entitled to a “relocation expense” of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> subject to liquidation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Allado</span> wrote the
president of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>corporation
requesting reconsideration of the decision of her transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She reasoned that with the salary she was
receiving she could not afford to live in a highly urbanized area as Metro
Manila, and "more importantly," she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">wrote, she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">has </span>"dependents who are studying
in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City whom <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">she </span>cannot simply leave" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The corporation's president, through <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
denied reconsideration explaining that management had decided to abolish her
item since the volume of business in her station "can more than adequately
be handled by the Regional Administrator." It was emphasized <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">that "the only </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">existing </span>vacancy in the company
suitable at present to [her] qualification will be <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">one </span>at the IL Accounting Department" and that there
"will be no demotion in rank or pay." She <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was urged </span>to "please understand
that [the corporation has] no other recourse but to assign [her] to [the]
vacancy since there [was] no other suitable position where [the corporation]
can accommodate [her] at present." She was assured that "once a
vacancy for a regional cashier arises <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in
the </span>future [she] will be given first priority." There was no
mention of what position <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> was to assume but was
told merely that "the duties and functions [she] will be performing will
be discussed with her in detail by [her] manager on the day [she] report[s] for
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">work." Her </span>"relocation
expense," moreover, was increased to P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was given until <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="5">May <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">1</span>6, 1984</st1:date>
to report to her new assignment on the pain of being terminated from the
service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receiving the letter of denial, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Allado</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> </span>repaired to the corporation's head office in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>in the corporation's legal department, but to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="5">May
 15, 1984</st1:date> she tendered her resignation effective <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also signed a quitclaim and release in
favor of GREPALIFE renouncing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">any </span>claim
or action she might <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">have </span>against
the corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she was
paid gratuity pay and other employee benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1984</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Allado</span> instituted a complaint with the Sub-Regional
Arbitration Branch of the NLRC in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> against the corporation
docketed as NLRC CASE No. <span class="GramE">RAB-I-0307-84, charging illegal
dismissal.</span> <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> contends that during her
meeting with <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> she was told that her new
position is two grades lower than her present status although there would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>no decrease in her salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She continued that <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> advised her to accept her
new assignment even if it be lower in rank, but if she was not amenable to
this, that she <span class="GramE">resign</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>
supposedly told <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> that should she choose to
resign he would work it out for her to receive one-month pay for every <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">year </span>of service as her separation pay
provided she makes it appear that her resignation was voluntary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">she </span>was only given one-half month pay for every year of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She concluded that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">she was "waylaid" or
"trapped," </span>her transfer being an elaborate scheme for her to
resign.</p>

<p class="BODY">To this, the corporation answered that the termination of <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> was not a result of her dismissal but rather of her
own voluntary act of resigning, as in fact she signed a quitclaim in its favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 28, 1986 the labor arbiter promulgated his decision
finding that Rosa <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> was illegally dismissed and
ordered her reinstatement to her former position in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City without loss of seniority rights and for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">the </span>payment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>her
of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> equivalent to one year pay minus the
amount she already received from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>corporation
as a consequence of her "resignation." The labor arbiter found that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>transfer of <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">would </span>cause
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">her </span>and her family
"financial dislocation" and, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">therefore,
"such transfer x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
amounts </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">constructive </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dismissal." The </span>contention of
GREPALIFE that <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> voluntarily resigned was
rejected, the labor arbiter reasoning that <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>
wanted to continue to work <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for the
company, </span>as shown by her repeated pleas, but, forced to accept a
position two-grades lower than her present status and at a place inconvenient
for her, and presented with Valero's representation that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>could work it out for <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> to receive one month pay for every year of service
as her separation pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, to the mind
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the labor arbiter, gave <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> no choice but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
</span>resign and sign the quitclaim for her to receive her separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this decision both parties appealed, <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>
asking for full back wages <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">while </span>the corporation disputed the ruling that complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>constructively dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1989</st1:date>, the NLRC affirmed the decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of the </span>labor arbiter agreeing that:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the circumstances, [<span class="SpellE">Allado</span>]
had no choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hers was one of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">adherence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>She had no better alternative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Faced by the harsh realities of being rendered jobless, she had to
accept the token gratuity being <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> to her even
if it was much less than what was expected by her earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had to make something under the
circumstances or else she would have nothing at hand and with dependents to
support at that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Payment of her
severance pay was conditional, hence, she had to sign the release and quitclaim
papers and thereafter her services were terminated by respondent on account of
‘resignation.’</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"When an employee is being transferred, amounting to a
demotion in rank or grade compared with his actual position and on the pretext
that his present position is abolished, this is certainly an arbitrary exercise
of management prerogative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Allado's</span>] quitting her job is of no moment because under
the circumstances, she had no choice since her present position was deleted or
abolished even before she could accept or object to her transfer to the head
office of respondent company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence the
Labor Arbiter was perfectly correct in ruling that complainant was
constructively dismissed." <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(pp.
33-34, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC modified, however, the award given by the labor arbiter
in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> with
modification by hereby ordering and directing respondent company to pay
complainant full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification
effective from her date of separation from the service on May 24, 1984 up to
her actual reinstatement to her former position or to an equivalent or
comparable position without loss of seniority rights, subject to the three (3)
years limitation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the event that
complainant's reinstatement becomes impractical due to a lawful supervening
event, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, complainant
is entitled to one (1) month separation pay based on her latest salary, in
addition to her <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> as herein decreed, but
deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the benefits she had earlier
received as decreed by the Labor Arbiter, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">GREPALIFE moved for reconsideration pointing out, <u>in</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ter</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">alia</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, </span></span>that there is nothing in the
records which would show that the abolition of the position of Regional Cashier
was contrived to ease or force <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> out of<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>employment, but this was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">For initial consideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
</span>the question of whether the decision of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">NLRC </span>had matured into finality considering that, as private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> points <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">out, </span>GREPALIFE received the order of the NLRC denying its motion
for reconsideration on March 13, 1989 whereas the instant petition was filed
only after fifty-seven (57) days <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> or only on
May 9, 1989.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is basic, however, that
a special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> may be filed within a reasonable
time and there is no time frame fixed by Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (<span class="SpellE">Cubar</span> v. Mendoza, No. 55035, February 23, 1983, 120 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">768; </span>Magna <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Rubber </span>Manufacturing Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>,
G.R. No. 81771, December 29, 1988, 168 SCRA 726).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in Santos v. NLRC, G.R. No. 76991,
October 28, 1988, 166 SCRA 759, We entertained a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
notwithstanding the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">fact </span>that it
was filed only after seven (7) months from the promulgation of the NLRC
decision considering that it has not yet been executed and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>substantial issues raised merited
this Court's attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And after a
careful reading of this case, <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>are of the opinion that the instant
petition has merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Much has been said regarding the transfer of <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>
to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila disregarding the reason for such transfer which is the abolition
of <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span> position of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>Regional Cashier in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That it has in fact been abolished is not
disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also not disputed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that the </span>Regional Administrator had
assumed the function of Regional Cashier and GREPALIFE had not hired anyone in <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span> stead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, there is no serious challenge at all to the decision of GREPALIFE
deleting <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span> item.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, of course, a management prerogative to
abolish a position which it deems no longer necessary and this Court, absent
any findings of malice on the part of management, cannot erase that initiative
simply to protect the person holding that office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">We</span> do not see
anything that would indicate that <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span> position
was abolished to ease her out of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The deletion of <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span> office, therefore,
should be accepted as a valid exercise of management prerogative.</p>

<p class="BODY">But GREPALIFE sought to accommodate <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>ordering her to transfer to a
position recently vacated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether that
position is two grades lower than a Regional Cashier is immaterial because
GREPALIFE could have then terminated <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span>
services when it abolished her position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her proposed transfer was merely an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">accommodation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It is
erroneous, therefore, to conclude that a situation was created by GREPALIFE to
force <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> to resign.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on this premise, however, that <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span>
services could have been terminated after her position as Regional Cashier was
abolished, We adopt by analogy Article 283 of the Labor Code which provides
that in case of termination of employment due to installation of labor-­saving devices
or redundancy, the worker affected shall be entitled to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">a </span>separation pay of at least one (1) month <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pay </span>or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">to</span> at least one (1) month pay for every year of service whichever
is higher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We took consideration of the
fact that <span class="SpellE">Allado's</span> proposed transfer to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Metro Manila would indeed
entail much sacrifice on her part and the finding of the NLRC that the position
<span class="SpellE">Allado</span> was to assume is two grades lower than a
Regional Cashier so much so that <span class="SpellE">GREPALIFE's</span>
accommodation to her is almost illusory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in the interest of justice, <span class="SpellE">Allado</span>
should be <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">entitled to </span>receive
one (1) month pay for every year of service as her separation pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since <span class="SpellE">Allado</span> was
already paid one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service she is only
entitled to the balance.</p>
