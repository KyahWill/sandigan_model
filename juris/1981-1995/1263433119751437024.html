of the respondent Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. CV No. 09699 which,
respectively affirmed <i>in toto</i> the decision of Branch XXI of the Regional
Trial Court of Cebu in Civil Case No. R-22567 entitled "Gloria Chatto, et
al. versus Gotesco Investment Corporation", and denied petitioner's motion
to reconsider the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court ordered the defendant, herein petitioner, to pay
the plaintiff Lina Delza E. Chatto the sum of P10,000.00 as moral damages and
the plaintiff Gloria E. Chatto the sum of P49,050.00 as actual and
consequential damages, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as attorney's
fees, plus the cost of the suit.  These
awards, except for the attorney's fees, were to earn interest at the rate of
twelve per cent (12%) per annum beginning from the date the complaint was
filed, 16 November 1982, until the amounts were fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as found by the trial court and affirmed by
the respondent Court, are summarized by the latter in the challenged decision
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence shows that in the afternoon of June 4, 1982
plaintiff Gloria E. Chatto, and her 15-year old daughter, plaintiff Lina Delza
E. Chatto went to see the movie 'Mother Dear' at Superama I theater, owned by
defendant Gotesco Investment Corporation.  They bought balcony tickets but even then were unable to find seats
considering the number of people patronizing the movie.  Hardly ten (10) minutes after entering the
theater, the ceiling of its balcony collapsed.  The theater was plunged into darkness and pandemonium ensued.  Shocked and hurt, plaintiffs managed to
crawl under the fallen ceiling.  As soon
as they were able to get out to the street they walked to the nearby FEU
Hospital where they were confined and treated for one (1) day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The next day, they transferred to the UST hospital.  Plaintiff Gloria Chatto was treated in said
hospital from June 5 to June 19 and plaintiff Lina Delza Chatto from June 5 to
11.  Per Medico Legal Certificate (Exh.
"C") issued by Dr. Ernesto G. Brion, plaintiff Lina Delza Chatto
suffered the following injuries:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Due to continuing pain in the neck, headache and dizziness,
plaintiff went to Illinois, USA in July 1982 for further treatment (Exh.
"E").  She was treated at the
Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.  She stayed in the U.S. for about three (3) months during which time she
had to return to the Cook County Hospital five (5) or six (6) times.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendant tried to avoid liability by alleging that the collapse of
the ceiling of its theater was done due to force majeure.  It maintained that its theater did not
suffer from any structural or construction defect.  (Exh. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5)"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In justifying its award of actual or compensatory and moral
damages and attorney's fees, the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It has been established thru the uncontradicted testimony of
Mrs. Chatto that during the chaos and confusion at the theater she lost a pair
of earrings worth P2,500 and the sum of P1,000.00 in cash contained in her
wallet which was lost; and that she incurred the following expenses:  P500.00 as transportation fare from Cebu
City to Manila on the first leg of her trip to the United States; P350.00 for
her passport; and P46,978.00 for her expense relative to her treatment in the
United States, including the cost of a round-trip ticket (P11,798.00) hospital
and medical bills and other attendant expenses.  The total is P51,328.00, which is more than the sum of P49,050.00
claimed in the complaint, hence should be reduced accordingly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The same testimony has also established that Mrs. Chatto contracted
to pay her counsel the sum of P20,000.00 which this court considers reasonable
considering, among other things, the professional standing of work (sic)
involved in the prosecution of this case.  Such award of attorney's fees is proper because the defendant's omission
to provide the plaintiffs proper and adequate safeguard to life and limb which
they deserved as patrons to (sic) its theater had compelled the plaintiffs to
hire the services of a counsel, file this case and prosecute it, thus incurring
expenses to protect their interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The plaintiffs are entitled to moral damages, which are the direct
and proximate result of the defendant's gross negligence and omission.  Such moral damages include the plaintiffs'
physical suffering, mental anguish, fright and serious anxiety.  On the part of Mrs. Chatto, who obviously
suffered much more pain, anguish, fright and anxiety than her daughter Lina
Delza, such damages are compounded by the presence of permanent deformities on
her body consisting of a 6-inch scar on the head and a 2-inch scar on one
arm.  The court believes that the sum of
P75,000.00 for plaintiff Gloria E. Chatto and the sum of P10,000.00 for
plaintiff Lina Delza E. Chatto would be reasonable.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submitted before the respondent Court the following
assignment of errors:</p>

<blockquote>“I.  THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING PATENTLY
- INADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY PLAINTIFF-APPELLEES AND IN GIVING LESS
PROBATIVE VALUE TO PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THE CONDITION OF THE
BUILDING, PARTICULARLY THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY ISSUED BY THE CITY
ENGINEER'S OFFICE OF MANILA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II.  THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT ‘THE
CEILING OF THE BALCONY COLLAPSED DUE TO SOME STRUCTURAL  CONSTRUCTION OR ARCHITECTURAL DEFECT,’ AND
NOT DUE TO AN ACT OF GOD OR <i>FORCE MAJEURE</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III.  THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE
APPELLANT WAS GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IN FAILING ‘TO CAUSE PROPER AND ADEQUATE
INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF THE BUILDING.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, respondent Court found the appeal to be without
merit.  As to the first assigned error,
it ruled that the trial court did not err in admitting the exhibits in question
in the light of the ruling in <i>Abrenica vs. Gonda</i><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> on
waiver of objections arising out of failure to object at the proper time.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Exh. “A”, the letter dated June 9, 1982 of Tina Mojica of
defendant-appellant to the Administrator of UST Hospital expressing their
willingness to guaranty the payment of the hospital bills of the
plaintiffs-appellees was not objected to in trial court for lack of
authentication.  It is too late to raise
that objection on appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exhibits "B", “C", "D", “F” to “F-13” are
the hospital records at FEU, UST and Cook County Hospital.  It may be true that the doctors who prepared
them were not presented as witnesses.  Nonetheless, the records will show that counsel for defendant-appellant
cross examined plaintiff-appellee Gloria Chatto on the matter especially the
content of Exhibits "F" to "F-13".  Consequently, defendant-appellant is
estopped from claiming lack of opportunity to verify their textual truth.  Moreover, the record is full of the
testimony of plaintiffs-appellees on the injuries they sustained from the
collapse of the ceiling of defendant-appellant's theater.  Their existence is crystal clear.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exh. “E" is the flight coupon and passenger ticket (Northwest
Orient) of plaintiff-appellee Gloria Chatto from the Philippines to the U.S.
(Manila-Chicago­-Manila).  Certainly,
this is relevant evidence on whether or not she actually travelled (sic) to the
U.S. for further medical treatment.  Defendant-appellant's contention that the best evidence on the issue is
her passport is off the mark.  The best
evidence rule applies only if the contents of the writing are directly in
issue.  In any event, her passport is
not the only evidence on the matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exh. "G” is the summary of plaintiff-appellee Gloria Chatoo's
(sic) expenses in the U.S. in her own handwriting.  Defendant-appellant's objection that it is self serving goes to
the weight of the evidence.  The truth
of Exh. "G" could be and should have been tested by cross
examination.  It cannot be denied
however that such expenses are within the personal knowledge of the witness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exh. “H" is the surgical neckwear worn by the
plaintiff-appellee Gloria Chatto as part of her treatment in the U.S.  Defendant-appellant objects to its admission
because it is self-serving.  The objection
is without merit in view of the evidence on record that plaintiff-appellee Gloria
Chatto sustained head injuries from the collapse of the ceiling of
defendant-appellant's theater.  In fact,
counsel for defendant-appellant cross examined the said witness on the medical
finding of Cook County Hospital that she was suffering from neck muscle
spasm.  (TSN, April 17, 1984, p. 11) The
wearing of a surgical neckwear has proper basis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exh. "I" is the photograph of plaintiff-appellee Gloria
Chatto in the U.S. showing the use of her surgical neckwear.  Defendant-appellant objects to this exhibit
as hearsay because the photographer was not presented as a witness.  The objection is incorrect.  In order that photographs or pictures may be
given in evidence, they must be shown to be a true and faithful representation
of the place or objects to which they refer.  The photographs may be verified either by the photographer who took it
or by any person who is acquainted with the object represented and testify
(sic) that the photograph faithfully represents the object.  (Moran, Comments in the Rules of Court, Vol.
V, 1980 ed., p. 80 citing New York Co. vs. Moore, 105 Fed. 725) In the case at
bar, Exh. "I” was identified by plaintiff appellee Gloria Chatto."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the other assigned errors, the respondent Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court did not also err in its finding that the
collapse of the ceiling of the theater's balcony was due to construction
defects and not to force majeure.  It
was the burden of defendant-appellant to prove that its theater did not suffer
from any structural defect when it was built and that it has been well
maintained when the incident occured (sic).  This is its Special and Affirmative Defense and it is incumbent on
defendant?appellant to prove it.  Considering the collapse of the ceiling of its theater's balcony barely
four (4) years after its construction, it behooved defendant-appellant to
conduct an exhaustive study of the reason for the tragic incident.  On this score, the effort of
defendant-appellant borders criminal nonchalance.  Its witness Jesus Lim Ong testified:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Clearly, there was no authoritative
investigation conducted by impartial civil and structural engineers on the
cause of the collapse of the theater's ceiling.  Jesus Lim Ong is not an engineer.  He is a graduate of architecture from the St. Louie (sic)
University in Baguio City.  It does not
appear he has passed the government examination for architects.  (TSN, June 14, 1985, p. 4) In fine, the
ignorance of Mr. Ong about the cause of the collapse of the ceiling of their
theater cannot be equated as an act of God.  To sustain that proposition is to introduce sacrilege in our
jurisprudence.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration of the decision having been denied
by the respondent Court, petitioner filed this petition assailing therein the
challenged decision on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>“1. The basis of
the award for damages stems from medical reports issued by private physicians
of local hospitals without benefit of cross-examination and more seriously,
xerox copies of medical findings issued by American doctors in the United
States without the production of originals, without the required consular
authentication for foreign documents, and without the opportunity for
cross-examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
damage award in favor of respondents is principally made to depend on such
unreliable, hearsay and incompetent evidence for which an award of more than
P150,000.00 in alleged actual, moral and ‘consequential’ damages are awarded to
the prejudice of the right of petitioner to due process.  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>  3. <span style=""> </span>Unfortunately,
petitioner's evidence of due diligence in the care and maintenance of the
building was not seriously considered by the Court of Appeals, considering that
frequent inspections and maintenance precautions had to be observed by hired
engineers of petitioner, which enjoys an unsullied reputation in the business
of exhibiting movies in a chain of movie-houses in Metro Manila.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the private respondents filed their Comment as required in
the Resolution of 17 May 1989, this Court resolved to give due course to the
petition and required the parties to file their respective Memoranda.  Subsequently, private respondents, in a
motion, prayed for leave to adopt their Comment as their Memorandum, which this
Court granted on 6 December 1989.  Petitioner filed its Memorandum on 10 January 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition presents both factual and legal issues.  The first relates to the cause of the
collapse of the ceiling while the latter involves the correctness of the
admission of the exhibits in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is well-settled that the jurisdiction of this Court in
cases brought to it from the Court of Appeals is limited to reviewing and
revising the errors of law imputed to it, its findings of fact being
conclusive,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

None of the exceptions which this Court has painstakingly summarized in several
cases<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
has been shown to exist in this petition.  Petitioner's claim that the collapse of the ceiling of the theater's
balcony was due to <i><u>force majeure</u></i> is not even founded on facts
because its own witness, Mr. Jesus Lim Ong, admitted that “he could not give
any reason why the ceiling collapsed.” Having interposed it as a defense, it
had the burden to prove that the collapse was indeed caused by <i>force majeure</i>.  It could not have collapsed without a
cause.  That Mr. Ong could not offer any
explanation does not imply <i>force majeure</i>.  As early as eighty-five (85) years ago, this Court had the
occasion to define <i>force majeure</i>.  In <i>Pons y Compañia vs. La Campañia Maritima,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>“An examination of the Spanish and American authorities concerning
the meaning of <i>force majeure</i> shows that the jurisprudence of these two
countries practically agree upon the meaning of this phrase.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Blackstone, in his Commentaries on English Law, defines it as --</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Inevitable accident or casual­ty; an accident produced by any
physical cause which is irresistible; such as lightning, tempest, perils of the
sea, inundation, or earthquake; the sudden illness or death of a person.' (2
Blackstone's Commen­taries, 122; Story on Bailments, sec. 25.)</p>

<blockquote>Escriche, in his <i>Diccionario de Legislacion y Jurisprudencia</i>,
defines <i>fuerza mayor</i> as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The event which we could neither foresee nor resist; as, for
example, the lightning stroke, hail, inundation, hurricane, public enemy,
attack by robbers; <i>Vis major est, </i>says Cayo<i>, ea quae consilio humano
neque provideri neque vitari potest</i>.  Accident and mitigating circum­stances.'</p>

<blockquote>Bouvier defines the same as --</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Any accident due to natural causes, directly, exclusively without
human intervention, such as could not have been prevented by any kind of
oversight, pains, and care reasonably to have been expected.' (Law Reports, 1
Common Pleas Division, 423; Law Reports, 10 Exchequer, 255.)</p>

<blockquote>Cockburn, chief justice, in a well-considered English case (1
Common Pleas Division, 34, 432), said that where a captain --</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Uses all the known means to which prudent and experienced captains
ordinarily have recourse, he does all that can be reasonably required of him;
and if, under such circumstances, he is overpowered by storm or other natural
agency, he is within the rule which gives immunity from the effects of such <i>vis
major</i>.'</p>

<blockquote>The term generally applies, broadly speaking, to natural accidents,
such as those caused by lightning, earthquake, tempests, public enemy, etc.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner could have easily discovered the cause of the collapse
if indeed it were due to <i>force majeure</i>.  To Our mind, the real reason why Mr. Ong could not explain the cause or
reason is that either he did not actually conduct the investigation or that he
is, as the respondent Court impliedly held, incompetent.  He is not an engineer, but an architect who
had not even passed the government's examination.  Verily, the post-incident investigation cannot be considered as
material to the present proceedings.  What is significant is the finding of the trial court, affirmed by the
respondent Court, that the collapse was due to construction defects.  There was no evidence offered to overturn
this finding.  The building was
constructed barely four (4) years prior to the accident in question.  It was not shown that any of the causes
denominated as <i>force majeure</i> obtained immediately before or at the time
of the collapse of the ceiling.  Such
defects could have been easily discovered if only petitioner exercised due
diligence and care in keeping and maintaining the premises.  But as disclosed by the testimony of Mr.Ong,
there was no adequate inspection of the premises before the date of the
accident.  His answers to the leading
questions on inspection disclosed neither the exact dates of said inspection
nor the nature and extent of the same.  That the structural designs and plans of the building were duly approved
by the City Engineer and the building permits and certificate of occupancy were
issued do not at all prove that there were no defects in the construction,
especially as regards the ceiling, considering that no testimony was offered to
prove that it was ever inspected at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The owner or proprietor of a place of public amusement
impliedly warrants that the premises, appliances and amusement devices are safe
for the purpose for which they are designed, the doctrine being subject to no
other exception or qualification than that he does not contract against unknown
defects not discoverable by ordinary or reasonable means.”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This implied warranty has given rise to the rule that:</p>

<blockquote>"Where a patron of a theater or other place of public
amusement is injured, and the thing that caused the injury is wholly and
exclusively under the control and management of the defendant, and the accident
is such as in the ordinary course of events would not have happened if proper
care had been exercised, its occurrence raises a presumption or permits of an
inference of negligence on the part of the defendant.”<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That presumption or inference was not overcome by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, even assuming for the sake of argument that, as
petitioner vigorously insists, the cause of the collapse was due to <i>force majeure</i>,
petitioner would still be liable because it was guilty of negligence, which the
trial court denominated as <u>gross</u>.  As gleaned from Bouvier's definition of and Cockburn's elucidation on <i>force
majeure</i>, for one to be exempt from any liability because of it, he must
have exercised care, i.e., he should not have been guilty of negligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning now to the legal issue posed in this petition, the error
lies not in the disquisitions of the respondent Court, but in the sweeping
conclusion of petitioner.  We agree with
the respondent Court that petitioner offered no seasonable objection to the
exhibits.  More than this, however, We
note that the exhibits were admitted not as independent evidence, but,
primarily, as part of the testimony of Mrs. Gloria Chatto.  Neither were the exhibits made the main
basis for the award of damages.  As to
the latter, including the award for attorney's fees, the testimonial evidence
presented is sufficient to support the same; moreover, petitioner was not
deprived of its right to test the truth or falsity of private respondents'
testimony through cross-examination or refute their claim by its own
evidence.  It could not then be
successfully argued by petitioner that the admission of the exhibits violated
the hearsay rule.  As this Court sees
it, the trial court admitted such merely as independently relevant statements,
which was not objectionable, for:</p>

<blockquote>“Where, regardless of the truth or the falsity of a statement, the
fact that it has been made is relevant, the hearsay rule does not apply, but
the statement may be shown.  Evidence as
to the making of such statement is not secondary but primary, for the statement
itself may constitute a fact in issue, or be circumstantially relevant as to the
existence of such a fact.”<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, and with particular reference to the documents
issued in the United States of America (Exhibits "F”, “F-1” to “F-13”,
inclusive), the main objection thereto was not that they are hearsay.  In its written comment and/or opposition to
documentary exhibits, petitioner objected to their admission on the following
grounds only:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style=""> </span>for being
incompetent evidence considering that the same were not duly authenticated by
the responsible consular and/or embassy officials authorized to authenticate
the said documents.”<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All told, the instant petition is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered DENYING the instant
petition with costs against petitioner.</p>
