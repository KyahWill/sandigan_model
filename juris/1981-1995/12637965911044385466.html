reviewing errors of law that may have been committed in the judgment under

absolute owner of the disputed land, having purchased it in good faith and for <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">value in </span>1969, and counterclaimed for
moral, actual, and exemplary damages.</p>

</span>Defendant King presented the Absolute Deed of Sale in his favor (Exhibit

a Motion to Dismiss, but as the same was not forthcoming, the trial court

the alienation or sale is the registration of the document of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 1 does not show such fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At most, it merely shows that Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Dihiansan</span> received from his co-defendant Ramon King the sum
