Theresa and Ma. <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>, then minors, represented by their mother and

which seeks the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA?G.R.
No. 38069-R entitled “<span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>, <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>-Appellant
v. Victoria U. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>, et al., <span class="SpellE">Intervenors-Appellees</span>.”
The decision brought to this court for review reversed the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (now Regional
Trial Court) and dismissed the petition for intervention filed by petitioners
in the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Special Proceedings No. 1835, entitled “Intestate Estate of
Deceased Enrique <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>,” filed before the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, herein petitioners filed
on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1965</st1:date> a
petition for intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition
alleged that petitioners have a legal interest in the estate of the deceased
Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>; that petitioners-minors are the
illegitimate children of the deceased, begotten out of wedlock by said deceased
and petitioners’ mother and guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>
Norma <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>; that petitioners were conceived and
born at the time when Norma <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> cohabited with the
deceased while the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>already
married to <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>;
that they were in continuous possession and enjoyment of the status of children
of the deceased during his lifetime by direct overt acts of said deceased
having supported and maintained them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners also alleged that they were deliberately excluded from
the estate of Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> (pp. 10-18, Record
on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>,
widow of Enrique and appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of his
estate, opposed the petition for intervention (p. 20, <u>Record</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">on</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Appeal), the trial court issued an order allowing the petitioners to intervene.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, a decision (pp. 24-31, Record on Appeal) was
rendered declaring the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Victoria</st1:place></st1:state>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1966</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> filed a Notice of Appeal from the
trial court’s decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1966</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> filed their Objection to Appeal and Motion for
Execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter motion was based
on the pronouncement in Salazar v. Salazar, L-5823, <st1:date year="1953" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1953</st1:date>, that an order granting support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> is
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 4, 1966, the trial court issued an order (p. 37, Record on
Appeal) declaring that it considers <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>’
motion for execution as a motion for reconsideration and amended the decision
to the effect that it granted the minors Victoria, Theresa and <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span> monthly support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> in the amount of P150.00 payable every
first day of the month to their guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>
Norma <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1971</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered judgment (pp. 19-41, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
reversing the decision of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision
states:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is hereby reversed and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>’ petition in intervention is hereby declared
dismissed, without costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order

<p class="BODY">Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration of respondent Court of Appeals’
decision was denied on <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1971</st1:date>
(p. 53, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1971</st1:date>,
We gave due course to the petition (p.57, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1971</st1:date>, We required the petitioners to file
their brief (p.58, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents, on the other hand, filed their
brief on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1971</st1:date>
(p.85, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1971</st1:date>,
the petition was considered submitted for decision (p. 87, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioners filed a “Motion and Manifestation” praying for the reinstatement of
the order of the trial court to grant the petitioners monthly support during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said order for monthly support granted by
the trial court in its decision of <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="5">May
 4, 1966</st1:date> was terminated in the early part of 1971 (p. 90, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
asked to comment on the manifestation and motion of petitioners, respondents
opposed said motion in view of respondent Court of Appeals’ finding that
petitioners were not the recognized spurious children of deceased <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> (p. 113, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1976</st1:date>,
We granted petitioner’s motion for continuation of their monthly support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>
effective June 1975 until further orders (p. 141, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After an exchange of pleadings by the parties
regarding the order of this court on the matter of the continuation of
petitioners’ support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, and after a motion filed by petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to cite </span><span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
for contempt, private respondents filed a manifestation on January 6, 1978,
informing this Court that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the former
<span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> S.
<span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> was substituted by one of her daughters,
Milagros B. <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, as Special <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>;
and that 2) they have complied with the September 13, 1977 resolution of the
court requiring them to show cause why they should not be dealt with as in
contempt for failing to obey the order to pay petitioners a monthly support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents also manifested their
compliance by depositing with the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Branch 1, a Philippine Commercial and Industrial
Bank check in the amount of P4,350.00 representing the required support until
October, 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another PCIB check in the
amount of P300.00 representing support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> for November and December, 1977 was also
deposited with the trial court (p. 335, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 19, 1980, petitioners, assisted by their guardian <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span> and private respondent <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> Milagros B. <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>,
both parties assisted by their respective counsel, filed a Joint Motion to
Dismiss the petition in view of petitioners’ filing of a “Petition for
Withdrawal of intervention” with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> taking cognizance of the Intestate Estate of
Enrique <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petition for withdrawal was based on a waiver by petitioners of any
right or interest they may have on the estate of the deceased in consideration
of the financial assistance granted them by the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate (p. 371, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition for withdrawal of intervention
was approved by the intestate court on <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1980</st1:date> (p. 369, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), while
the Joint Motion to Dismiss the instant petition was noted by this court on <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1981</st1:date> (p. 372, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The withdrawal of intervention in consideration of the financial
assistance extended to petitioners by the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the deceased
Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> (p. 37, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
is in the nature of a compromise settlement of the instant petition (p. 371, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, however, that the issue involved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">in </span>this case is whether or not petitioners, Victoria, Ma.
Theresa and Ma. <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> are the <u>acknowledged</u>, spurious children of
the deceased, Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>, the Joint Motion to
Dismiss the instant petition cannot be granted, acknowledgment, affecting as it
does the civil status of persons and of future support cannot be the subject of
a compromise (pars. 1 and 4, Article 2035 of the Civil Code) (see <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>, L-19065,
January 31, 1964).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that petitioners are the illegitimate
children of the deceased Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This finding was shared by respondent Court
of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, the
testimony of Norma <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>, supported by that of <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> Vasquez on the one hand as against that of the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> who declared that she and her late husband
were always together and that of Cecilia Waters who testified that Norma had a
suitor named Lieut.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alex on the other,
leads us to give credence to the proof of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
specifically the testimony of Norma that the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
are in fact her illegitimate children with the late Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> (p. 35, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, proof of <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> of the
petitioners to the late Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> is not
sufficient to confer upon them any hereditary right in the estate of the
deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is necessary to be
established by an illegitimate not natural child <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">in </span>order that he may be entitled to <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights under Article 887 of the New Civil Code, is not the fact of his bare <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> but a <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> <u>acknowledged</u>
by the putative parent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This has been
the consistent pronouncement of this Court since the reversal of the
pronouncement in Reyes, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Zuzuarregui</span>, et
al., 102 Phil. 346 by the pronouncement in the case of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>, 113 Phil. 697, 700, 701, 702.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
case, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>“An illegitimate (spurious) child to be entitled to support and <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights from his putative or presumed parents
must prove his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Filiation</span> may be
established by the voluntary or compulsory recognition of the illegitimate
(spurious) child.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Recognition is
voluntary when “made in the record of birth, a will, a statement before a court
of record, or in any authentic writing.” It is compulsory when by court action
the child brings about his recognition. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is true that by their motion to dismiss the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are deemed to have admitted that the appellant is the illegitimate spurious,
not natural child of the deceased Marcos <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such an admission, however, does not entitle
her to inherit from her alleged putative father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>It</u> <u>is</u> <u>necessary</u> <u>to</u>
<u>allege</u> <u>that</u> <u>her</u> <u>putative</u> <u>father</u> <u>had</u> <u>acknowledged</u>
<u>and</u> <u>recognized</u> <u>her</u> <u>as</u> <u>such.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Such</u> <u>acknowledgment</u> <u>is</u> <u>essential</u>
<u>and</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>basis</u> <u>of</u> <u>her</u> <u>right</u> <u>to</u>
i<u>nherit</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being no
allegation of such acknowledgment the action becomes one to compel recognition
which cannot be brought after the death of the putative father.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This was reiterated in the case of Republic v. Workmen’s Compensation
Commission, 121 Phil. 261, where this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
illegitimate (spurious) child, to be entitled to support and <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights from his parents, must prove his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> and this may be done by means of voluntary or
compulsory recognition of the relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For this purpose, the provisions concerning natural children are held
applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There are two modes of acknowledgment provided in the New Civil
Code:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>one, by the voluntary recognition
by the putative parent made in the record of birth, a statement before the
court of record, or in any authentic writing (Art. 278, New Civil Code) and
two, by compulsory recognition under Article 283 of the same law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Were the petitioners voluntarily recognized by the late Enrique
M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> as his illegitimate spurious children?</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence as required by Article 278 which proves that
the petitioners were recognized by the deceased during his lifetime as his
spurious children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners’
records of birth, although in the name of Enrique <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>,
were not signed by the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was
no authentic writing presented nor any statement in a court of record which
would prove that the petitioners were recognized by the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to compulsory recognition, Article 283 enumerates the
cases where the father is obliged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">recognize </span>the child as his,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) in cases of rape, abduction
of seduction, when the period of the offense coincides more or less with that
of the conception; b) when the child is in continuous possession of the status
of a child of the alleged father by the direct acts of the latter or his
family; c) when the child was conceived during the time when the mother
cohabited with the supposed father; d) when the child has in his favor any evidence
or proof that the defendant is his father.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grounds relied upon by petitioners for compelling the heirs
of <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> to recognize them as the heirs of the
deceased were the alleged possession by the petitioners of the status of
recognized illegitimate spurious children and that they were conceived at the
time when their mother cohabited with the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the petitioners were still minors at
the time of the death of Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>, the
action for compulsory recognition was correctly filed by petitioners’ guardian <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">litem</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>and mother, Norma <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as correctly pointed out by
respondent appellate court, since the recognition sought in the case is
compulsory, strictness in the application of the rules applies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with respondent appellate court that
the evidence presented by petitioners failed to satisfy the high standard of
proof required for the success of their action for compulsory recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court held:</p>

<blockquote>“The combined testimony of Norma <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>
and her witness <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> Vasquez insofar as the issue
of recognition is concerned tends to show that Norma was kept by the late
Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> as his mistress first in the house
of <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> and then in a house supposedly rented
from one Lacuna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this Lacuna was not
even presented to testify in support of the claim of Norma and <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> that <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> rented his
house for Norma.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, according to Norma
and <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>
visited Norma some twice a week in the house where she kept her as his mistress;
that <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> paid the hospital bills for the delivery
of the two younger children of Norma.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">, </span>according to <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> herself, it was not <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>
who personally paid the hospital bills but he gave the money for the payment of
the hospital bills to <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> and he requested her
to pay the money to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
only shows that <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> was hiding his identity as
the father of the children of Norma, an act which is inconsistent with
recognizing such children as his own.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If Enrique did not want to hide being the father of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> who were born at the <span class="SpellE">Ortañez</span>
hospital, there was no need <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>him
to ask <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> to pay the hospital bill of Norma for

children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is not even any proof

the liberal view that has found <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">its way </span>into
our statute books, is true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, the
rule of liberality enunciated therein applied only to cases involving <u>voluntary</u>

compulsory recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Upon the second point, whether a voluntary acknowledgment may be
done incidentally in a public document, a distinction must be made between the
two kinds of acknowledgment:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
voluntary, and (2) compulsory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>In</u>

<blockquote>“In actions to compel the alleged father to acknowledge his natural
child, based upon recognition in an indubitable writing, article 135, par. 1<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">, </span>of the Civil Code, requires that the
father must ‘expressly recognize his paternity.’ This provision has been
strictly construed by Spanish and Philippine jurisprudence against the alleged
natural child.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the Sentence of
July 5, 1906, the Supreme Tribunal of Spain held in an action to compel
acknowledgment under article 135, that a mere allusion, more or less clear, by
the alleged father to his supposed child, if there is no express recognition of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>his paternity, is not sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">n </span>the

that same Tribunal declared that there should be an indubitable documentary
proof or uninterrupted possession of the status of a natural child, excluding
deductions and conjectures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to
Philippine cases, the same rule has been adhered to in several decisions by
this court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
vs. De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, 4 Phil., 746, an action was filed to
compel recognition of a natural child, based in part on a letter of defendant
telling the mother of his affection toward her and asking her to take care of
the child.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This court held that the
letter did not expressly recognize the child, under article 135.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>, 5 Phil. 1, the alleged father wrote the
child a letter advising him how to conduct himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This court held that the letter did not
