Mandatory review of the decision rendered in Criminal Case No. 4337 of 
the then Court of First Instance of Palawan, entitled "People vs. Carlos
 R. Maternal, Emilio G. Amar, Jr., Zosimo Igao, alias 'Sosing' and 
Norberto Relojas, alias 'Ovit',” the dispositive portion of which reads:
<blockquote>
  <p> "The information filed is 'robbery in band with murder.’  However,
 the facts as established in Maternal's extra-judicial confession is 
only simple robbery with homicide, there being no more than three armed 
men who appeared to have participated in the commission of the offense. 
 The penalty for this crime is <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death.  
Considering the accused Carlos Maternal's voluntary admission of guilt 
and the provision of Art. 160 of the Revised Penal Code relative to 
quasi-recidivism, the penalty imposable against Maternal who was serving
 sentence at the time of the commission of the offense, is the maximum 
which is death.  However, the Court realizes that Carlos Maternal had no
 intention to commit so grave a wrong as borne out by the fact that he 
was not shown to have joined in the stabbing and the fact that he was 
the one who admonished his companions to desist from the stabbing. </p>
  <p> "In view of all the foregoing considerations, the Court hereby 
imposes upon Carlos Maternal, for the offense as found by this Court, 
the extreme penalty of death with the recommendation to His Excellency, 
the President of the Philippines, that he be extended executive clemency
 for the commutation of this penalty to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. </p>
  <p> "There being no evidence on hand to establish the guilt of Zosimo 
Igao and Emilio Amar, Jr., beyond reasonable doubt, the Court holds them
 not guilty of the offense charged and orders their immediate release 
from confinement." (pp. 29-30, Rollo) </p>

It apepars that about 7:00 in the evening of August 27, 1969, Juan 
Cabasal left his house to go to Panamonton Beach in Barrio Tagpirara, 
Municipality of Brooke's Point, Palawan, to keep watch over his boat and
 sleep there.  He brought with him his radio-phono marked "Fujiya", his 
bolo, a flashlight and a blanket.  When he did not return home the 
following morning, his sister Adelaida Cabasal went looking for him.  
Failing to find him, she went to the municipal building to ask help from
 the police.  Likewise, Restituto Cabasal, went in search for his 
brother, Juan, who he knew had slept in a banca the previous night.  He 
went to the Philippine Consta­bulary authorities at Brooke's Point and 
reported the matter.  The Acting Chief of Police sent out two men to 
Panamonton Beach to help look for the missing Juan Cabasal.  About two 
o'clock in the afternoon of August 28, 1969, the search party found Juan
 Cabasal under the sea, already dead, about twenty meters from his 
banca.
</p><p>
The Municipal Health Officer of Brooke's Point, Dr. Domingo Sy Siong, 
conducted an autopsy of the deceased Juan Cabasal and found that the 
latter sustained eleven (11) lacerated wounds in the different parts of 
his body, five (5) of which were fatal and could have been caused by 
sharp edged and blunt edged instruments.
</p><p>
In search for the persons responsible for Cabasal's death, the police 
had two persons in mind, namely:  Zosimo Igao and Norberto Relojas.  On 
September 11, 1969, Acting Chief of Police Francisco Marquez and some 
policemen went to Barrio Tagpirara to apprehend these two suspects.  In 
the course of their search, the peace officers found a hideout where 
they came upon the "Fujiya" radio-phono of the deceased Juan Cabasal in 
the possession of an occupant who turned out to be appellant Carlos 
Maternal, an escape-convict from the Iwahig Penal Colony.  The police 
placed Maternal under arrest and, upon investigation, he admitted that 
he and three others were the ones responsible for the death of Juan 
Cabasal.  He was brought to the Office of the Chief of Police for 
investigation.  He gave a statement which was reduced to writing 
(Exhibit "C") by Pat. Eliseo Crespo at about 11:35 in the evening of 
September 13, 1969.  The following morning, the statement was given for 
him to read and change whatever was wrong with it.  The only correction 
that Maternal made was his prison number which he claimed was wrong.  
Thereafter, Pat. Sunico accompanied Maternal to the Office of Municipal 
Judge Nicolas Feliciano who propounded questions to appellant regarding 
his name and whether the statement, Exhibit "C", was his.  The judge 
then read the questions and answers appearing therein to Maternal, 
afterwhich he asked the latter whether he was willing to sign the same. 
 Maternal replied in the affirmative and signed the statement, Exhibit 
"C".  Judge Feliciano then made him swear to the truth of said 
statement, after which the judge signed it himself.
</p><p>
On the witness stand, appellant Maternal testified that about 10:00 in 
the evening of August 27, 1969, he was at Tanyang Bubog, a place some 
three (3) kilometers from Panamonton.  He was with Virgilio Camus, 
Rodolfo Madera, and Munton Muslim.  They all went out looking for a 
banca to ride.  Virgilio Camus pointed to them a banca, part of which 
was resting on the sand while the rear was on the water.  Camus woke up 
the man who was sleeping in the banca and told him to start the engine. 
 When the man refused, Camus hacked him with a bolo.  Appellant Maternal
 shouted at Camus to stop hacking the victim who fell into the water.  
When Camus and Madera failed to start the engine, they ran away.  He 
(appellant) followed and returned to the house where they were all 
staying.
</p><p>
Further, appellant testified that when he was investigated by the Acting
 Chief of Police of Brooke's Point he was made to sign a document, the 
contents of which were not disclosed to him, much less, was he able to 
read the same.  He had to sign the statement because he would be 
maltreated considering that his hands were tied at his back with a rope.
  When at first he would not sign, the police kicked him and the chair 
he was sitting on fell on its side with him.  On the witness stand, 
appellant declared that the contents of his statement, Exhibit "C", are 
not true.
</p><p>
The accused-appellant seeks a reversal of the decision, claiming that 
the trial court erred (1) in admitting the extra-judicial confession; 
(2) in holding him guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide on the 
basis alone of the extra-judicial confession; and, (3) in imposing the 
maximum penalty of death.
</p><p>
The allegation that he was coerced and maltreated in giving his 
confession, Exhibit "C", was not corroborated considering that Maternal 
had not filed any case whether administrative, criminal or civil against
 the persons who allegedly maltreated and forced him to sign the 
"Salaysay" (Exhibit "C").  And, the claim is belied by his failure to 
present a medical certificate on the injuries allegedly sustained as a 
consequence of the supposed maltreatment made by the police when he made
 the confession.  Municipal Judge Nicolas Feliciano testified that when 
the said confession was presented to him, he read it to appellant and 
asked if he was willing to sign the same voluntarily.  Maternal replied 
in the affirmative and then signed the document, Exhibit "C", which 
discloses incidents in details the police investigators were not in a 
position to know.  For instance, the following appears in said Exhibit 
"C":
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "3.  T - Kailan ka tumakas sa bilangguan ng Santa Lucia kung natatandaan mo? </p>
  <p>
    S - Noon pong ika13 ng Septiembre 1968.

  </p>
  <p>
    S - Dito po sa Brooke's Point.

    5.  T - Saan ka dito sa Brooke's Point nagtira?

  </p>
  <p>
    8.  T - Papano nalaman ni Bert Abiog na ikaw ay takas na bilanggo?

 Abiog na ako ay maraming tato, at dito ay tinanong ako ni Bert Abiog 
kung ako ay bilanggo at ipinagtapat ko naman sa kanya na ako ay isang 
takas na bilanggo na galing sa Santa Lucia, Iwahig Penal Colony.  x x x

  <p> S - Opo.  Humigit kumulang po sa alas dies ng gabi (10:00 p.m.) 
buwan po ng Agosto 1969 ngunit hindi ko po natatandaan kung anong petsa 
ako, si Sosing, si Jovit at si Junior Amar ay nag­punta kami sa aplaya. 
 Noong kami ay dumating sa aplaya ay may nakita kaming nakapundong 
bangka at itong si Sosing at si Junior Amar ay tuloy-tuloy sa bangka.  
Ang ginawa po ni Sosing ay tinaga niya ang atip ng bangka at may taong 
lumundag na galing sa bangka at ito naman ay sinalubong ni Junior Amar 
ng saksak sa harap ng tao hindi ko lang alam kung saan siya tinamaan.  
At noong masaksak ang tao ni Junior Amar ang tao po ay nagsigaw ng 
'Tabang' ng dalawang bases at dito ay pinagtataga siya ni Sosing 
hanggang sa lumubog ang tao sa dagat at dito sinabihan ni Jovit si 
Sosing na tama na yan Sing at kami ay nagtakbuhan na pauwi sa Tagpirara 
na dala ko ang radio ponograph." (pp. 20-21, Records) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The disclosures were made by him soon after his apprehension, leaving no
 opportunity for the police investigators or anyone else to concoct a 
story.
</p><p>
The fact that appellant was not assisted by counsel of his choice during
 the custodial investigation as required by Section 20, Article IV of 
the Constitution does not render the extra-judicial confession executed 
by him previous to the effectivity of the new Constitu­tion 
inadmissible.  In Magtoto vs. Manguera, 63 SCRA 4, the Court said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"A confession obtained from a person under investigation for the 
commission of an offense, who has not been informed of his right (to 
silence and) to counsel, is inadmissible in evidence if the same had 
been obtained after the effectivity of the New Constitution on January 
17, 1973.  Conversely, such confession is <em>admissible</em> in evidence against the accused, if  the same had been obtained <em>before</em>
 the effectivity of the New Constitution, even if presented after 
January 17, 1973, and even if he had not been informed of his right to 
counsel, since no law gave the accused the right to be so informed 
before that date."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is also significant to note that both in his confession, Exhibit "C",
 as well as in his testimony in court, Maternal did not even deny but 
instead admitted his presence during the killing of Juan Cabasal, 
although he tried to exculpate himself from liability by saying that it 
was his three companions who killed Juan Cabasal.
</p><p>
The rule on confession is that "the declaration of an accused expressly 
acknowledging his guilt of the crime charged, maybe given in evidence 
against him" (Sec. 29, Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court).  If the same 
is made freely and voluntarily, the confession constitutes an evidence 
of a high order since it is supported by the strong presumption "that no
 person of normal mind will deliberately and knowingly confess himself 
to be the perpetrator of a crime unless prompted by truth and conscience
 (US vs. de los Santos, 24 Phil. 329)." In a later case, the Court ruled
 that "a confession is admissible as evidence, and it is presumed to be 
voluntary until the contrary is shown.  Before a confession can be set 
aside, both the confession and the reasons or motives given for its 
repudiation should be carefully scrutinized.  It would be unsound 
practice for the court to disregard the confession of an accused simply 
because the accused repudiates it during the trial (People vs. Dorado, 
30 SCRA 53.)."
</p><p>
We find no reason to disregard and set aside the confession, Exhibit 
"C", given by appellant Carlos Maternal.  The fact that the two other 
accused, Emilio Amar, Jr. and Zosimo Igao (Norberto Relojas has remained
 atlarge), were acquitted because they had no confession, writing or 
otherwise, only shows that the police in this case did not coerce and/or
 force appellant Maternal to sign one.  For, if he were coerced, and/or 
intimidated into giving and signing his statement, Exhibit "C", then 
said defendants Amar and Igao would also have been forced to execute 
their confessions.  Otherwise stated, this fact gives Us additional 
reason to believe that Maternal gave and signed his statement freely and
 voluntarily.
</p><p>
The trial court correctly found the accused-appellant guilty of the 
crime charged and in imposing the maximum penalty because he committed 
this crime during service of penalty imposed for another previous 
offense (Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code).  However, for lack of 
necessary votes the penalty is reduced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED and appellant Carlos R. Maternal is hereby sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Juan Cabasal in the sum of P30,000.00.  With costs.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Fernando, C.J., Makasiar, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, 
Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Escolin, Gutierrez, Jr., De la Fuente,</em> and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J.</em>, no part.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, J</em>., vote for the death penalty.
