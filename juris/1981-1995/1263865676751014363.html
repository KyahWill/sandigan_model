a plan to rob <span class="SpellE">Calixtra</span> <span class="SpellE">Calubag</span>,
a 72 year old widow whose house was located around 35 or 50 meters distance
from that of <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span>;
that because of fear that Felix Madrid might harm him, <span class="SpellE">Proculo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Seraspe</span> complimenting Felix Madrid's proposal, then
went with the group at around 12:00 midnight to the nearby house of the victim,

back portion of <span class="SpellE">Calubag's</span> house near the kitchen;

<span class="SpellE">Calubag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Proculo</span> <span class="SpellE">Seraspe</span> being afraid of what the three accused did, run
(sic) away towards his house around 100 meters away followed by <span class="SpellE">Esmeraldo</span> Diaz and <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> <span class="SpellE">Bicog</span>, who like <span class="SpellE">Proculo</span> <span class="SpellE">Seraspe</span>, also run (sic) towards their respective houses

testimony in substance states that in the evening of May 24, 1978 at 7:30

Pedro <span class="SpellE">Antallan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span>, Felix Madrid, <span class="SpellE">Proculo</span> <span class="SpellE">Seraspe</span> and he were in the house of <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span> drinking wine, called <span class="SpellE">Kulafu</span>;
that while they were in drinking spree after having consumed ten bottles of <span class="SpellE">kulafu</span> and at around 11:00 o'clock, when all were already
tipsy, Felix Madrid told the group saying, we will do some robbery, of which <span class="SpellE">Esmeraldo</span> Diaz reacted by saying, 'I will not go with you
because that is a dangerous job’ of which Felix Madrid answered, saying, 'if
you will not go with me, I will kill you’.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Afraid that something might happen to him, <span class="SpellE">Esmeraldo</span>
Diaz then went with the group which proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Calixtra</span> <span class="SpellE">Calubag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were already in the yard of <span class="SpellE">Calubag</span>, the three accused, namely, Felix Madrid, <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Antallan</span> went inside the house through the kitchen door and

assured him not to so reveal the same.<span style="">&nbsp;

valued at more than P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was recovered a week

packed with almost 1/2 of a dress of a fully grown female; that the mouth was
deformed due to the packed clothes as shown and described in Exhibits

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised by the defense questions the credibility of
the evidence adduced by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their first assignment of error, the accused-appellants assail
the finding of the trial court that the accused were positively identified by
the prosecution witnesses contending that these prosecution witnesses did not
actually see the commission of the crime because <span class="SpellE">Seraspe</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bicog</span>, and Diaz acted as look­outs and subsequently
fled due to fear of what will happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They claim that there is no direct evidence on the basis of which
conviction can be had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim that
the only basis of the prosecution is the presence of the accused at the scene
prior to the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted that the prosecution witnesses did not actually
see the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there are
circumstances which establish the guilt of the accused, cited by the
Solicitor-General as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant</span> Felix Madrid, while having a drinking spree with his
co-accused in the house of co-appellant <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span> in the evening of <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1978</st1:date>, proposed to his fellow drinkers that they go

<p class="BODY">The above circumstances lead us to the conclusion that the
appellants were the ones who tied and stuffed the mouth of the victim to do
away with her resistance and then robbed her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People v. Modesto, 25 SCRA 36 [1968] and People v. Ramos, G.R. Nos.
85401-02, June 4, 1990, state that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for
conviction if:</p>

<blockquote>1) There is more than one circumstance;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) The facts from which the inference are derived are proven, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a
conviction beyond reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime clearly
satisfy the above requirements.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other points raised by the accused-appellants reinforce the
finding of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, they
contend that the said robbery was not the first robbery committed against the
victim, the first one having been committed on <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
implication here is that there may be other persons who may have perpetrated
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The possibility they are
trying to raise is that it could be the first robbers who robbed and killed the
deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point raised is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not negate their guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to this claim, the son of the
deceased testified that he last saw his mother alive in the afternoon of May
24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the appellants entered the house
of the victim at <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of the same
day, the inference is that they were the same persons who committed the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be attributed to a
crime which happened on <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants further claim that they do not have any motive to
rob and kill the victim because the daughter-in-law of the deceased is close to
the wife of <span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Friendship or even relationship is not a deterrent to the <span style="">commission </span>of a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither will it stop one from testifying
against a relative in order to bring justice as in the case of Diaz who is a
brother-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Antallan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Absence of reason to rob the victim is further raised in their
claim that the victim is without gainful occupation so that to rob her would be
futile.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the deceased was engaged in business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a sari-sari store; she sold rice and
other commodities and received income from her copra business as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of both <st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>
and <span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span> is denial and alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>
asserts that he was in <span class="SpellE">Malimono</span> at that time with
Arturo <span class="SpellE">Lumancas</span> who instructed him to <span style="">give </span>the cow being taken cared of by
him to Felix Carbon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony was
corroborated by Felix Carbon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bernadez</span>, on the other hand, testified
that he was then harvesting the coconut trees of <span class="SpellE">Gesta</span>
in the latter's farm which was about 3 kilometers from <span class="SpellE">Magtangale</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony was likewise corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Gesta</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">For alibi to prosper, the requirements of time and place must be
strictly met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be established by
clear and convincing evidence that the accused was at some other place and for
such a period of time as to negate his presence at the time when and the place
where the crime was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found
by the trial court, there is no evidence to show it was physically impossible
for appellant to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its
commission (People v. <span class="SpellE">Perante</span>, Jr., 143 SCRA 56
[1986]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacia</span>, G.R. No. 69543, June 14,
1990; People v. Solis, G.R. Nos. 78732-33, February 14, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">In their struggle to destroy the credibility of the prosecution
witness, the appellants point out variations in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Seraspe</span> and Diaz as to the time when they were drinking and
the time when they went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Calubag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies and improbabilities in the testimony
of the prosecution witnesses stressed by the <span class="GramE">appellants,</span>
refer to insignificant details which cannot destroy the credibility of said
witnesses (People v. Bautista, 147 SCRA 500 [1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Dava</span>, 149 SCRA 582 [1987] and People v. <span class="SpellE">Eswan</span>,
et al., G.R. No.<span style=""> 84713, June 4, 1990).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court that community of purpose is
indicative of conspiracy among the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear from the evidence on record that there was conspiracy among
the perpetrators of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conspiracy
exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission
of a felony and decide to commit it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This need not be established by direct evidence but may be proven
through the series of acts done by each of the accused in pursuance of the
common unlawful purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, 48 SCRA 382 [1972]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Laguardia</span>,
148 SCRA 133 [1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>, G.R. No.
80042, March 28, 1990; People v. Asuncion and <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>,
G.R. No. 83870, November 14, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">The next assignment of error adduced by the accused-appellants is
the illegality of their arrest and detention as they claim that no warrant of
arrest was shown nor were they given a copy of the results of the investigation
by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to them also,
when they were picked up, they were not informed of their offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of these allegations, they <span style="">claim that the rights of persons under
custodial investigation were denied to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the case which shows that statements were
extracted after the appellants were arrested.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact is that there was no statement executed by them during their
detention which could be prejudicial to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The matter of non-presentation of the warrants of arrest was not
developed during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an afterthought
brought up during appeal and is not enough to warrant reversal of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found no evidence that the prosecution witnesses
fabricated their story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
ulterior motive which impelled them to testify as they did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, no evidence was introduced by
the <span style="">defense to impeach the credibility <span class="GramE">of prosecution</span> witnesses nor evidence to discredit their
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court held in People v.
Victor, et al., G.R. Nos. 75154- 55, February 6, 1990, that the credibility of the
testimony having remained <span class="SpellE">unimpeached</span>, such testimony
carries great weight in the determination of the appellants' guilt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
