<p class="BODY">As disclosed by the pleadings and the challenged decision, the
antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan Zabella and Anastacio Llenares were co-owners, in equal
shares, of a parcel of land situated in barrio Silangang Mayao of the then
Municipality, now City, of Lucena.  In
the cadastral survey of the said municipality, the lot was designated as
Cadastral Lot No. 4804-D.  This designation
was later changed to Lot No. 5015.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 December 1929, Anastacio Llenares sold his one-half <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(1/2) </span>share in the lot to Ariston
Zabella, private respondent's father.  Subsequently, after due proceedings, the cadastral court awarded Lot No.
5015 to Juan Zabella and Anastacio Llenares in equal shares.  Decree No. 54398 was issued to both of them
and on the basis thereof, Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 43073 was
issued in their names on 28 July 1937.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anastacio Llenares passed away on 27 March 1931 leaving the
petitioner, his only child, as his sole heir.  On the other hand, Juan Zabella died on 27 June 1952 and was survived by
his sister Rosario Zabella and niece Irene Catapat.  On 5 February 1960, Rosario and Irene adjudicated to themselves
Juan Zabella's one-half <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(½) </span>share
in the lot.  This adjudication was
annotated in OCT No. 43073.  Rosario
died on 5 June 1962 leaving, as her only heirs, her children Godofredo, Noemi,
Natividad, Olimpio and Numeriana, all surnamed Zaracena.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 June 1976, petitioner, as the sole heir of Anastacio
Llenares, adjudicated to herself, by way of a <i>Salaysay ng Pagmamana ng
Nag-iisang Tagapagmana</i> (Exhibit "A"), the one-half (½) share in
the property belonging to Anastacio Llenares.  This fact was likewise annotated in OCT No. 43073.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 August 1976, however, OCT No. 43073 was cancelled and in
its place, TCT No. T-27166 was issued for the entire lot.  On 16 February 1977, private respondent
Zabella filed an adverse claim which was duly annotated in TCT No. T-27166.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence of a <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Kasunduan
ng </span>Pagpasukat</i> (Exhibit "I") executed by and between Irene
Catapat and the heirs of Rosario Zabella Zaracena, Lot No. 5015 was subdivided
into Lot Nos. 5015-­A, 5015-B and 5015-C.  Lot No. 5015-A, which comprises one-half <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">(½) </span>of Lot No. 5015 corresponding to Anastacio's share, was
allotted to the petitioner.  TCT No.
T-27166 was thereafter cancelled and separate Transfer Certificates of Title
were issued for each of the subdivided lots.  TCT No. 28170 was issued in the petitioner's name for Lot No. 5015-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the issue of possession, the petitioner's evidence
discloses that since she was only four (4) years old when her father died, her
cousin Rosario Zabella administered the land in question until 1959 when she (petitioner)
placed Rufo Orig as tenant therein.  The
latter worked as such, delivering to the petitioner her share of the harvest
until 1976, when he stopped doing so as he was ordered by the private
respondent not to give the petitioner her share anymore.   Private respondent allegedly claimed
ownership over the property.  Petitioner
further proved that she had been paying the land taxes on the property until
the filing of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, according to his own version, private
respondent and his siblings took possession of that portion of the land sold by
Anastacio Llenares after Ariston Zabella's death on 21 March 1930.  He then converted the same into
riceland.  It was irrigated in 1955 and
he has been paying the irrigation charges thereon since 1960.  Moreover, he and his co-­heirs have been in
possession of the property without interference by any party until "the
present."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court limited the issues to the following:  whether the private respondent had acquired
absolute ownership of the land in question by prescription and whether the
plaintiff's (petitioner) action is barred by laches.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> In
finding for the petitioner, the lower court made the following disquisitions:</p>

<p class="2Q">"'It is beyond cavil that the land in question (then part of a
big parcel) has been registered and titled in the name of plaintiff's father
Anastacio Llenares since July 28, 1937 even as it is now registered in the name
of plaintiff who made an affidavit of self-adjudication on June 22, 1976 being
the only child of Anastacio Llenares.  Anastacio Llenares became the registered owner by virtue of a cadastral
proceedings, a proceedings <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><u>rem</u> that is binding and
conclusive against the whole world.  No
evidence of irregularity or fraud in the issuance of the title has been adduced,
and even if there is intrinsic fraud, the period of one year within which to
ventilate this infirmity has long expired.  It is a postulate in law that ‘no title to registered land in derogation
to that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse
possession.  Prescription is unavailing
not only against the registered owner but also against his hereditary
successors because the latter merely step into the shoes of the decedent by
operation of law and are merely the continuation of the personality of their
predecessor in interest.’ (Barcelona vs. Barcelona, 100 Phil. 251).  On this score alone, defendant's claim of
prescription should fail.  The court also
notes, in passing, that defendant's evidence does not convincingly establish that
he possessed the property publicly, exclusively and peacefully in the concept
of owner.  For one thing, he has not
even paid any realty tax on the property as the property is not declared for
taxation purposes in his name.  The
court is neither impressed with the credibility of defendant's witnesses.  For example, the witness Sergio Dalida
testified that in 1918 the land in litigation was in the possession of Ariston
Zabella (T.S.N. 8-21-84 p. 8).  There
seems to be no truth to this because the property was bought by Ariston Zabella
only in the year 1929.  And then, there
was that other witness Cosme Ranillo who unequivocally admitted during
cross-examination that he was coached by the defendant (vide:  t.s.n. 11-20-­84 p. 24-26).</p>

<p class="2Q">'As regards the Deed of Sale of the property in litigation in favor
of Ariston Zabella (Exh. "1") which is apparently the cornerstone of
defendant's claim over the property the court concurs with the submission of
the plaintiff that after final judgment has been rendered in the cadastral
proceedings, all rights or claims prior thereto are deemed barred by the
principle of <u>res</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">judicata</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">.  </span>Hence
after the finality of the judgment in the cadastral case, the Deed of Sale has
lost its efficacy being <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">functus</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <u>officio</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'With respect to the defense of laches so emphatically and
exhaustively discussed by defendant's counsel in his brief we find this to be
devoid of merit because of the following cogent reasons, viz:</p>

<p class="3Q">'Firstly, the defense of laches was never interposed or pleaded in
the answer filed by the defendant.  Not
even in our most gratuitous moment can we see a nuance of this defense being
asserted in the answer:  It is a rule of
procedure that defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to
dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived.  (Sec. 2 Rule 9 of the Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="3Q">'Secondly, the evidence shows that plaintiff has not been sleeping
on her rights.  According to her she was
dispossessed of the land in 1976.  It is
admitted by the defendant that in 1977, plaintiff lodged a complaint against
the defendant regarding the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">land in
question with the Presidential Action Committee, On Land Problems (PACLAP) as
(sic) Camp Wilhelm, Lucena City.  And
then the instant action was filed in court on July 12, 1977.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">'On the contrary it is the defendant and/or his predecessor in
interest who have been sleeping on their rights, if any.  They did not assert their right of ownership
over the land in question arising from the Deed of Sale during the cadastral
proceedings in the year 1937 or thereabout (sic).  Except for filing an adverse claim on February 17, 1977,
defendant has not taken any step to have the title of the property and its tax
declaration transferred to his name.</p>

<p class="3Q">'Thirdly, as adverted to, a title once registered cannot be
defeated even by adverse, open and notorious possession.  In the same vein, laches, too, may not be
considered a valid defense for claiming ownership of registered land.  Where prescription would not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lie, neither would laches be available (De La
Cruz vs. De La Cruz, CA-G.R. No. 4700-R, Aug. 14, 1950; Adove vs. Lopez,
CA-G.R. No. 18060-R, Aug. 30, 1957)."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">From this adverse decision, the private respondent appealed to
the respondent Court of Appeals, which docketed the case as CA-G.R. CV No.
09853.  He asked the respondent Court to
reverse the RTC because the latter erred:  (a) in not considering the unsullied testimonial and documentary
evidence for the appellant; (b) in appreciating the plaintiff-appellee's flimsy
and insufficient testimonial evidence; (c) in not declaring that prescription
and laches were raised by the defendant; (d) in declaring that the failure to
present to the cadastral court the deed of absolute sale bars the appellant
(private respondent) from proving his ownership over the land in suit; and (e)
in rendering judgment in favor of the petitioner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Decision, the respondent Court upheld the private
respondent's position and decreed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is reversed and another one
entered -?</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-indent:-.25in">1)  declaring defendant-appellant the true and
lawful owner of the 12,501 square meters of land described in and covered by

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-indent:-.25in">2)  ordering the plaintiff-appellee to execute

<p class="BODY">In resolving the appeal against the petitioner, the respondent
Court stressed the fact that although OCT No. 43073 was issued in 1937, it was
only on 26 August 1976 that the petitioner initially moved "to change the
registered ownership" of the property with the issuance of TCT No.
27166.  At that time, petitioner was
already forty-nine (49) years old.  In
short, the respondent Court observed that she allowed twenty-eight (28) years
to pass -- from the time she attained the age of majority -- before taking any
affirmative action to protect her rights over the property.  It thus concluded that "suspicion then
is not altogether unjustified that the inaction was because the appellee knew
of the sale by her father to Juan Zabella (sic)," and that such knowledge
is notice "that appellee had no right over half of the land."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the petitioner's contention that the private respondent is
not only guilty of laches but that prescription had already set in against him,
the respondent Court ruled that the former's evidence speaks otherwise because
after TCT No. T-27166 was issued on 26 August 1976, the private respondent
promptly filed his adverse claim, thereby making of record his interest in the
land.  Thus, neither prescription nor
laches applies against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent also overturned the trial court's finding that
the petitioner was in possession of the property until she was dispossessed in
1976 by the private respondent principally because it was only in the third
quarter of 1977 that she (petitioner) declared the questioned property in her
name, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">had paid land taxes thereon
only for the same third quarter of 1977.  The other tax payments were not in her name, but in the names of
Godofredo Zaracena and Juan Zabella.  The respondent Court opined that "[N]ormally, one who claims
possession in ownership will declare the property in his name and will pay
taxes on it,"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and concluded that the petitioner's claimed
possession "is not possession in law that deserves protection and
recognition."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> On the other hand, it gave credit to the
private respondent's version chiefly because he has been paying irrigation
charges since 1960.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner took this recourse, and raises
the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  Whether or not the alleged sale of a
property by virtue of an instrument which was not filed or registered under Act
3344 and was not submitted before the Cadastral Court during the hearing
thereof may deprived (sic) an adjudicated-declared owner the (sic) enjoyment of

That the petitioner neither declared the property in her name nor paid the
taxes thereon until 1977 is not, contrary to the public respondent's
conclusion, fatal to her cause.  Until
27 June 1976, the property remained covered by OCT No. 43073 in the names of
Juan Zabella and Anastacio Llenares.  The private respondent's alleged claim was not annotated thereon.  There is, as well, no evidence to show that
the private respondent had earlier made any extrajudicial or judicial demands
to enforce his claim on the property based on the so-called deed of sale which
Anastacio had executed on 21 December 1929 in favor of Ariston Zabella, the
private respondent's predecessor-in-interest.  Since the petitioner is Anastacio Llenares's sole heir, the continued
existence of OCT No. 43073 fully protected her rights; and her failure to
declare for taxation purposes the one-half (½) portion of the land pertaining
to Anastacio did not, therefore, prejudice her because the payments of the real
estate taxes by others -- such as Godofredo Zaracena and Juan Zabella, as found
by the public respondent per Exhibits "C", "C-1" and
"C?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">2"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

private respondent neither had the property declared in his name for taxation
purposes nor paid the real estate taxes thereon.  All that he paid, and this was only beginning in 1960, were the irrigation
charges.  And yet, the respondent Court
resolved the issue in his favor.  This
palpable inconsistency on the part of the Court of Appeals defies all logic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the respondent Court's conclusion that the
petitioner made no move to have the property declared in her name or pay the
real estate taxes thereon before 1976 because she knew all along about the 1929
sale executed by her father to Ariston Zabella, is plain speculation and, as
characterized by the public respondent, a mere "suspicion," thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">"x x x The suspicion then is not altogether unjustified that
the inaction was because the appellee knew of the sale by her father to Juan
(sic) Zabella.  x x x"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Such a suspicion has no basis at
all.  The parties do not dispute the
fact that at the time of Anastacio Llenares' death on 27 March 1931, the
petitioner was only four (4) years old.  The deed of sale was executed by Anastacio Llenares on 21 December 1929,
when the petitioner was only two (2) years old.  Being at that time very much below the age of reason, the petitioner
could not have been expected to be aware of the existence of the said deed of
sale, much less understand its contents.  The evidence failed to show that the private respondent informed the
petitioner of such a sale at any time before the former filed the adverse claim
on 17 February 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.  Secondly, the
respondent Court erroneously applied the rule on prescription against the
petitioner and not against the private respondent.  The evidence conclusively established that at an appropriate
cadastral proceedings, Lot No. 5015 was awarded by the cadastral court to Juan
Zabella and Anastacio Llenares in equal <i>pro-indiviso</i> shares; the
decision became final; and on 28 July 1937, OCT No. 43073 was issued in favor
of Juan Zabella and Anastacio Llenares.   It was only on 17 February 1977, or after the lapse of over
thirty-nine (39) years, that the private respondent, as a successor-in-interest
of Ariston Zabella, took the first legal step -- <i>i.e.</i>, the filing of the
affidavit of adverse claim -- to protect and preserve his supposed right
acquired under the deed of sale.  Unfortunately, however, this move did not produce any legal effect.  An <u>adverse</u> <u>claim</u> under Section
110 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496), the governing law at that time,
referred to a claim of "any part or interest in registered land adverse to
the registered owner, arising subsequent to the date of the original
registration."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> In
the instant case, the private respondent's "adverse claim" is one
based on a transaction which had occurred long before the rendition of the
decision in the cadastral proceedings and the issuance of OCT No. 43073.  This seems to have escaped the attention of
the public respondent which instead concluded that it was the petitioner who
did not take any legal action from 1937, when OCT No. 43073 was issued, until
26 August 1976, when TCT No. 27166 was issued following her execution on 22
June 1976 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the affidavit of
"self-adjudication." This </span>conclusion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

transfer the ownership of the property to her, or protect her rights and

deed of sale executed by Anastacio Llenares in 1929 had lost its efficacy after
the judgment in the cadastral proceedings adjudicating Lot No. 5015 to him and
