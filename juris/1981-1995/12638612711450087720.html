				<BR><STRONG>NARVASA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Presented in the proceedings at bar is the question of whether or
not the omission of the Trial Court to actually conduct a hearing on a motion
for summary judgment is so grave a defect as to render void the summary
judgment subsequently promulgated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question originated from an action brought in the Regional
Trial Court by <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> Agricultural Products, Inc.
against <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span> Development Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By that action, <span class="SpellE">Univet</span>
sought to recover the sum of P31,853.25 -- representing the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">balance</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>of the price of veterinary preparations and products sold and
delivered by it to <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span> from December, 1980 to
July, 1981 in the aggregate sum of P116,925.00 -- plus interest at 12% <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">per annum</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>and 25% as attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To its complaint <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> attached the
corresponding invoices <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(identified as
Annexes A to F, inclusive).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Answer with
Counterclaim, <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">a) ADMITTED -</p>

<p class="NUM">1) the parties' personal circumstances set out in the complaint;
and</p>

<p class="NUM">2) the purchase of veterinary preparations and products thru <span class="SpellE">Univet's</span> sales agent, <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Itun</span>;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">b) DENIED LIABILITY, alleging that -</p>

<p class="NUM">1) due to financial failures, <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span> had
paid <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> in hogs, thru its agent, <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Itun</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM">2) the total value of the hogs delivered to <span class="SpellE">Itun</span>
was P238,349.20 (the delivery receipts being attached to the answer, signed by <span class="SpellE">Itun</span>, but <i>without reference to <span class="SpellE">Univet</span></i>);<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3) it thus results that it
is <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> in fact which is indebted to it in the sum
of P121,424.20 (P238,349.20 minus </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">P116,925.00);<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">and</p>

<p class="NUM">c) SET UP A COUNTERCLAIM for said alleged excess payment amounting
to P121,424.20.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1983</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Univet</span> filed a MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached to it were the affidavits of (1) <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, its Marketing
Director and National Sales Manager, and (2) Winston T. Young, its Credit
Supervisor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The affiants asserted of
their own knowledge that <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> had never authorized <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Itun</span> or any one to accept
payment in kind from <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span>; <span class="SpellE">Carcon's</span>
receipts all show nothing more than deliveries to <span class="SpellE">Noli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Itun</span> in his personal capacity, not to <span class="SpellE">Univet</span>; and <span class="SpellE">Itun</span> in fact had been
discharged from his employment precisely because it had been discovered that he
was engaging in business with <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span>, among others,
for his own account.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for summary judgment contained a notice of hearing,
set by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> on <st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On this date of hearing, however, there was no appearance for <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the
Trial Court did with respect to said motion for summary judgment, was to issue
an Order, giving "defendant ** ten (10) days from receipt (t)hereof within
which to file its opposition, after which the same is deemed submitted for
decision."</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span> submitted its
opposition to the motion for summary judgment under date of <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That opposition was not verified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No opposing affidavits were attached to
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It simply made the claim that:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) trial was needful since the special and affirmative defenses
in the answer did in truth raise genuine issues;</p>

<p class="BODY">(2) it had paid <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> in kind thru <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Itun</span>, but no receipts had
ever been issued by <span class="SpellE">Univet</span>;</p>

<p class="BODY">(3) moreover, there was no detailed statement by <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> precisely showing the debt of P31,853.25 being
claimed in its complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">The </span>Trial Court
then rendered the summary judgment prayed for, on <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In it the Court recited the above stated facts, and concluded that after
examining the pleadings, affidavits and supporting papers filed by the parties,
summary judgment was proper as no genuine issue had been raised as to any
material fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment authorized recovery
by <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> of the amount by it claimed, P31,853.25,
with interest at 12% p.a. from June 10, 1982 (when the complaint was filed)
until fully paid, as well as 15% of the total amount awarded as attorney's fees
and litigation expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">This judgment was, on appeal,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
affirmed by the Court of Appeals in its own Decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The latter decision was afterwards assailed in this Court by <span class="SpellE">Carcon</span>, which in its petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>,
prayed for its setting aside, and for the remand of the case "to the Trial
Court for trial on the merits." This Court denied the petition, by
Resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1989</st1:date>,
"it appearing that only questions of facts are raised in this case and no
reversible error is otherwise shown in the challenged judgment."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Carcon's</span> motion for reconsideration
dated <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="8">August 17, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">1989</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>asks the Court to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">set </span>aside
this Resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion will be
denied for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few words
will however be devoted to the question presented in the opening paragraph of
this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> complied
with Section 3 of Rule 34, which requires that a motion for summary judgment
should be served at least 10 days before the time specified for the
hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its motion, <span class="SpellE">Univet</span> fixed the time of hearing thereof at <st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1983</st1:date> (11 days from date
thereof, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">November 14, 1983).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the defendant did not appear on the date set for hearing, <st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1983</st1:date>, the Court gave it
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">10 </span>days from notice within which
to file opposing affidavits pursuant to the same Section 3, Rule 34, viz.:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"The adverse party prior to the day of
hearing may serve opposing affidavits."</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant filed an unverified opposition and did not submit
affidavits in traverse of those of <span class="SpellE">Univet</span>; and since,
after submitting the opposition, it did not ask for a hearing, or any other
additional relief, it evidently acquiesced to the judge's directive that upon
submission of the opposition, the matter would be deemed "submitted for
resolution."</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of summary judgment is that although an answer may on
its face appear to tender issues -- requiring trial -- yet if it is
demonstrated by affidavits, depositions, or admissions that those issues are
not genuine, but sham or fictitious, the Court is justified in dispensing with
the trial and rendering summary judgment for plaintiff.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The court is expected to act chiefly on the basis of the affidavits,
depositions, admissions submitted by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, and
those of the other party in opposition thereto.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The hearing contemplated (with 10-day notice) is for the purpose of determining
whether the issues are genuine or not, not to receive evidence on the issues
set up in the pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A hearing is
not thus <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">de <span class="SpellE">riguer</span></span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The
matter may be resolved, and usually is, on the basis of affidavits,
depositions, admissions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not to
say that a hearing may be regarded as a superfluity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not, and the Court has plenary
discretion to determine the necessity <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances of this case,
however, a hearing would have served no purpose, and was clearly
unnecessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The summary judgment here
was justified, considering the absence of opposing affidavits to contradict the
sworn declarations of <span class="SpellE">Univet's</span> officials, which
demonstrate that the issues raised in the answer are sham, not genuine.</p>
