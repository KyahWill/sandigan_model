<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Acting upon a
confidential information that a </span>certain "Elmer" was engaged in
drug pushing at T. de Gula <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">St., </span>Marulas
Valenzuela, Major Elias Casimiro, Chief of the Valenzuela Police Anti-Narcotics
Unit dispatched a team composed of Valenzuela policemen, namely:  Cpt. Romeo Martin, Pfc. Pedro Protestante,
Patrolmen Eduardo Pabalan, Wilfredo Lucero and a certain Pat. Garcia to conduct
a surveillance operation in the area.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 16, 1986, at around 8 o'clock in the evening, the team
launched a buy-bust operation against accused-appellant at T. de Gula St.,
Marulas Valenzuela using two (2) P10.00 marked bills.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Mario Capangyarihan, who then acted as a poseur-buyer together with the
confidential informant proceeded to appellant's address at T. de Gula
Street.  Upon reaching the place, the
confidential informant introduced Pat. Capangyarihan to accused-appellant as a
"scorer" of "damo." Pat. Capangyarihan asked for P20.00
worth of marijuana and then handed to appellant the two (2) marked P10.00
bills.  After receipt of the money,
appellant left for a while to get the "marijuana." Later, appellant
entered the yard of the house with a wooden fence and talked briefly to a
certain person (later identified as accused Serapio de Gula) who was seen by
Pat. Capangyarihan handing over something to appellant.  Thereafter, accused-appellant returned and
handed over to the poseur-buyer a plastic bag containing twelve (12) sticks of
marijuana cigarettes.  Pat.
Capangyarihan identified himself as a policeman and grabbed appellant by the
arms.  Pat. Capangyarihan then signalled
his companions to come and help him Subdue the suspect.  At this juncture, Serapio de Gula approached
the police team and told them that appellant is his nephew.  The policemen told Serapio that appellant
was placed under arrest for selling "marijuana".  Since Pat. Capangyarihan recognized Serapio
as the person with <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">whom appellant </span>talked
after receiving the marked bills, Serapio was also arrested.  The two (2) marked bills were retrieved from
the accused-appellant.  Appellant and
Serapio were brought to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Vale</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">n</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">zuela </span>Police Headquarters for further
investigation.  The plastic bag
containing the twelve (12) sticks of suspected marijuana were forwarded to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">NBI </span>for
examination.  Microscopic, chemical and
chromatographic tests was conducted on the seized articles and all yielded
"positive results" for "marijuana".</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Elmer Mapa however, disputes the foregoing
facts.  Instead, the defense maintains
that the facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:40.5pt">At around 8 o'clock in the evening of
July 16, 1986, while accused Elmer Mapa was inside their house with his
co-accused/uncle <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Serapio </span>de Gula
and their chess club members playing chess, two men with drawn guns entered the
premises of the accused's house without permission, calling for accused Elmer
Mapa, prompting accused Serapio de Gula to tell them, "pare, anong
problema, trespassing kayo."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> In
answer, the men identified themselves as policemen and told Serapio not to
interfere.  However, Serapio de Gula
insisted that even if they were police officers they should nevertheless ask
permission from the owner of the house before entering.  In reply the police officers allegedly
manhandled him while one of them entered the house where accused Elmer Mapa
was, pulled him out and brought him to a waiting jeep.  Serapio further testified that the four
police officers who manhandled him were Patrolman Puchero, Patrolman Inciong,
Patrolman Capangyarihan and Patrolman Protestante.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Serapio threatened to file charges against these police officers for mauling
him so much so that said officers likewise arrested him.  Serapio's testimony is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, after Elmer was pulled outside, how
about you, what was done to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.  The policemen left, I was left behind, then
afterwards, the person who manhandled me, when he was leaving, I was able to
remember him and I told him that I was going to file a case against him with
the Napolcom, then that said policeman <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">returned
and he told me, 'Kami pala ang isasabit mo, sama ka na rin'.  </span>That <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">This was corroborated by a defense witness, Antonio
Trinidad.  In his testimony, Antonio
revealed that one unidentified man entered the house and when questioned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by </span>Serapio
de Gula, the man hit the latter with his gun.  He could not do anything, much less the other chess players present
because guns were poked at them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both the accused were brought to the sub-station<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>where they were mauled and forced to
admit the charges against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Serapio remembered Patrolman Inciong going to his cell and
showing (14) tea bags and jestingly said, "Never will you be able to get
out of this jail because we will<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>charge
you with drug pushing and we will use these as evidence against you."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Tarried in jail during the early months of their apprehension,
Elmer Mapa learned that a policeman talked to a certain Dueñas who was earlier
detained for illegal possession of marijuana, that if he wanted to be released,
he must give a substitute or "palit-ulo" in jail lingo.  That upon his apprehension, he learned that
Eduardo Dueñas was later released by the police.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing facts, We hold the accused-appellant
innocent.  The conflicting and
contradictory evidence of the prosecution affirms the weakness of its case
thereby creating reasonable doubt as to his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">guilt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We
</span>find several glaring inconsistencies and contradictions in the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as to engender doubt on the moral
certainty of accused-appellant's guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented only two of the members of the buy-bust
operation, whose testimonies unfortunately did not impress this Court.  On the contrary, it weakens the prosecution's
case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Take </span>for instance

some 9 to 10 meters away from where Elmer Mapa was standing and that he was not
present during the arrest o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">f </span>Serapio
de Gula.  Contrary to his testimony
however, Pat. Lucero testified that when Serapio was apprehended <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by </span>him Pat.

<p class="BODY">The foregoing contradictory testimony of two prosecution
witnesses on who brought the marijuana to the NBI for laboratory examination is
significant.  Is it police aide Carreon
or Pat. Lucero?</p>

<p class="BODY">Carreon never testified on the matter or that the specimen
submitted to the NBI for examination was the same specimen allegedly taken from
the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither was Pat. Lucero's testimony clear on the matter.  Obviously, one of them is lying, Pat. Capangyarihan
or Pat. Lucero.  On such kind of shaky
testimony conviction cannot b<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">e </span>had.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inconsistencies were never explained by the prosecution.  Irreconcilable and unexplained
contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses cast doubt on the
culpability of the appellant and his guilt for the crime charged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As it is, the bungled testimonies of the police officers cannot
be given credence.  We are more inclined
to believe the testimony of accused-appellant that he was a "target"
to be arrested not for selling marijuana but as a replacement for Eduardo
Dueñas who was at the time detained in the Municipal Jail, with accused­-appellant
as the substitute or "palit-ulo" in jail lingo, so that the detainee
could be released.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be noteworthy to mention though, that accused-appellant
was subjected to a drug test to find out whether he was likewise a drug
user.  It is often observed that a drug
pusher usually, if not all the time is also a drug user.  The act of pushing drugs is a means to
support his being a drug dependent.  For
whatever its worth, accused-appellant was found to be drug free.  In the NBI Toxicology Report No. TDD-86-646,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
blood and urine specimens of Elmer Mapa showed negative results for the
presence of prohibited and or regulated drugs.  Though this report was not presented during trial, such is made part of
the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evident falsehood spread on the records before Us creates a
nagging doubt on the culpability of the accused-appellant.  It is sad to state that many innocent people
become victims of physical violence and/or harassment from police officers who
are supposed to be the protectors of the citizenry.  We cannot condone such practices to continue in a civilized
society.</p>

<p class="BODY">While this Court commends the efforts of law enforcement agencies
who are engaged in the difficult and dangerous task of apprehending and
prosecuting drug-traffickers, it cannot, however, close its eyes nor ignore the
many reports of false arrests of innocent persons for extortion purposes and
blackmail, or to satisfy some hidden <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">personal
</span>resentment of the "informer" or law enforcer against the
accused.  Courts should be vigilant and
alert to recognize trumped up drug charges lest an innocent man, on the basis
of planted evidence, be made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug
offenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
