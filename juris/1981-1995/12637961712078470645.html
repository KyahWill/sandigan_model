adequate basis for grant of prayer; that neither documentary evidence nor

acquiring the land, they planted it to various fruit-bearing trees; that from
December 1, 1957, petitioners had possessed the land peacefully, openly and
continuously under claim of ownership, as had their predecessors-in-interest
before them; that before the purchase of the land, it had been declared for
taxation purposes in the name of Maria Nunez since 1932 (Exhibit
"E"); that in 1962, he and Leon <span class="SpellE">Pasahol</span> had
agreed that the property was to be declared for taxation in <span class="SpellE">Pasahol's</span>
name only (Exhibit "F"); that petitioners were informed before the
sale by their vendors that the latter did not claim the land in the cadastral
proceedings Rec. No. 1097, Cad. Case No. 19 because they were ‘totally
ignorant’ of said proceedings, not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">having

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On appeal, the
Intermediate Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's decision and held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In this appeal, the Solicitor General contests, alleging
Exhibit ":A" shows that petitioners' possession began only in 1957,
they could not tack their possession to their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">predecessors-in-interest because of the failure of the latter to lay
claim to the property in question either during the cadastral survey of the
area in 1927 or in the original cadastral proceedings held thereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We do not agree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Record shows Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span>,
original owner of the property, died before herein cadastral proceedings were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">instituted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His </span>heirs who succeeded to his rights over the land lived in a
remote part thereof and only infrequently visited the provincial capital where
the courts were located.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, it is quite credible petitioners' predecessors-in-interest did
not receive any notice of the cadastral proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is nothing in the record to
show that either the petitioners' possession or that of their predecessors was
ever disrupted or interrupted by third-parties, much less by the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners after the sale had zealously
cultivated the property and religiously paid the taxes thereon for a good
number of years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find possession of
the land by both parties was in good faith and that petitioners herein should
not, as a consequence, be held strictly accountable for the lapse of their
predecessors to file a cadastral claim to the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners may tack their period of
possession with that of their vendors <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> to
more than thirty years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Solicitor General points out, however, that under Section
1 of Republic Act 391, as amended by Republic Act 2061, reopen­ing cadastral
proceedings is allowable ‘only with respect to such of said parcels of land as
have not been alienated, reserved, leased, granted, or otherwise provisionally
or permanently disposed of by the Government.' Applying said provision to the
lot in question, it is claimed that registration is not possible as said land
is actually already forest land and/or part of a military reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of this contention, the Solicitor
General cites the Report <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">Of</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>Forest
Guard <span class="SpellE">Crescensio</span> <span class="SpellE">Abuzman</span> to
the District Forester (Exhibit “J”) which states ‘that the area involved is a
portion of former Military Reservation (U S) turned over to Philippine
Government.’ <span class="GramE">Hence, not disposable under any circumstances.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We disagree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The land may have been a military reser­vation in the past,
but no longer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same report Exhibit
"J" relied upon by the Solicitor General goes on to state that this
'former Military Reservation' had already been ‘delimited and classified by our
bureau (Forestry) as alienable and disposable block under the Proposed Land
Classification Project No. 4-C of <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>.' Additionally, the Report in fact recommended the
titling of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the property in the
petitioners' name as the same was no longer needed for forestry purposes and
the government would not be adversely affected.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contributing to the view as to the disposable character of
the land is the approval by the Director of Lands himself of Exhibit
"C", the plan of the land to be registered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such approval would hardly be forthcoming
were the property really non?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">disposable
as claimed by the State.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, We note from the record as well that all the other
adjoining lots (Nos. 443, 447, 446, 438, etc.) were already registered and titled
in the names of private individuals, a circumstance hard to reconcile with the
position of the Solicitor General that registration of the area was simply not
possible." <span class="GramE">(pp. 4-6, Decision-Intermediate Appellate
Court).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In this instant petition,
the petitioner challenges the decision of the appellate court as being contrary
to law on the ground that it held that the subject land is agricultural and
alienable land of the public domain and that the same can be subject to
acquisitive prescription of thirty (30) years of open, continuous and
uninterrupted possession under a </span><u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claim of ownership by the private respondents
as to entitle them to registration and title over the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner maintains
that Exhibit "J" which is the report of the District Forester
recommending approval of the private respondents' petition is a mere proposal
contained in the Proposed land Classification Project No. 4 of <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, which has not
yet been approved by the President of the Philippines; and that unless the
President upon the recommendation of the Minister (Secretary) of Natural
Resources, reclassifies and declares a particular land as agricul­tural or
disposable, its status as military reservation or forest land remains unaltered
and no amount of </span>physical occupation and cultivation thereof can change
it to agricultural land and bring it within the provi­sions of the Public Land
Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it was error on the part
of the appellate court to rule that the land in dispute has been in the open,
continuous and uninterrupted possession of the private respondents for more
than thirty years as to entitle them to register the same and procure a title
thereto because possession of an inalie­nable land, however long, cannot ripen
into private ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, the
private respondents argue that even though Exhibit "J" was a mere
proposal, such </span>proposal had been honored and implemented when the land
in dispute had been recommended for titling in their favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the recommendation for such
titling was made by the same office or branch of the government authorized and
empowered to classify and dispose of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the subject property has no more
use for any government purpose and for which reason, the Bureau did not object
but instead recommended that it be titled in favor of the private
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the Director of
Lands himself approved the plan Exhibit "C" covering the land sought
to be registered.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We find merit in the
instant petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">While it may be true that
as ruled by the appellate court, the private respondents could tack their
possession of the land to that of their predecessors-in-interest as a result of
which they now have more than thirty (30) years possession of the same, the
fact remains that the subject land has not yet been released from its
classification as part of the military reservation zone and still has to be
reclassified as alienable public land with the approval of the President of the
Philippines as required by the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141) and
