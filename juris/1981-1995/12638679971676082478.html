petitioner in favor of private respondent, arising from the loss of a shipment

<p class="BODY">The facts relevant to the present review disclose that sometime
in January 1986, private respondent Panama Sawmill Co., Inc. (Panama) bought,
in <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, 1,208 pieces of <span class="SpellE">apitong</span>
logs, with a total volume of 2,000 cubic meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It hired Transpacific Towage, Inc., to
transport the logs by sea to Manila and insured it against loss for P1M with
petitioner Oriental Assurance Corporation (Oriental Assurance).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a claim by Panama, however, that the
insurance coverage should have been for P3M were it not for the fraudulent act
of one Benito <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Yee Long to whom it had entrusted
the amount of P6,000.00 for the payment of the premium for a P3M policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="1">28 January 1986</st1:date>,
the two barges were towed by one tugboat, the MT "Seminole." But, as
fate would have it, during the voyage, rough seas and strong winds caused
damage to Barge TPAC-1000 resulting in the <span style="">loss </span>of 497 pieces of logs out of the 598 pieces loaded thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Panama</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>demanded payment for the loss but Oriental
Assurance refused on the ground that its contracted liability was for

Tan <span class="SpellE">Gatue</span> Adjustment Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to convince Oriental Assurance to pay its claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Panama filed a Complaint for Damages <span style="">against Ever </span>Insurance Agency-
(allegedly, also liable),<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benito <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Lee Yong and Oriental Assurance, before the Regional

<p class="BODY">On appeal by both parties, respondent Appellate Court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
affirmed the lower Court judgment in all respects except for the rate of
interest, which was reduced from twelve (12%) to <span style="">six </span>(6%) per annum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both Courts shared the view that the insurance contract should be
liberally construed in order to avoid a denial of substantial justice; and that
the logs loaded in the two barges should be treated separately such that the
loss sustained by the shipment in one of them may be considered as
"constructive total loss" and correspondingly compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this Petition for Review <span style="">on</span>
<i>Certiorari</i>, Oriental Assurance challenges the aforesaid
dispositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its <st1:place><st1:city>Comment</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Panama</st1:country-region></st1:place>, in turn,
maintains that the constructive total loss should be based on a policy value of
P3M<span style=""> </span>and not P1M,<span style=""> </span>and prays that the award to Ever
Insurance Agency or Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Lee Yong <span style="">of </span>damages and attorney's fees be set
aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question <span style="">for </span>determination
is whether or not Oriental Assurance can be held liable under its marine
insurance policy based on the theory of a divisible contract of insurance and,
consequently, a constructive <span style="">total
loss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Our considered opinion is that no liability attaches.</p>

<p class="BODY">The terms of the contract constitute the measure of the insurer's
liability and compliance therewith is a condition precedent to the insured's
right to recovery from the insurer (<span class="SpellE">Perla</span> <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> de <span class="SpellE">Seguros</span>, Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. <span style="">78860, May </span>28,
1990, 185 SCRA 741).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether a contract
is entire or <span style="">severable is </span>a
question of intention to be determined by the language employed by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policy <span style="">in </span>question shows that the subject
matter insured <span style="">was </span>the entire
shipment of <span style="">2,000 </span>cubic meters
of <span class="SpellE">apitong</span> logs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the logs were loaded on <span style="">two </span>different barges did not make the contract several and
divisible as to the items insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
logs on the two barges were not separately valued or separately insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only one premium <span style="">was </span>paid for the entire shipment, making for only one cause or
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insurance contract
must, therefore, be considered indivisible.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, the insurer's liability was for "total
loss only." A total loss may be either actual or constructive <span style="">(Sec. </span>129, Insurance Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An actual total loss is caused by:</p>

<blockquote>“(a) A total destruction of the thing insured;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) The
irretrievable loss of the thing by sinking, or by being broken up;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c) Any damage to
the thing which renders it valueless to the owner for the purpose for which he
held it; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d) Any other event
which effectively deprives the owner of the possession, at the port of
destination, of the thing insured." (Section 130, Insurance Code).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A constructive total loss is one which gives to a person insured
a right to abandon, under Section 139 of the Insurance Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 139.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A person
insured by a contract of marine insurance may abandon the thing insured, or any
particular portion thereof <u>separately valued by the policy, otherwise
separately insured</u>, and recover for a total loss thereof, when the cause of
the loss is a peril insured against.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(a) If more than
three-fourths thereof in value is actually lost, or would have to be expended
to recover it from the peril;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) <span style="">If it </span>is <span style="">injured to such an extent as to reduce its value more than
three-fourths;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Appellate Court treated the loss as a constructive
total loss, and for the purpose of computing the more than three-fourths value
of the logs actually lost, considered the cargo in one barge as separate from
the logs in the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it concluded
that the <span style="">loss </span>of 497 pieces of
logs from barge TPAC-1000, mathematically speaking, is more than three-fourths
(3/4) of the 598 pieces of logs loaded in that barge and may, therefore, be
considered as constructive total loss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basis thus used is, in our opinion, reversible error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirements for the application of
Section 139 of the Insurance Code, quoted above, have not been met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The logs involved, although placed in two
barges, were not separately valued by the policy, nor separately insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resultantly, the logs lost in barge TPAC-1000
in relation to the total number of logs loaded on the same barge can not be
made the basis for determining constructive total loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The logs having been insured as one
inseparable unit, the correct basis for determining the existence of
constructive total loss is the totality of the shipment of logs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the entirety of 1,208 pieces of logs, only
497 pieces thereof were lost or 41.45 % of the entire shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the cost of those 497 pieces does not
exceed 75% of the value of all 1,208 pieces of logs, the shipment can not be
said <span style="">to </span>have sustained a
constructive total loss under Section 139(a) of the Insurance Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of either actual or constructive total loss, there
can be no recovery by the insured <st1:country-region><st1:place>Panama</st1:place></st1:country-region>
against the insurer, Oriental Assurance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By reason </span>of the
conclusions arrived at, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Panama</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
<span style="">asseverations </span>in its Comment need
no longer be passed upon, besides the fact that no review, in proper form, has
been sought by it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment under review is hereby SET ASIDE
and petitioner, Oriental Assurance Corporation, is hereby ABSOLVED from
liability under its marine insurance <span style="">policy
