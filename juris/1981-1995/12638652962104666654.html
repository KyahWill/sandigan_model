				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The subject of this petition is a Conditional Assignment of
Rights and Interests over a Foreclosure Judgment entered into between
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Reva</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> and the
original private respondent herein, <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>
Villanueva, on <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1972</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The said judgment was rendered in favor of Villanueva on <st1:date year="1969" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1969</st1:date>, and ordered the
defendants therein to pay her the amount of P35,000.00, with 12% per annum
interest from <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1965</st1:date>,
and other amounts, in default of which the property subject of the proceeding would
be sold at public auction to satisfy the amounts owing her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

This property was a parcel of land located at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> which had been
mortgaged by the defendants to secure the payment of a loan she had extended to
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment was pending appeal
before the respondent court at the time of the execution of the Conditional
Assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of the Conditional Assignment, Villanueva transferred
all her rights and interests in the said judgment to <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>
in consideration of the sum of P75,000.00 to be paid by the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

 1974</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was also stipulated in Par. 3(d) of the agreement -</p>

<blockquote>d)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the ASSIGNOR
shall, as soon as the decision in the aforementioned case shall become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, proceed with the execution of the
judgment and the auction sale if allowed by law of the property subject matter
of the aforementioned case, and the ASSIGNOR and/or her heirs shall as soon as
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">full consideration hereof is fully
satisfied, and if by operation of law shall become the </span>legitimate owner
of the said property, execute a Deed of Sale in favor of the ASSIGNEE or her
heirs, and/or assigns in order to make this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">CONDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS AND INTERESTS permanent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All expenses for such execution and auction
sale and other expenses necessary thereto shall be for the account of the
ASSIGNEE.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner paid the first installment of P22,000.00 on <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1972</st1:date>, and the second
installment of P20,000.00 on <st1:date year="1973" day="7" month="8">August 7,
 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, she refused
to pay the third installment of P33,000.00, which was supposed to be due on <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1974</st1:date>, on the ground that
Villanueva had not complied with her obligation under their agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1978</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed a complaint for specific performance and damages against
the private respondent, claiming that the latter had reneged on her duty to deliver
the property to the assignee in accordance with their agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her answer, Villanueva alleged that it was the petitioner who
had defaulted in her payments and thus given just cause for the rescission of
the agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was authorized in its
Par. 3(h) reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>h)<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If for any reason, any of the above terms and conditions cannot
fully be complied, the same may be considered rescinded by either party, in
which event the ASSIGNOR shall return whatever money she or her heirs may have
received from the ASSIGNEE, and the said ASSIGNEE, shall relinquish any and all
rights which if any she or her heirs may have, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">this contract shall forthwith be considered null and void and without
force and effect </span>whatsoever.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To support her claim, Villanueva presented two letters<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
she said she had sent <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>, the first to remind her of
the third installment that had not yet been paid and the second to tender her
the refund of her earlier payments in view of the rescission of their contract.
These letters follow:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:243.0pt">For her part, <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>
contended that it was the private respondent who had incurred in delay and bad
faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner pointed out that
the motion to dismiss the appeal was filed by the appellants on <st1:date year="1972" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1972</st1:date>, and was granted by
the Court of Appeals in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yet it was only on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="8">August 16,
 1973</st1:date>, that the private respondent filed a motion for execution of
the foreclosure judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">This motion was granted by the trial court on <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The property was sold at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public </span>auction on <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1975</st1:date>, and the certificate of sale was
issued in favor of Villanueva on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
registered on <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1975</st1:date>,
and the period of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">redemption </span>expired
one year later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it was only on <st1:date year="1978" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1978</st1:date>, that the court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>Villanueva's motion, ordered the
confirmation of the sale and a new certificate of title was issued in her name.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioner, the two letters allegedly sent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>her by the private respondents
should not have been admitted in evidence not only because there was no proof
that she had received them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No less
importantly, their genuineness had not been established in accordance with Rule
132, Section 21, reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 21.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Private writing,
its execution and authenticity, how proved</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>- Before any private writing may be received in evidence, its due
execution and authenticity must be proved either:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By anyone who saw the
writing executed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By evidence of the
genuineness of the handwriting of the maker; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By a subscribing
witness.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner likewise submitted that the rescission of the
agreement was improper because it was Villanueva who had violated the contract
by refusing to deliver the property to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, every rescission, even if extrajudicial, requires proper
notice to the other party, and there was no proof that such notice had been
served on her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has deliberated on the issues and the arguments of the
parties and finds that the respondent court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
committed no reversible error in sustaining the trial court<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and dismissing the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was actually arguing against herself in invoking
Rule 132, Section 21, for one of the modes prescribed therein for proving the
execution and authenticity of any private writing is "by evidence of the
genuineness of the handwriting of the maker." This mode must be read with
Section 23 of the same Rule, which says that -</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Evidence
respecting the handwriting may also be given by a comparison, made by the
witness or the court, with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party
against whom the evidence is offered or proved to be genuine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to the satisfaction of the judge.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have made such comparison and find that the signature of <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> G. Villanueva on the Conditional Assignment
(which is not disputed) is similar to the signatures affixed to the two letters
sent to the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
doubt that the agreement and the two letters were signed by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> G. Villanueva.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, their authenticity and execution having been established,
we hold that the letters were admissible as evidence of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is also convinced that the two letters were correctly
sent to and personally delivered at the petitioner’s address as stated in the
Conditional Assignment, were actually received there and later presumably
conveyed to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the signature
of the person who received the first letter closely resembles that of one of
petitioner's counsel as an examination of her pleadings will reveal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
At any rate, even if they were not really transmitted to the petitioner and the
letters were correctly rejected as inadmissible, <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>
would still be bound by her own admission in the complaint, where she made the
following allegations in Par. 8:</p>

<blockquote>a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>A week or so before
</u><st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="8"><u>August 7, 1974</u></st1:date><u>,
defendant demanded from plaintiff the payment of the balance of P33,000.00 of
the consideration</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>e)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of plaintiff's
insistence that the P33,000.00 would be paid only after defendant had obtained
ownership of the subject<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>property and
would thus be ready to execute the corresponding deed of sale, <u>defendant
instead offered </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to</span> return
the amount </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of P</span>42,000.00
already paid to her by plaintiff and have the contract rescinded</u>, clearly
revealing her interest not to recognize the aforesaid contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The last quoted-paragraph is especially telling because it belies
the petitioner's insistence that she had not been notified of the
rescission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By her own words, she has
admitted understanding the letter of <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1975</st1:date>, as informing her that because of her failure to pay the
balance of the stipulated payment, the contract was being rescinded by the
private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As she herself
alleged, Villanueva "offered to return the amount of P42,000.00 already
paid to her by the plaintiff and have the contract rescinded." This is a
judicial admission that the petitioner cannot now disavow.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that a certain degree of delay did accompany the
registration of the property in Villanueva's name, this was not entirely
imputable to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Good faith is presumed
except in the face of the strongest evidence to the contrary, which is not
present here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court also notes from
her conduct that the petitioner is not entirely blameless either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the investment she had made in
the land, having already paid thereon the sum of P33,000.00, we feel she should
have been more <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">vigilant in </span>the
protection of her interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's counsel repeatedly says it was informed of each development
in the sale and registration of the property "later on."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
By this vague statement, which suggests that it was not following up the matter
closely, it would absolve its client of all negligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems to us that in view of her substantial stake in the
property, it behooved the petitioner to see to it that the private respondent
discharged her part of the bargain without delay, especially so since no
specific date was imposed upon the private respondent to transfer the land to
the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>
felt that Villanueva was dilly-dallying, she should have taken steps to make
her move faster (short of refusing to pay the last installment).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge observed, "plaintiff
could very well have paid the whole amount and then substituted herself as
plaintiff in Civil Case No. 10109." But she did not and just stood by,
waiting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>hear of developments
"later on."</p>

<p class="BODY">The sum of it all is that the petitioner, in insisting on the
registration first in her name of the subject property before paying the
balance, was invoking a right not stipulated in the Conditional
Assignment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What was clearly provided
therein was that the balance of P33,000.00 would be paid by her within two
years from the date of the agreement and not later than <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For her refusal to make this payment, the contract was, pursuant to its
terms, properly rescinded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED and the challenged
decision of the respondent court is AFFIRMED, with costs against the
