				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The main issue raised in these consolidated petitions is whether
or not private respondent Maura <span class="GramE">So</span> abandoned or backed
out from the agreement for the purchase of a lot belonging to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span>, so that the
subsequent sale to petitioner spouses Lim is null and void.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The subject lot in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City forms part of the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because it was fictitiously
sold and transferred to third persons, petitioner Maria P. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span>, as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of
the estate and in behalf of all the heirs, filed suit to recover the property
before the trial court of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental in Civil
Case No. 4750.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mariano <span class="GramE">So</span>, the last of the transferees and the husband <span style="">of </span>Maria So, intervened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was decided in favor of <span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span> and was accordingly appealed by Mariano <span class="GramE">So</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Gaw</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
Cheng to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In February
1979, pending the appeal, <span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span> executed a Deed of
Extrajudicial Settlement and Sale of Land (Exhibit "A") with private
respondent for P300,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document
was not yet signed by all the parties nor notarized but in the meantime, Maura
So had made partial payments amounting to P49<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1983, Mariano So, the appellant in the recovery proceeding,
agreed to settle the case by executing a Deed of <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>
of the land in favor of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> was in compliance with the decision in the
recovery case and resulted in the dismissal of his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1983</st1:date>, the heirs <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span> executed another extra-judicial settlement with
absolute sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> Lim <span class="SpellE">Leong</span> Kang and Lim <span class="SpellE">Pue</span> King.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, Maura <span class="GramE">So</span>
demanded from the <span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span> family the execution of a
final deed of conveyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ignored
the demand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, private respondent Maria <span class="GramE">So</span> sued
petitioners-heirs for specific performance to compel them to execute and
deliver the proper <span class="SpellE">registrable</span> deed of sale over the
lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case
No. 8983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">So then
filed a notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>
with the Register of Deeds on </span><st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 28, 1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on the same date, February 28, 1983,
allegedly upon the <span class="SpellE">Jomocs</span>' belief that Maura So had backed
out from the transaction, that the <span class="SpellE">Jomocs</span> executed
the other extrajudicial settlement with sale of registered land in favor of the
spouses Lim for a consideration of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> part of
which amount was allegedly intended to be returned to Maura So as
reimbursement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spouses Lim, however,
registered their settlement and sale <span style="">only
</span>on <st1:date year="1983" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Jomocs</span> as defendants, and the
spouses Lim as <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> alleged that complainant
Maura <span class="GramE">So</span> backed out as evidenced by an oral testimony
that she did so <span style="">in </span>a conference
with the <span class="SpellE">Jomocs</span>' lawyers where she expressed
frustration in evicting squatters who demanded large sums <span style="">as a </span>condition for vacating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged the lack of signatures of four
of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span> and Maura <span class="GramE">So</span>
herself as well as the lack of notarization.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, finding that there was no sufficient evidence to
show complainant-respondents’ withdrawal from the sale, concluded that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the case is one of double sale; (2) the
spouses-<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> are registrants <span style="">in </span>bad faith who registered their
questioned <span style="">deed of sale long after the
notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>
of Civil Case No. 8983 was recorded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal, the trial
court decision was affirmed except for the award of moral and exemplary damages
and attorney's fees and expenses for litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, these petitions.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' allegation that the contract of sale by Maria P.
<span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span> with private respondent is unenforceable under
the Statute of <span class="GramE">Frauds,</span> is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners-heirs, in their brief before
the appellate court, admitted that the extrajudicial settlement with sale in
favor of Maura <span class="GramE">So</span> is valid and enforceable under the
Statute of Frauds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of importance to the Court is the fact that the <span style="">petitioners </span>do not deny the existence
of Exhibit "A", including its terms and contents, notwithstanding the
incompleteness in form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The meeting of
the minds and the delivery of sums as partial payment is clear and this is
admitted by both parties to the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, there was already a valid and existing contract, not merely
perfected as the trial court saw it, but partly executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of <span style="">no </span>moment whether or not it is enforceable under the Statute of
Frauds, which <span class="GramE">rule</span> we do not find to be applicable
because of partial payment of the vendee's obligation and its acceptance by the
vendors-heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract of sale of
real property even if not complete in form, so long as the essential requisites
of consent of the contracting parties, object, and cause of the obligation
concur and they were clearly established to be present, is valid and effective
as between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article
1357 of the Civil Code, its enforceability is recognized as each contracting
party is granted the right to compel the other to execute the proper public
instrument <span style="">so </span>that the valid
contract of sale of registered land can be duly registered and can bind third
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant-respondent
correctly exercised such right simultaneously with a prayer for the enforcement
of the contract in one complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds <span class="GramE">no cogent reason to reverse the
factual finding of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals that
private respondent did not subsequently abandon her intention of purchasing the
subject lot</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts reveal an agreement between the contracting parties to
Exhibit "A" to the effect that "the consideration of P300,000.00
or whatever balance remains after deducting the advanced payments thereon,
shall be paid upon the termination of (Mariano <span class="SpellE">So's</span>)
appeal in the case involving the property in question." (G.R. No. 92871, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 123) The finding is supported by substantial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As reasoned by both courts,
even if the sums paid by Maura So were allegedly intended to expedite the
dismissal of the appeal of Mariano So, such payment only indicates interest in
acquiring the subject lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition,
the claim by the<span style=""> </span>defendants-petitioners
that the payments were for the<span style="">
gathering of the several heirs from far places to sign Exhibit "A"
confirms respondent Maura <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">So's</span></span>
continuing interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms of
Exhibit "A” and the actual intention of the parties are clear and no
reform requiring parole evidence is being sought to elucidate the intention
further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The oral evidence offered by
defendants-petitioners to show a subsequent refusal to proceed with the sale
cannot be considered to reverse the express intention </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the two
courts below had definite findings on this factual issue and we see no reason
to reject and reverse their conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners contend
that the trial court and the appellate court erred </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">declaring as void the subsequent deed of extrajudicial settlement with
spouses </span><span style="">Lim </span><span style="">since specific performance and not annulment
of contract due to existence of double <span class="GramE">sale,</span> was the
thrust of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument
is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue of double sale
had to be resolved to determine whether </span>or not complainant Maura <span class="GramE">So</span> was entitled to the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no hard evidence
to show that the vinculum or contractual relation between petitioners-heirs <span style="">and Maura <span class="GramE">So</span> had
been cut-off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, petitioners-heirs
sold the same lot to spouses Lim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case therefore requires us to discern who has the </span><span style="">better </span><span style="">right to the property.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1544 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span>
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Should it be immovable
property, the ownership shall belong to the person acquiring it who in good
faith first recorded it in the </span>Registry of Property."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of this provision, the two courts below correctly ruled
that the spouses Lim do not have a better right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They purchased the land with full knowledge
of a previous sale to private respondent and without requiring from the
vendors-heirs any proof of the prior vendee's revocation of her purchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should have exercised extra caution in their
purchase especially if at the time of the <span class="GramE">sale,</span> the
land was still covered by TCT No. 19648 bearing the name of Mariano So and was
not yet registered in the name of petitioners-heirs of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jomoc</span> (Original Records, p. 80), although it had been
<span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to said heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not having done this, petitioners spouses Lim
cannot be said to be buyers in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they registered the sale on April 27, 1983 after having been
charged with notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>p</u><u><span style="">endens</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>annotated as early as February 28,
1983 (the same date of their purchase), they did so in bad faith or on the
belief that a registration may improve their position being subsequent buyers
of the same lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 1544,
mere registration is not enough to acquire new title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good faith must concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Bergado</span> v. Court
of Appeals, 173 SCRA 497 [1989]; <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> v. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 83208, February 6, 1991)</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the failure of the petitioners to show that the
findings of the two courts below are not supported by substantial evidence or
that their conclusions are contrary to law and jurisprudence, <span style="">we </span>find <span style="">no </span>reversible error in the questioned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are hereby DISMISSED <span style="">for </span>lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals dated September
13, 1989 and its resolution dated April 2, 1990 are AFFIRMED.</p>
