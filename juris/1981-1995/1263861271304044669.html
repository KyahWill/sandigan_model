<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it becomes apparent that the lower court
acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it granted the motion to revive the
case filed by petitioner as plaintiff therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By then (<st1:date year="1973" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1973</st1:date>),
the dismissal order of <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="12">December 15,
 1972</st1:date> had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
thereby beyond the power of the court to amend, modify, reverse or set
aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And certainly, for the court to
entertain and grant said motion to revive the case would result in the setting
aside of the subject dismissal order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, the step available to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioner as </span>plaintiff therein if it
wanted to pursue its claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">against
Alpha </span>was to institute a new action in accordance with the reservation
contained in the order of dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
could not revive the dismissed case by motion or otherwise, as said dismissal,
although without prejudice, had attained finality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">By the same token did the
lower court act in excess of its jurisdiction when it issued the Order of </span><st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January
 16, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> dismissing

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">But while the Order of
December 7, 1973 which granted petitioner's motion to revive case and that of
January 16, 1974 dismissing the case with prejudice are null and void for
having been issued in excess of jurisdiction, the same cannot be said of the
order dated January 22, 1976 which granted Alpha's motion to cancel the writ of
<span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
crucial difference lies on the fact that while the first two orders of </span><st1:date year="1973" day="7" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">December
 7, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and </span><st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January

 15, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the Order

13.0pt"> enforced and implemented it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In other words, the
motion of Alpha to cancel the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> was in
the nature and character of a motion for execution of the dismissal order of </span><st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">December
 15, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the lower court retained jurisdiction to
carry into effect its final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> order of
December 15, 1972 is beyond cavil for while Alpha's motion was filed three (3)
years after the issuance of said dismissal order, the same may still be taken
cognizance of by the lower court in accordance with Section 6, Rule 39 of the
Rules of Court which states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 6.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

A judgment may be executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its
entry or from the date it becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the lapse of such time, and before it
is barred by the statute of limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Indeed, logic and equity
demand that the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> be cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being provisional and ancillary in character,
its existence and efficacy depended on the outcome of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case having been dismissed, so must the
writ's existence and efficacy be <span class="GramE">dissolved.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">To let the writ stand even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">after </span>the dismissal of the case would

</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as if no case was filed at all
and the parties must revert to their status before the litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of <st1:city><st1:place>Olympia</st1:place></st1:city>
that to cancel the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> would result in
Alpha's unjust enrichment does not persuade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alpha has consistently denied liability to <st1:city><st1:place>Olympia</st1:place></st1:city>,
and even assuming Alpha to be liable to <st1:city><st1:place>Olympia</st1:place></st1:city>,
the latter, having failed to properly exercise its right of action against
