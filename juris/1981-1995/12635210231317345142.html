Petition for <em>Certiorari</em>, Prohibition and <em>Mandamus </em>assailing
 the Decision of respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) 
in Cases Nos. AB-4-11054-81 and AB-8-12354-81 entitled Antonio 
Boticario, et al. vs. RJL Fishing Corporation and/or Peninsula Fishing 
corporation, dated November 26, 1982, as well as the Order, dated 
February 14, 1983, denying petitioners' Manifestation and Omnibus Motion
 to dismiss private respondents' appeal.  The dispositive portion of the
 challenged resolution reads:
<blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Decision 
appealed from is hereby set aside and another one entered, directing 
respondents-appellees; (1) to reinstate complainants-appellants to their
 former work, without loss of seniority rights and other privileges 
appertaining thereto; (2) to pay complainants-appellants full backwages 
computed from the date they were dismissed up to the date they are 
actually reinstated; (3) to pay complainant-appellants legal holiday 
pay, emergency living allowance and 13th month pay in accordance with 
law; and (4) to pay complainants-appellants who are entitled to 
incentive leave pay, as herein above determined, according to law. </p>
  <p>
    The claims for overtime pay and premium pay for holiday and rest day are dismissed.
  </p>
  <p> SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This case was originally assigned to the Second division but because of 
the pendency of a lower-numbered case, G.R. No. 63474, entitled RJL 
Martinez Fishing Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et
 al. before the First Division, involving the same petitioners and 
their workers (albeit a different group and not exactly identical 
issues), this case was transferred to the latter Division for proper 
action and determination.  G.R. No. 63474 was dismissed by the First 
Division on August 17, 1983 for lack of merit.
</p><p>
Petitioner corporations are principally engaged in the deep-sea fishing 
business.  Since 1978, private respondents were employed by them as 
stevedores at Navotas Fish Port for the unloading of tuna fish catch 
from petitioners' vessels and then loading them on refrigerated vans for
 shipment abroad.
</p><p>
On March 27, 1981, private respondents Antonio Boticario, and thirty 
(30) others, upon the premise that they are petitioners' regular 
employees, filed a complaint against petitioners for non-payment of 
overtime pay, premium pay, legal holiday pay, emergency allowance under 
P.D. Nos. 525, 1123, 1614, 1634, 1678, 1713, 1751, 13th month pay (P.D. 
851), service incentive leave pay and night shift differential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
Claiming that they were dismissed from employment on March 29, 1981 as a
 retaliatory measure for their having filed the said complaint, private 
respondents filed on April 21, 1981 another complaint against 
peti­tioners for Illegal Dismissal and for Violation of Article 118 of 
the Labor Code, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  Upon petitioners' motion, these two cases were consolidated and tried jointly.
</p><p>
In disputing any employer-employee relationship between them, 
petitioners contend that private respondents are contract laborers whose
 work terminated upon completion of each unloading, and that in the 
absence of any boat arrivals, private respondents did not work for 
petitioners but were free to work or seek employment with other fishing 
boat operators.
</p><p>
On February 26, 1982, the Labor Arbiter upheld petitioners' position 
ruling that the latter are extra workers, who were hired to perform 
specific tasks on contractual basis; that their work is intermittent 
depending on the arrival of fishing vessels; that if there are no fish 
to unload and load, they work for some other fishing boat operators; 
that private respondent Antonio Boticario had executed an employment 
contract under which he agreed to act as a labor contractor and that the
 other private respondents are his men; that even assuming that private 
respondents are employees of petitioners, their employer-employee 
relation is co-terminous with each unloading and loading job; that in 
the same manner, petitioners are not under any obligation to hire 
petitioners exclusively, hence, when they were not given any job on 
March 29, 1981, no dismissal was effected but that they were merely not 
rehired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
On April 1, 1982, private respondents received the Decision of the Labor
 Arbiter dismissing their complaints.  On April 19, 1982, they filed an 
appeal before respondent NLRC, which took cognizance thereof.
</p><p>
In its Decision of November 26, 1982, the NLRC reversed the findings of 
the Labor Arbiter, and resolved, as previously stated, to uphold the 
existence of employer-employee relationship between the parties.
</p><p>
Petitioners resorted to a "Manifestation and Omnibus Motion to Dismiss 
Appeal and to Vacate and/or to Declare Null and Void the Decision of 
this Honorable Commission Promulgated on November 25 (should be 26), 
1982" but the same was denied, hence, the instant recourse.
</p><p>
As prayed for, a Temporary Restraining Order to enjoin the enforcement 
of the questioned decision of respondent NLRC was issued on April 20, 
1983, and on August 15, 1983, the Petition was given due course by the 
Second Division.
</p><p>
Petitioners submit the following issues for resolution:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I        Whether or not the appeal from the decision of Labor 
Arbiter filed by private respondents is within the 10-day reglementary 
period; </p>
  <p> "II       Whether or not respondent NLRC erred in reversing the 
decision of the Labor Arbiter despite the failure to furnish petitioners
 with a copy of the appeal; </p>
  <p> "III      Whether or not there is an employer-employee relationship between the parties; </p>
  <p> "IV     Whether or not private respondents are entitled to legal 
holiday pay, emergency living allowance, thirteenth month pay and 
incentive leave pay."
  </p>
  <p>
  1.       Petitioners, joined by the Solicitor General, contend that 
the appeal filed by private respondents from the Decision of the Labor 
Arbiter was filed out of time considering that they received copy of the
 same on April 1, 1982 but that they filed their appeal only on April 
19, 1982, or 18 days later.  If we were to reckon the 10-day 
reglementary period to appeal as calendar days, as held in the case of 
Vir-jen Shipping and Marine Services, Inc. vs. NLRC, et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 , private respondents' appeal was, indeed, out of time.  However, it 
was clear from Vir-jen that the calendar day basis of computation would 
apply only "henceforth" or to future cases.  That ruling was not 
affected by this Court's Resolution of November 18, 1983 reconsidering 
its Decision of July 20, 1982.  When the appeal herein was filed on 
April 19, 1982, the governing proviso was found in Section 7, Rule XIII 
of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code along with NLRC
 Resolution No. 1, Series of 1977, which based the computation on 'working days'.  The very face of the Notice of Decision itself<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 indicated that the aggrieved party could appeal within 10 "working 
days" from receipt of copy of the resolution appealed from.  From April 1
 to April 19, 1982 is exactly ten (10) working days considering the Holy
 Week and the two Saturdays and Sundays that supervened in between that 
period.  In other words, private respondents' appeal, having been filed 
during the time that the prevailing period of appeal was ten (10) 
working days and prior to the Vir-jen case promulgated on July 20, 1982,
 it must be held to have been timely filed. </p>
  <p>
  2.       Anent the failure of private respondents to furnish 
petitioners with a copy of their memorandum on appeal, suffice it to 
state that the same is not fatal to the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
  3.       The issue of the existence of an employer-employee 
relationship between the parties is actually a question of fact, and the
 finding of the NLRC on this point is binding upon us, the exceptions to
 the general rule being absent in this case.  Besides, the continuity of
 employment is not the determining factor, but rather whether the work 
of the laborer is part of the regular business or occupation of the 
employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  We are thus in accord with the findings of respondent NLRC in this regard.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although it may be that private respondents alternated their employment 
on different vessels when they were not assigned to petitioners' boats, 
that did not affect their employee status.  The evidence also 
establishes that petitioners had a fleet of fishing vessels with about 
65 ship captains, and as private respondents contended, when they 
finished with one vessel, they were instructed to wait for the next.  As
 respondent NLRC had found:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> We further find that the employer-employee relationship between 
the parties herein is not co-terminous with each loading and unloading 
job.  As earlier shown, respondents are engaged in the business of 
fishing.  For this purpose, they have a fleet of fishing vessels.  Under
 this situation, respondents' activity of catching fish is a continuous 
process and could hardly be considered as seasonal in nature.  So that 
the activities performed by herein complainants, i.e. unloading the 
catch of tuna fish from respondents' vessels and then loading the same 
to refrigerated vans, are necessary or desirable in the business of 
respondents.  This circumstance makes the employment of complainants a 
regu­lar one, in the sense that it does not depend on any specific 
project or seasonal activity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The employment contract signed by Antonio Boticario,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  which described him as "labor contractor", is not really so inasmuch 
as wages continued to be paid by petitioners and he and the other 
workers were uniformly paid.  He was merely asked by petitioners to 
recruit other workers.  Besides, labor-contracting is prohibited under 
Sec. 9. (b), Rule VIII, Book III - Rules and Regulations Implementing 
the Labor Code as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  Directly in point and controlling is the ruling in an analogous case, 
Philippine Fishing Boat Officers and Engineers Union vs. CIR<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> , reading:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The Court holds, therefore, that the employer-employee 
relationship existed between the parties notwithstanding evidence to the
 fact that petitioners Visayas and Bergado, even during the time that 
they worked with respondent company alternated their employment on 
different vessels when they were not assigned on the company's vessels. 
 For, as was stressed in the above-quoted case of 
Industrial-Commercial-Agricultural Workers Organization vs. CIR, (16 
SCRA 562 (1966), 'that during the temporary layoff the laborers are 
considered free to seek other employment is natural, since the laborers 
are not being paid, yet must find means of support' and such temporary 
cessation of operations 'should not mean starvation for employees and 
their families'."
  </p>
  <p>
    4.       Indeed, considering the length of time that private 
respondents have worked for petitioner - since 1978 - there is 
justification to conclude that they were engaged to perform activities 
usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of 
petitioners and are, therefore, regular employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  As such, they are entitled to the benefits awarded them by respondent NLRC.
