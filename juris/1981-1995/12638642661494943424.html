has appealed the decision of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial
Court) of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, Branch XII, in
Criminal Case No. CU-7690 entitled "The People of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> <span class="SpellE">Veronas</span>, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, Nelson C. <span class="SpellE">Abala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Asister</span> alias
‘Annie’," convicting him together with the other accused of the crime of
robbery with rape and sentencing them to suffer the penalty of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify jointly
and severally the rape victim, <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, in the sum of P30<span class="GramE">,000</span> and
to pay the costs of the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 20, 1980, at about 7:30 in the evening, <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, a sixty-five
(65) year old widow, was rolling tobacco for a cigar on the bamboo bed inside
her house in the distant barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tubod</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, while her younger
widowed fifty-four (54) year old sister, <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> <span class="SpellE">Mancao</span>, was sitting by the door about five feet away,
watching a "<span class="SpellE">siga</span>" (small fire) which she
had earlier built to smoke the flowering fruit trees in their yard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From where she was seated, <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> saw three men squatting under the <span class="SpellE">pomelo</span> tree which was around three <span class="SpellE">armslength</span>
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although she did not recognize
them, she could see their faces clearly under the full moonlight, prompting her
to shout "why are you hiding there?" <span class="GramE">Thereupon, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">one </span>of the men, whom she later came to
know as <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> <span class="SpellE">Veronas</span>,
rushed at her, pushing her down while pointing a kitchen knife at her.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> shouted
for help and tried to grapple with the man for possession of the knife but she
was wounded on the left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Veronas</span> boxed her, hitting her on the right cheek and when
she again shouted for help, <span class="SpellE">Veronas</span> cut out a piece
of cloth from her dress, stuffed it into her mouth, then tied a handkerchief
over it around her neck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second man,
whom she later recognized as Nelson <span class="SpellE">Abala</span>, kicked her
three times and tied her legs with a piece of rope.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
heard her sister's cry for help but before she could do anything, the third
man, whom the sisters later recognized as Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>,
ran directly toward her, pointing a knife at her mouth, threatening to stab her
if she shouted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abala</span>
tried to stab her in the abdomen but she parried the thrust with her left hand,
causing the weapon to penetrate her left palm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abala</span>
hogtied her with a piece of rope and divested her of her earrings, wrist watch,
spiritual ring, transistor radio, a pair of eyeglasses, money amounting to P500
from a <span class="SpellE">shoulderbag</span> worth P110 and a US$100 bill
hidden inside a money belt tied around her waist, all worth P3,320.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Nelson <span class="SpellE">Abala</span>
took off his pants, stripped <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> of her
underwear and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her against her will
and despite her entreaties for him to desist from his evil design because he
was even younger than her own grandson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> followed suit and succeeded in having sexual
congress with her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Abala</span>, with the use of his
knife, dug a hole under the staircase and under the earthen stove looking for
something and muttering in the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> dialect:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Ingon</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> Annie, <span class="SpellE">baga</span>, <span class="SpellE">wala</span> man <span class="SpellE">lagi</span>." (According
to Annie, she is wealthy, but there is nothing.) <span class="SpellE">Veronas</span>
suggested that he "go and ask <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Annie
</span>where the money is buried." <span class="SpellE">Abala</span> left to
talk to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">someone </span>outside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he came back to the house, the three men
huddled and spoke in whispers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Probably
realizing that they could not get more than what they had already taken, they
left the two sisters who were still tied with ropes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> <span class="SpellE">Mancao</span>
struggled to free herself from her bonds after which she untied her sister <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both of
them went out of their house through a hole in the window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Outside, they saw <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Asister</span>, sitting on a piece of bamboo near the <span class="SpellE">mudhole</span> a few meters away from their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not speak a word and neither did
they.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As their nearest neighbor was
nearly one kilometer away, they proceeded toward the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Barili</span> to report the crime to the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, they went to <span class="SpellE">Cabuangan</span>
to see Dr. <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> Villegas, the Municipal Health
Officer of <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Barili</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>,
for treatment of their wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, a PC detachment headed by Sgt. Cortes combed the nearby towns
in search of the perpetrators of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They succeeded in apprehending them in Ka-<span class="SpellE">ipilan</span>,
Guadalupe, a barrio between <span class="SpellE">Mantalongon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> the following morning (<st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1980</st1:date>), <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> <span class="SpellE">Mancao</span> were summoned to
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">PC </span>headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Mantalongon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, where the
three men were detained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sisters
positively identified them as the ones who had robbed them and raped <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="GramE">an information</span> dated <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1981</st1:date> filed by the Office
of the Provincial Fiscal in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Asister</span> and his
three friends were charged with the crime of robbery with rape and double less
serious physical injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
arraignment, they all pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">During trial, the accused were positively identified by the
offended parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A bus conductor of the
<span class="SpellE">Amadora</span> Transportation also recognized them as the
persons who rode on his bus from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> to <span class="SpellE">Tubod</span>,

 20, 1980</st1:date>, with <span class="SpellE">Asister</span> paying for all
their fares.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abala</span> admitted his participation in the
robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Veronas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
admitted that on <st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1980</st1:date>
at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 p.m.</st1:time>, they and <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> met outside the <st1:place><st1:placename>Lane</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Theatre</st1:placename></st1:place> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">to </span>watch a movie.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
encountered Annie <span class="SpellE">Asister</span>, who invited them to the
South Expressway Terminal for drinks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After four hours of drinking, they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Asister's</span>
house in <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Asister's</span> house, they ate and drank tuba to
their heart's content.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During their
drinking spree, <span class="SpellE">Asister</span> revealed to them his grudge
against <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
because he had taken care of her <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> but when she
sold it for P1,000, she gave him only P20 as his share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Asister</span> induced
them to rob <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>, also known as Emma, because she
had a son working abroad and supposedly had much money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They all agreed to execute the plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Asister</span> guided them
to the house of <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>, but hid himself a few
meters away while his friends entered the house.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>
denied having raped <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>, but the trial judge,
observing how the two sisters testified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">with
</span>utmost sincerity and candor, rendered judgment finding all the accused
guilty beyond reasonable doubt as co-conspirators in the commission of the
crime charged.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Asister</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abala</span>,
represented by different counsel appealed the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Abala</span>
later withdrew his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lone appellant, <span class="SpellE">Asister</span>, alleges
that the trial court erred in finding him guilty as a co?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">conspirator in the commission of the crime </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">robbery with rape and in denying his
motion for new trial.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">His appeal has no

the whole night </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">November 20,
1980) aside from being inherently weak, is not supported by clear and
convincing evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot prevail
over the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses who saw him
at the scene of the crime and the interlocking confessions of his co-accused
who implicated him as the mastermind of the robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was he who led them to <span class="SpellE">Marciana's</span>
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He watched everything that
transpired therein, but made no attempt to prevent the commission of the crime
by his companions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule is
well-settled that in a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all, and each
of the conspirators is liable for all the crimes committed by the other
conspirators.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the conspiracy are liable for the crime, unless there is proof </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>they tried to </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">prevent it.” </span><span class="GramE">(People
