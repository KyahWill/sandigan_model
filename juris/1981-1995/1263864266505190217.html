				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1987</st1:date>,
Police Corporal <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Poso</span> of the Eastern Police District, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Metro Manila, received
information that a certain drug pusher alias "Boy <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>"
was engaged in the sale of marijuana dried leaves along <st1:street><st1:address>Calderon
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, in <span class="SpellE">Calumpang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Del <span class="SpellE">Poso</span> formed a
team composed of Patrolman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Caviso</span>, as team
leader, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Cruz, who with <span class="SpellE">Caviso</span> were assigned the role of poseurs-buyer, as well as
Patrolmen Roberto <span class="SpellE">Pongyan</span>, Henry Molina and Rafael <span class="SpellE">Ranot</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
ordered to conduct <span class="GramE">a surveillance</span> in the place to
verify the report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A week of such
surveillance produced positive results so they decided to conduct a buy-bust
operation to apprehend the drug pusher.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1987</st1:date>
at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 A.M.</st1:time>, the group
proceeded to the vicinity of <st1:street><st1:address>Calderon Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each of the police operatives took strategic
positions around the area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 A.M.</st1:time>, Patrolmen Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Caviso</span> saw the suspect standing near the American Golden
Shoe Factory situated in the same place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They approached the suspect and asked him if they could buy marijuana
leaves with fruiting tops.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The suspect
replied that they could buy marijuana for ten pesos (P10.00).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pat. Cruz then handed a ten-peso bill to the
suspect who in turn delivered to Pat. Cruz one piece of plastic tea bag
containing marijuana with fruiting tops.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="GramE">Upon a pre-arranged signal of Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Caviso</span>,
the other members of the team arrested the suspect who was identified as
Fernando Hernandez y <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They confiscated three (3) plastic tea bags
of marijuana with fruiting tops <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">in </span>the
right pocket of his <span class="SpellE">maong</span> short pants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Hernandez was then brought to the police headquarters together with the
evidence confiscated from him for investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hernandez admitted his guilt and pointed the
source of marijuana to be a certain Edgar, a member of the military.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the dried marijuana leaves with fruiting tops
confiscated from Hernandez was made by Police Captain Nelly <span class="SpellE">Cariaga</span>,
a forensic chemist, who found the same to be positive for marijuana.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, in due course, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was
filed against Hernandez in the Regional Trial Court for violation of Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">4, </span>Article II of Republic Act No.
6425, as amended by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 179, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 21st day of July, 1987, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila, Philippines and
within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused,
without having been authorized by law, did then and there, willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver and give away to another person four
(4) pieces of plastic tea bags containing dried marijuana, a prohibited drug,
in violation of the above-cited law.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Contrary to law."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After arraignment wherein the accused pleaded not guilty and the
trial on the merits, a decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1988</st1:date> convicting the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>the offense charged and imposing upon him the penalty of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> </span>with all its
accessory penalties, to pay a fine of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and
to pay the costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused was ordered
to be credited in full with the period of his preventive imprisonment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The four (4) pieces of plastic tea bags
containing dried marijuana fruiting tops were ordered turned over to the
Dangerous Drugs Board Custodian, NBI, to be disposed of according to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused interposed this appeal alleging that the trial court
committed the following of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO
THE CONTRADICTING TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">II</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE
ACCUSED DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> ERRED IN
CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME OF HIS CUSTODIAL
INVESTIGATION HE WAS NOT APPRISED OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant claims that he was the victim of a frame-up and that not
one of the team members of the police knew his identity prior to his arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the police officers who arrested him is to the
effect that he was duly identified by an informer before they actually
conducted a buy-bust operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
conducted a surveillance of the area whereby they positively verified the
appellant as a drug pusher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution established that at the buy-bust operation the appellant sold a tea
bag of dried marijuana with fruiting tops to Patrolmen Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Caviso</span> for and in consideration of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">P10.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In another vein, the appellant claims that Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Caviso</span> knew him earlier as he was a police informer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If this is so, it must be the reason why the
police officers were able to easily identify him during the operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tea bags that were taken from the
possession of the appellant were found to be marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant failed to show any motive on the part of prosecution
<span class="SpellE">witnessess</span>, particularly the police officers, in
testifying in the manner that they did against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of regularity in the
performance of their official functions has not been overturned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere denial of the appellant that he was just picked-up for
no reason at all and framed-up deserves no credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims that during the custodial
investigation he was not informed of his constitutional rights and that he was
not able to avail of the services of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It appears no extrajudicial statement was taken from him during such
investigation that could have been presented as evidence against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the evidence adduced by the
prosecution adequately established his guilt beyond peradventure of doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the custodial investigation the appellant identified the
source of the marijuana that was confiscated from him to be a certain Edgar who
is a member of the military.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a
lead that the law enforcement agencies should pursue if no steps had been taken
as yet.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> with costs against appellant.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style:italic"><span class="SpellE">Narvasa</span>, (Chairman), Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Griño-Aquino</span>, <span style="font-style:normal">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Medialdea</span>, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style:normal">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
