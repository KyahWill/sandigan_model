As already mentioned, the trial court found that herein two accused, Felix Pecato and Ereneo Peruda, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons, as defined and penalized in Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, and sentenced them to death. After a thorough review of all the evidence on record, we are constrained to affirm, as we hereby affirm, the judgment of the trial court.</p><p>While indeed, "(T)he prosecution has the <i>onus probandi </i>of establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the weakness of the defense does not relieve it of its duty xxx,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the case at bar, we are fully satisfied that the prosecution has established a clear and positive identification of the accused. Luciana Larong and Uldarica Larong, the two prosecution witnesses who were themselves victims of the crime complaint of and subject of this criminal case, and who identified the two accused as among the perpetrators of the crime, never in the main, wavered in their testimonies. From as early as right after the incident, during the police investigation, in the lengthy and thorough preliminary investigation conducted by Municipal Judge Capistrano C. Navallo, and at the trial of the case, these two witnesses-victims readily, positively, and unequivocably identified Arturo Pecato, Felix Pecato, Victoriano Leyros, and Ereneo Peruda as the four persons who entered their home, robbed them of P350.00, killed Felix Larong, and manhandled and pistol-whipped Uldarica Larong on that fateful night ofNovember 1, 1971. They recognized these malefactors as there was a lighted kerosene lamp inside their house that night. The two women were certain of the identity of the four men because the latter were not wearing masks, hats, or anything to hide their identities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Moreover, these witnesses and the appellants are close relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p>On the other hand, the defense tried to attribute the inculpatory testimonies and hostility of the Larongs against the appellants to the "bad blood" that allegedly exists between them. This "bad blood," which is now being foisted by the defense as the motive of the Larongs in falsely accusing the appellants and testifying against them, purportedly arose when one of the accused, Arturo Pecato, now deceased, brother of appellant Felix Pecato and a friend of appellant Ereneo Peruda, testified in a stabbing incident against Jose Escudo, a grandson of the victim Felix Larong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Appellant Ereneo Peruda, on the other hand, claimed that his father was, at one time, hacked by Jose Escudo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></p><p>The proffered motive has not been proven satisfactorily. Indeed, considering that the two witnesses-victims, are closely related by blood to the appellants, it would take much more than just "bad blood," engendered in the way revealed by the defense, to constrain close blood relatives to impute falsely the commission of a capital offense to other relatives which would mean the imposition of the extreme penalty of death. The Filipino psyche abhors such an irreverent and false imputation. This abomination is especially true among rural and simple folks like the Larongs. It is more likely that the Larongs had been impelled to testify against their relatives as a concomitant of their quest for justice. We agree with the trial court that the so-called "bad blood" that allegedly exists between the accused and the Larongs appears as mere illusions, concocted by them in a desperate but vain effort to be extricated from the crushing wheels of justice. Even defense witness Vicenta Pelajes Pecato in her testimony admitted that if there was indeed an ill-will between them and the Larongs, the victim, Felix Larong, endeavored to patch things up by admonishing his grandson, who was allegedly the source of the rift.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Thus it is shown that the claim of the defense on this score is, at best, flimsy.</p><p>It is a rule well-settled in this jurisdiction that alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification by the prosecution's witnesses of the accused as the perpetrators of the crime especially when there was no physical impossibility for the accused to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The rule holds more true where the accused is positively identified by one who has no reason to charge falsely the accused with an offense that is punishable with death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></p><p>The alibi presented by accused Felix Pecato is even more dubious and weak because it was attempted to be established mainly by the appellant himself and his mother, Vicente Pelajes Pecato, and not by third persons "who would, in the natural order of things, be best to support the tendered alibi."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> In <em>People v. Romero</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> we ruled that the testimony of a mother corroborating her son's alibi scarcely merits any probative value. <em>It is undeniably tainted with bias for it springs from the natural desire of a mother to exculpate her son from criminal liability</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Further, "(a)libi is at best a weak defense and easy of fabrication especially between parents and children, relatives, and even those not so related."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></p><p>More importantly, however, from the testimonies of the witnesses, both for the prosecution as well as for the defense, it has been proven that the two appellants, Felix Pecato and Ereneo Peruda, reside in places very near the scene of the crime,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> In fact, it would only take them less than a two-hour trek from either place to the house of the victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Thus, there was no physical impossibility for the appellants to be at the scene of the crime on the night of November 1, 1971. But above all, the defense was not able to rebut the positive identification by Luciana Larong and Uldarica Larong of the two appellants as among the four heavily armed men who shot and killed Felix Larong, robbed them of P350.00, and mauled Uldarica, inflicting physical injuries in the different parts of her body.</p><p>The crime committed by the accused is Robbery with Homicide as defined and penalized under Article 294 (1), of the Revised Penal Code. Felix Larong was shot to death during the robbery, We have repeatedly held that: <em>(A)s long as homicide resulted during or because of the robbery, even if the killing is by mere accident, robbery with homicide is committed; it is only the result obtained, without reference or distinction as to the circumstances, causes, modes or persons intervening in the commission of the crime that has to be taken into consideration.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> <em>Further, whenever a homicide has been committed as a consequence of or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took part as principals in the commission of the crime are also guilty as principals in the special complex crime of robbery with homicide although they did not actually take part in the homicide unless it clearly appeared that they endeavored to prevent the homicide.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In this instance, the evidence on record is bereft of any showing that any of the accused tried to prevent the killing of Felix Larong. What is shown instead is that they merely stood watching and did nothing when one of their companions shot the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Additionally, the term "homicide" in robbery with homicide should be understood as a generic term and includes murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></p><p>To determine the propriety of the penalty imposed by the trial court on the accused for the crime they committed, the circumstances attendant to the commission of the crime must be considered. While the Information alleges the presence of the aggravating circumstances of treachery, insult or disregard of rank, in band, abuse of superior strength, and nighttime, the decision under review found the attendance of treachery, disregard of rank, in band, abuse of superior strength, and nighttime.</p><p>The trial court is correct in ruling that there was treachery in the commission of the crime. Felix Larong was shot to death while he was lying face down on the floor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> without any warning and thus was not able to defend himself at all.</p><p>The aggravating circumstances of in band, abuse of superior strength, and nighttime were likewise present in the commission of the crime. The robbers, numbering four were all armed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Felix Larong, who was already 70 years old on November 1, 1971, was shot and killed by one of the robbers all of whom were younger and physically stronger. The robbers likewise especially sought nocturnity in committing the crime. This is shown by their act of providing themselves with flashlights<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><strong></strong> which they used in illuminating the interior of the Larong's home after they had gained entrance therein.</p><p>Additionally, the aggravating circustance of dwelling is also present in this case inasmuch as the crime took place and was committed by the accused in the house of the victims, We have held that dwelling is an aggravating circustance in the crime of robbery with homicide<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> as the authors thereof could have very well committed the crime without the need of violating the domicile of the victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> </p><p>The aggravating circumstance of disregard of rank cannot, however, be appreciated in this case. Disregard of rank finds no application in robbery with homicide, a crime primarily against propery and not against persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> </p><p>The crime of robbery with homicide is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death. This case being attended by the generic aggravating circumstances of theachery, in band, abuse of superior stenght, nuctority, and dwelling without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same, and observing the provisions of Article 63, second paragraph, of the Revise Penal Code, the penalty that must be imposed on the two appellants, Felix Pecato and Ereneo Peruda, should be, as correctly meted out by the trial court, death. However, pursuant to Section 19 (1), Article III, Bill of Rights, of 1987 Constitution, the death penalty has already been abolished. Thus, the penalty imposable on the accused is only <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p><p>Parenthetically, the observation by the People in its Brief for the Appellee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> that the trial court should not have mentioned Article 2969 of the Revised Penal Code in its decision, is well taken. As early as in the case of <em>People vs. Apduhan,</em> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> this Court had the occasion to state that the special aggravating circumstance of "use of unlicensed firearm" mentioned in Article 296, Revised Penal Code, is applicable only to cases of robbery committed by a band therein defined, which fall within the scope of and are punishable under Article 295 in relation to subdivisions (3), (4), and (5) of Article 294.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, with the above MODIFICATIONS and the increase of the indemnity that must be paid to the heirs of the late Felix Larong to Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> the decision of the trial court is hereby AFFIRMED.
