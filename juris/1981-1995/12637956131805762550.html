<p>SO ORDERED."<br><br>Evidence for the prosecution shows that in the afternoon 
of December 28, 1984, at around 3:00 o'clock p.m., Lily Abogada and Lolita 
Flores were passengers of a motorcycle driven by Jimmy Plaza and bound for 
Barangay (Bgy.) Diwalwal, a mining area, from Bgy. New Visayan, Trento, Agusan 
del Sur.&nbsp; On their way, they were stopped by armed men who ordered them to 
alight from the motorcycle.&nbsp; The passengers were at gunpoint divested of their 
belongings and valuables with a total estimated worth of P2,000.00 and the 
motorcycle was pushed towards an embankment by accused Loreto 
Pilapil.<br><br>With their arms tied behind their backs, the three passengers 
were led down the cliff towards a forested area.&nbsp; Lily Abogada was sexually 
abused, at the point of a gun, first by the leader of the group and then 
followed by four others.&nbsp; Lily Abogada recognized appellant, Loreto Pilapil, as 
one of those who assaulted her because the latter's mask had accidentally been 
removed from his face.&nbsp; Lily Abogada knew her lady co-passenger Lolita Flores 
was also being abused because the rape of the latter was taking place in a bushy 
place about three meters away.&nbsp; Thereafter, the five armed men fled leaving the 
hapless victims crying.<br><br>Lily Abogada, still with hands tied, crawled 
towards Lolita Flores and asked her to bite off the knot.&nbsp; Jimmy Plaza, who was 
able to untie himself, retrieved his motorcycle.&nbsp; He gave his jacket and shirt 
to the two lady - passengers who had no blouses on.<br><br>They proceeded to the 
Airborne detachment at Trento where Lily Abogada collapsed.&nbsp; Jimmy Plaza went to 
Pulang-lupa to report the incident to the Philippine Constabulary (PC) 
soldiers.&nbsp; The PC soldiers set up a check point for the buses that passed by.&nbsp; 
Jimmy Plaza recognized accused Loreto Pilapil aboard a "Bachelor Bus" and seated 
beside a stout person who claimed to be a soldier.&nbsp; To be sure of appellant's 
identity, witness inquired from the conductor if anybody boarded the bus in 
Pulang-lupa.&nbsp; The conductor replied one boarded in Cuevas and another in 
Trento.&nbsp; When the stout man was asked to open his bag, Jimmy Plaza saw a hand 
grenade and a short arm inside the bag.&nbsp; Jimmy became scared, ran to the back of 
the bus and told the soldiers to "handle the man." The soldiers brought him to 
the check point and questioned him. But he was frightened and got rattled.&nbsp; They 
even had to massage his breast.&nbsp; Since he was so scared, he asked that he be 
allowed to go home.<br><br>Accused who was arrested on January 23, 1985, alleges 
on the other hand, that in the afternoon of December 28, 1984, he was in Trento 
but bound for Davao, together with David Boloran to purchase necessary materials 
for their gold panning activities with cash money borrowed from their financier, 
Lourdes Malasarte.&nbsp; When the bus reached Pulang-lupa, a male passenger boarded 
the bus and sat beside the accused.&nbsp; Later, upon reaching a check-point soldiers 
stopped and boarded the bus together with witness for the prosecution, Jimmy 
Plaza.&nbsp; Upon inquiry by the soldiers as to who were the last persons to board 
the bus, the bus conductor pointed to the big person seated beside the accused.&nbsp; 
The conductor also gave the information that accused and his companion boarded 
the bus at Trento.<br><br>After being interrogated, the big person was allowed 
to return to the bus.&nbsp; Accused and companion were only asked by the soldiers to 
show their tickets.&nbsp; The bus arrived at Davao that night.<br><br>In the morning 
of January 23, 1985, appellant was at the Trento terminal to wait for the 
transportation bound for Mt. Diwalwal.&nbsp; He drank coffee inside a store where he 
saw some policemen.&nbsp; He went back to the terminal to get his things but he was 
arrested upon his return by the policemen informing him that he is wanted for 
the crime of robbery with rape.&nbsp; He was allegedly asked by the police as to the 
whereabouts of his alleged partners-in-crime.&nbsp; Despite his firm denials, he was 
incarcerated at the Municipal jail.<br><br>On the same day of the arrest, Lolita 
Flores, together with Jimmy Plaza and Pat. Conde appeared at the detention cell 
but she failed to identify the accused.&nbsp; Later however, upon the prompting of 
the witness by Jimmy Plaza and Pat. Conde, she pointed to the accused as one of 
the robbers.&nbsp; When accused shouted his demands for his release since Lolita 
Flores allegedly confirmed the fact of his innocense by her failure to identify 
him, accused was reportedly boxed by the policeman and Jimmy Plaza.&nbsp; He also 
alleged that his relatives were allowed to visit him, only after a period of 
more than 2 weeks of detention.&nbsp; Pilapil's wife was summoned to Trento by the 
policemen who according to the accused demanded money for his release.<br><br>In 
convicting the accused, the trial court declared thus:<br><br>"In the light of 
the foregoing considerations, the following incidents are established:</p>
<ol><li>A robbery was committed by five (5) armed malefactors on December 28, 1985, 
at New Visayas, Trento, Agusan del Sur;<br><br></li><li>In the course thereof, Mrs. Lily Abogada was raped by the five 
male-factors.<br></li></ol>
<p>The first question is whether accused Loreto Pilapil is one of the five who 
robbed the victims.<br><br>The answer is the positive and direct identification 
of the said accused by Lily Abogada and Jimmy Plaza.<br><br>The second question 
is was Lily Abogada raped and by whom.<br><br>Again, the narration of Lily 
Abogada on the sexual abuse was straightforward and credible. Her identification 
of the accused was positive.&nbsp; Her testimony is confirmed by circumstances 
following the incident.&nbsp; For instance, Jimmy Plaza saw the two women minus their 
upper dresses, so he gave his jacket to Lily Abogada and T-shirt to Lolita 
Flores. Lily Abogada collapsed at the Airborne Headquarters.<br><br>The 
following day, Lily Abogada had an abortion attended by one Dr. Sarsona.&nbsp; This 
was followed by illness preventing her from going to Trento to identify the 
accused, when apprehended in January, 1985.&nbsp; All these, plus the fact that Lily 
Abogada is a married woman and has nothing to gain but the hurt and shame that 
has befallen on her.&nbsp; Besides, no motive has been shown why she would lie about 
her identifying the accused.<br><br>The defense of alibi put up by the accused 
is not convincing.&nbsp; In fact, it admits that in the afternoon of December 28, 
1985, accused was in the vicinity of the scene of the crime. He admitted he was 
in the Bachelor Bus that was stopped and checked by the PC soldiers at 
Langkilaan at 7:00 P.M. same day.&nbsp; He was in Trento, Agusan del Sur, from 3:00 
to 5:00 P.M.&nbsp; The court noted that the crime scene is only 30 minutes travel 
from Trento, or a distance of 15 kilometers, per testimony of Lily 
Abogada.<br><br>The defense further relied so much on the alleged 
non-identification of Lolita Flores at the Trento Municipal Jail.&nbsp; All the 
defense witnesses corroborated the incident when Lolita Flores failed to 
identify accused Loreto Pilapil.&nbsp; The only hitch is that David Baloran and 
Lourdes Malasarte claimed that they witnessed this particular incident on 
January 23, 1985, the day accused Pilapil was apprehended.&nbsp; Yet, it is an 
established fact that Lolita Flores was subpoenaed from Mt. Diwalwal and came 
down to Trento only on the 25th day of January, 1985.<br><br>Even allowing that 
Lolita Flores failed to identify the accused which is probable, this will not in 
any manner diminish the identification of the accused by Lily Abogada, pointing 
to a scar and her looking at the face of the accused whose T-shirt hood was 
removed at the height of his ecstacy.<br><br>The foregoing considerations 
inevitably lead to no other conclusion, that accused was one of the five (5) 
malefactors who robbed Jimmy Plaza and Lily Abogada of their personal 
belongings, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimmy Plaza — one eyeglass worth P900.00, pocket money and wallet with a 
total of P1,000.00;<br><br>Lily Abogada — two (2) denim pants, T-shirts, 
blouses, wrist watch amounting to P1,000.00, and then sexually abused Lily 
Abogada against her will and without her consent with the use of 
firearms.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant now assigns 2 errors:<br></p>
<p align="center">I</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">THE COURT <em>A QUO</em> ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE IDENTITY OF 
THE ACCUSED LORETO PILAPIL WAS POSITIVELY ESTABLISHED BY THE 
PROSECUTION.<br></p>
<p align="center">II</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CONVICTING THE APPELLANT DESPITE THE 
ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE REQUIRED TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE 
DOUBT.<br><br>Appellant's contentions hold no water.&nbsp; The finding of acts made 
by the trial court establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt 
is sufficiently substantiated by evidence on the records.<br><br>Appellant's 
defense consists mainly in denial of the crime charged and alibi.&nbsp; In support of 
his defense, appellant alleges that:&nbsp; (a) It is unnatural for Jimmy Plaza not to 
have him identified and arrested when the former saw appellant for the first 
inside the bus (b) the prosecution suppressed the sworn statement of Jimmy Plaza 
which purportedly stated that the robbers covered his face and body with an 
empty sack, and hence it would have been impossible for him to identify the 
malefactors (c) contrary to the claim of the victim Lily Abogada, his mask was 
not removed and she could not have therefore, recognized him.<br><br>The 
abovementioned defense is belied by the positive identification of the accused 
by witnesses as brought out in their resolute testimonies, to 
wit:<br><br>Witness Lily Abogada</p>

<p align="justify">When asked further, Lily Abogada unhesitatingly mentioned the 
appellant as one of the armed men:</p>

<p align="justify">The witness' identification of the appellant was further 
strengthened when the latter returned to the scene of the crime and she could 
clearly see him because her blindfold was removed by that time (p. 9,<em> 
id</em>.) and she recognized him because of the scar in his arm (p. 2, 
<em>id</em>.).<br><br>Appellant's identification was also established by Jimmy 
Plaza as one of the armed men who robbed and molested his companion.&nbsp; Jimmy 
Plaza testified, thus:</p>

<p align="justify">As to the allegation that the prosecution suppressed the 
evidence that the face of the witness was covered by an empty sack rendering 
appellant's identification by the witness doubtful this fact is of no moment.&nbsp; 
The aforestated evidence or statement is merely collateral and does not affect 
appellant's identification as his positive identification was already 
established by the testimony of the victim herself.&nbsp; Considering further that 
the issues being raised by the appellant is on credibility of witnesses, We have 
consistently held in a number of recent decisions that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"x x x (U)nless there is a showing that the trial court had 
overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and 
substance that would have affected the result of the case, the appellate court 
will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court.&nbsp; For, having had the 
opportunity of observing the demeanor and behavior of the witnesses while 
testifying, the trial court, more than the reviewing tribunal, is in a better 
position to gauge their credibility, and properly appreciate the relative weight 
of the often conflicting evidence for both parties (<em>People v. Mercado</em>, 
131 SCRA 501 [1984]; citing <em>People v. Ablaza</em>, 30 SCRA 173 [1976]).&nbsp; (p. 
13, Brief or p. 62, <em>Rollo</em>)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Lastly, appellant's defense of alibi was discredited by the 
trial court by finding that appellant was admittedly in the vicinity of the 
scene of the crime, wherein the distance is only 15 kilometers away from Trento 
or only a matter of 30-minutes travel time.&nbsp; For the accused to be credited with 
the defense of alibi, it has been ruled that:<br><br>"The defense of alibi, 
however, in order to be given full faith and credit, must be clearly established 
and must not leave any room for doubt as to its plausibility and veracity.&nbsp; He 
(appellant herein) must not only prove that he was somewhere when the offense 
was committed, but also that it was physically impossible for him to have been 
at the scene of the offense at the time.&nbsp; x x x." (<em>People v. Jacinto</em>, 
133 SCRA 498 [1984]).&nbsp; (p. 14, Brief; p. 63, 
<em>Rollo</em>)<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, finding the appealed decision 
in accordance with law and the evidence, We hereby AFFIRM the same with costs 
against appellant, but the indemnity for the rape is hereby increased to 
P20,000.00.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>. </p>
