<p class="BODY">Sometime in September, 1985, JIBSEN Trading Corp. (JIBSEN, for
short) was contracted by Philippine Bakers, Inc. (PHILBAKE, for short) to
supply the latter with 25,000 metric tons (MT) of 5% MOL wheat flour.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On November 29, 1985, Alfred C. <span class="SpellE">Toeffer</span> International, the supplier of the wheat flour in
Germany (also the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>), loaded on board the
vessel, M/V "FYLYPPA", 14,200 metric tons of wheat flour consigned to
PHILBAKE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime thereafter, JIBFAIR
Shipping Corp. (JIBFAIR, for short) the <span class="SpellE">charterer’s</span>
agent in the Philippines received shipping documents from Kant GmbH,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">charterer’s</span> agent
at the loading port referring to SEXTANT Maritime S.A. (SEXTANT, for short) as
the registered owner of the vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, it appears from the charter party attached as Annex
"A" to the petition, that the vessel owner and time <span class="SpellE">Charterer</span> is CHRISTENSEN Lines (CHRISTENSEN, for
short).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>THEILSHIP is the vessel's
manager (p. 5, Complaint; p. 28, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="12" day="27" year="1985"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">December 27, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, JIBFAIR telexed CHRISTENSEN asking for
inward remittance of US $27,000.00 as port expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>CHRISTENSEN replied that it cannot send the
amount because it was then already under receivership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>JIBSEN was forced to advance US $24,672.00 to
pay for one-third (1/3) of the cost of the bunker fuel used by the vessel and
the fees charged by the Suez Canal authorities through which the vessel passed
on its way to the Philippines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>JIBFAIR
was also forced to advance P49<span class="GramE">,599.70</span> for port
expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vessel arrived at its

<p class="BODY">On January 14, 1986,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">JIBSEN, </span>a corporation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">existing under the laws of the Republic of
Nauru, and JIBFAIR, a Philippine Corporation, filed a case for sum of money with
prayer for restraining order, mandatory injunction and attachment against P.V.
CHRISTENSEN and/or <span class="SpellE">Theilship</span> and/or SEXTANT Maritime
S.A. (SEXTANT, for short), all foreign entities, with the Regional Trial Court
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City and docketed as Civil Case No.
17917.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was raffled to Branch
XVI presided over by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Agton</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1986">January 15, 1986</st1:date>,
respondent judge issued an order:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1)

3) directing the sheriff of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>

order directing the unloading of the cargo and the order enjoining the
defendants from removing the vessel out of Philippine territory were returned
unimplemented for the reason that an order of arrest against the vessel was
previously issued by the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Region, Branch
146, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, in connection with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">another case filed thereat involving the same
defendants in Civil Case No. 17917.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

PHILBAKE filed a motion for leave to file complaint-in-intervention against the

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1986, herein petitioners Nordic Asia Limited (now
known as <span class="SpellE">DnC</span> Limited) and Bankers Trust Company, both
foreign corporations, filed an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">urgent
motion for leave to intervene and attached thereto a complaint-in-intervention
(pp. 83-91, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), alleging that they have
legal interests in the vessel MV "FYLYPPA", being the unpaid
mortgagees thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both JIBSEN and
JIBFAIR opposed the motion claiming that <span class="SpellE">DnC</span> and

<p class="BODY">On April 1, 1986, respondent Judge granted <span class="SpellE">DnC</span>
Limited and Bankers Trust Co.'s motion for intervention but denied their motion
to approve <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> and to discharge order of
attachment for two (2) reasons:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) <span class="SpellE">DnC</span> and Bankers Trust Co. are not the owners of the vessel
nor <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are </span>they appearing on behalf
of its owners; and 2) for a writ of attachment to be discharged on a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>, the applicant must post a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
equal to the value of the property attached.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 8, 1986, petitioners filed a manifestation/urgent motion

JIBFAIR and <span class="SpellE">JIBSEN's</span> other claims before the sheriff
of Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, petitioners
argued that while they may not be the owners of the vessel, they have a direct,
actual, subsisting and substantial interest in the property attached, being the
unpaid mortgagees of the vessel (pp. 158-161, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>At
