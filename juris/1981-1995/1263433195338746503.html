September 2, 1955.  Daniel Jovellanos
and Philippine American Life Insurance Company (Philamlife) entered into a
contract denominated as a lease and conditional sale agreement over Lot 8,
Block 3 of the latter's Quezon City Community Development Project, including a
bungalow thereon, located at and known as No. 55 South Maya Drive, Philamlife
Homes, Quezon City.  At that time,
Daniel Jovellanos was married to Leonor Dizon, with whom he had three children,
the petitioners herein.  Leonor Dizon
died on January 2, 1959.  On May 30,
1967, Daniel married private respondent Annette H. Jovellanos with whom he
begot two children, her herein corespondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 18, 1971, petitioner Mercy Jovellanos married Gil
Martinez and, at the behest of Daniel Jovellanos, they built a house on the back
portion of the premises.  On January 8,
1975, with the lease amounts having been paid, Philamlife executed to Daniel
Jovellanos a deed of absolute sale and, on the next day, the latter donated to
herein petitioners all his rights, title and interests over the lot and
bungalow thereon.  On September 8, 1985,
Daniel Jovellanos died and his death spawned the present controversy, resulting
in the filing by private respondents of Civil Case No. Q-52058 in the court
below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Annette H. Jovellanos claimed in the lower
court that the aforestated property was acquired by her deceased husband while
their marriage was still subsisting, by virtue of the deed of absolute sale
dated January 8, 1975 executed by Philamlife in favor of her husband, Daniel Jovellanos,
who was issued Transfer Certificate of Title No. 212286 of the Register of
Deeds of Quezon City and which forms part of the conjugal partnership of the
second marriage.  Petitioners, on the
other hand, contend that the property, specifically the lot and the bungalow
erected thereon, as well as the beneficial and equitable title thereto, were
acquired by their parents during the existence of the first marriage under
their lease and conditional sale agreement with Philamlife of September 2, 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 28,1989, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered
judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
with the following dispositions:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. Ordering the
liquidation of the partner­ship of the second marriage and directing the reimbursement
of the amount advanced by the partnership of the first marriage as well (as) by
the late Daniel Jovellanos and the defendants spouses Gil and Mercia<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> J. Martinez in the acquisition of the lot and
bungalow described in the Lease and Conditional Sale Agreement (Exhs. D and 1);</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. After such
liquidation and reimbursement, declaring the plaintiff Annette Jovellanos as <u>pro-indiviso</u>
<u>owner</u> of 1/2 of the property described in TCT No. 212268 (sic) and the

shall make the partition in accordance with Sec. 5, Rule 69 of the Revised
Rules of Court;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals, in its challeged decision, held that
the lease and conditional sale agreement executed by and between Daniel
Jovellanos and Philamlife is a lease contract and, in support of its
conclusion, reproduced as its own the following findings of the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"It is therefore incumbent upon the vendee to comply with all
his obligations, i.e., the payment of the stipulated rentals and adherence to
the limitations set forth in the contract before the legal title over the
property is conveyed to the lessee-vendee.  This, in effect, is a <u>pactum</u> <u>reservati</u> <u>dominii</u>
which is common in sales on installment plan of real estate whereby ownership
is retained by the vendor and payment of the agreed price being a condition
precedent before full ownership could be transferred (Wells vs. Samonte,
38768-R, March 23, 1973; Perez vs. Erlanger and Galinger Inc., CA 54 OG
6088).  The dominion or full ownership
of the subject property was only transferred to Daniel Jovellanos upon full
payment of the stipulated price giving rise to the execution of the Deed of
Absolute Sale on January 8, 1975 (Exh. 2) when the marriage between the
plaintiff and Daniel Jovellanos was already in existence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention of the defendants that the <u>jus</u> <u>in</u>
<u>re</u> <u>aliena</u> or right in the property of another person (Gabuya vs.
Cruz, 38 SCRA 98) or beneficial use and enjoyment of the property or the
equitable title has long been vested in the vendee-lessee Daniel Jovellanos
upon execution of Exh. '1' is true.  But
the instant case should be differentiated from the cited cases of Pugeda v.
Trias, et al., 4 SCRA 849; and Alvarez vs. <span style="">Espiritu, G.R. </span>L-18833, August 14, 1965, which cannot be applied
herein even by analogy.  In Pugeda, the
subject property refers solely to friar lands and is governed by Act 1120
wherein the certificate of sale is considered a conveyance of ownership subject
only to the resolutory condition that the sale may be rescinded if the agreed
price has not been paid in full; in the case at bar, however, payment of the stipulated
price is a condition precedent before ownership could be transferred to the
vendee." <a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the modification that private respondents should also
reimburse to petitioners their proportionate shares in the proven
hospitalization and burial expenses of the late Daniel Jovellanos, respondent
Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, applying Article 118
of the Family Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art.118.  Property
bought on installment paid partly from exclusive funds of either or both
spouses and partly from conjugal funds belongs to the buyer or buyers <span style="">if </span>full ownership was vested before
the marriage and to the conjugal partnership if such ownership was vested
during the marriage.  In either case,
any amount advanced by the partnership or by either or both spouses shall be
reimbursed by the owner or owners upon liquidation of the partnership."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now seek this review, invoking their assignment of
errors raised before the respondent court and which maybe capsulized into two
contentions, namely, that (1) the lower court erred in holding that the lot and
bunga­low covered by the lease and conditional sale agreement (Exhibit 1) is
conjugal property of the second marriage of the late Daniel Jovellanos; and (2)
the lower court erred in holding that the provisions of the Family Code are
applicable in resolving the rights of the parties herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>petitioners’
position that the Family Code should not be applied in determining the
successional rights of the party litigants to the estate of Daniel Jovellanos,
for to do so would be to impair their vested property rights over the property
in litigation which they have acquired long before the Family Code took effect.
<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To arrive at the applicable law, it would accordingly be best to
look into the nature of the contract entered into by the contracting
parties.  As appositely observed by
respondent court, the so-called lease agreement is, therefore, very much in
issue.  Preliminarily, we do not lose
sight of the basic rule that a contract which is not contrary to law, morals,
good customs, public order or public policy has the force of law between the
contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Its provisions are binding not only upon them but also upon their heirs and
assigns.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contract entered into by the late Daniel Jovellanos and
Philamlife is specifically denominated as a "Lease and Conditional Sale
Agreement" over the property involved with a lease period of twenty years
at a monthly rental of P288.87, by virtue of which the former, as
lessee-vendee, had only the right of possession over the property.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In a lease agreement, the lessor transfers merely the temporary use and
enjoyment of the thing leased.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> In
fact, Daniel Jovellanos bound himself there­in, among other things, to use the
property solely as a residence, take care thereof like a good father of a
family, permit inspection thereof by representatives of Philamlife, and abide
by all rules and regulations of Philamlife in regard to the use and
preservation of the property.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is specifically provided, however, that "(i)f, at the
expiration of the lease period herein agreed upon, the LESSEE-VENDEE shall have
fully and faithfully complied with all his obligations herein stipulated, the
LESSOR-VENDOR shall immediately sell, transfer and convey to the LESSEE-VENDEE
the property which is the subject matter of this agreement; x x x."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The conditional sale agreement in said contract is, therefore, also
in the nature of a contract to sell, as contradistinguished from a contract of
sale.  In a contract to sell or a
conditional sale, ownership is not transferred upon delivery of the property
but upon full payment of the purchase price.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Generally, ownership is transferred upon delivery, but even if delivered, the
ownership may still be with the seller until full payment of the price is made,
if there is a stipulation to this effect.  The stipulation is usually known as a <u><span style="">pactum</span></u><span style=""> <u>reservati</u>
<u>dominii</u>, </span>or contractual reservation of title, and is common in
sales on the installment plan.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Compliance with the stipulated payments is a suspensive condition,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the failure of which prevents the obligation of the vendor to convey title from
acquiring binding force. <a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hornbook lore from civilists clearly lays down the distinctions
between a contract of sale in which the title passes to the buyer upon delivery
of the thing sold, and a contract to sell where, by agreement, the ownership is
reserved in the seller and is not to pass until full payment of the purchase
price.  In the former, non-payment of
the price is a negative resolutory condition: in the latter, full payment is a
positive suspensive condition.  In the
former, the vendor loses and cannot recover the ownership of the thing sold
until and unless the contract of sale is rescinded or set aside; in the latter,
the title remains in the vendor if the vendee does not comply with the
condition precedent of making full payment as specified in the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, viewed either as a lease contract or a contract to
sell, or as a contractual amalgam with facets of both, what was vested by the
aforestated contract in petitioners’ predecessor in interest was merely the
beneficial title to the property in question.  His monthly payments were made in the concept of rentals, but with the
agreement that if he faithfully complied with all the stipulations in the
contract the same would in effect be considered as amortization payments to be
applied to the predetermined price of the said property.  He consequently acquired ownership thereof
only upon full payment of the said amount hence, although he had been in
possession of the premises since September 2, 1955, it was only on January 8,
1975 that Philamlife executed the deed of absolute sale thereof in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conditions of the aforesaid agreement also bear notice,
considering the stipulations therein that Daniel Jovellanos, as lessee-vendee,
shall not -</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"(b)  </span>Sublease said property to a third
party;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  (c)   Engage in business or
practice any profession within the property;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span style="">x </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>  (f)     Make any alteration or improvement on the
property without the prior written consent of the LESSOR-VENDOR;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(g)   Cut down, damage, or remove any tree or
shrub, or remove or quarry any stone, rock or earth within the property,
without the prior written consent of the LESSOR-VENDOR;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(h)   Assign to another his right, title and
interest under and by virtue of this Agreement, without the prior written
consent and approval of the LESSOR-VENDOR."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The above restrictions further bolster
the conclusion that Daniel Jovellanos did not enjoy the full attributes of
ownership until the execution of the deed of sale in his favor.  The law recognizes in the owner the right to
enjoy and dispose of a thing, without other limitations than those established
by law,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
and, under the contract, Daniel Jovellanos evidently did not possess or enjoy
such rights of ownership.<span style="font-size: 5pt;" arial="" narrow";"=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find no legal impediment to the application in this case of
the rule of retroactivity provided in the Family Code to the effect that ?</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 256.  This Code
shall have retroactive effect insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested
or acquired rights in accordance with the Civil Code or other laws."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The right of Daniel Jovellanos to the property under the contract
with Philamlife was merely an inchoate and expectant right which would ripen
into a vested right only upon his acquisition of ownership which, as
aforestated, was contingent upon his full payment of the rentals and compliance
with all his contractual obligations thereunder.  A vested right is an immediate fixed right of present and future
enjoyment.  It is to be distinguished
from a right that is expectant or contingent.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> It
is a right which is fixed, unalterable, absolute, complete and unconditional to
the exercise of which no obstacle exists,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> and
which is perfect in itself and not dependent upon a contingency.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, for a property right to be vested, there must be a transition from the
potential or contingent to the actual, and the proprietary interest must have
attached to a thing; it must have become fixed or established and is no longer
open to doubt or controversy.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, which was upheld by respondent court, correctly
ruled that the cases cited by petitioners are inapplicable to the case at bar
since said cases involved friar lands which are governed by a special law, Act
1120, which was specifically enacted for the purpose.  In the sale of friar lands, upon execution of the contract to
sell, a certificate of sale is delivered to the vendee and such act is
considered as a conveyance of ownership, subject only to the resolutory
condition that the sale may be rescinded if the agreed price shall not be paid
in full.  In the instant case, no
certificate of sale was delivered and full payment of the rentals was a
condition precedent before ownership <span style="">could
</span>be transferred to the vendee. <a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have earlier underscored that the deed of absolute sale was
executed in 1975 by Philamlife, pursuant to the basic contract between the parties,
only after full payment of the rentals.  Upon the execution of said deed of absolute sale, full ownership was
vested in Daniel Jovellanos.  Since, as
early as 1967,he was already married to Annette H. Jovellanos, this property
necessarily belonged to his conjugal partnership with his said second wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court, the parties stipulated during the
pre-trial conference in the case below that the rentals/installments under the
lease and conditional sale agreement were paid as follows:  (a) from September 2, 1955 to January 2,
1959, by conjugal funds of the first marriage; (b) from January 3, 1959 to May
29, 1967, by capital of Daniel Jovellanos; (c) from May 30, 1967 to 1971, by
conjugal funds of the second marriage; and (d) from 1972 to January 8, 1975, by
conjugal funds of the spouses Gil and Mercy Jovellanos-Martinez.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Both courts, therefore, ordered that reimbursements should be made in line with
the pertinent provision of Article 118 of the Family Code that "any amount
advanced by the partnership or by either or both spouses shall be reimbursed by
the owner or owners upon liquidation of the partnership."</p>
