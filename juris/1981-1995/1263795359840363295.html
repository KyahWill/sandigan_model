as defined and penalized under Article 335(3) of the Revised Penal Code, and
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
with the accessories of the law, to indemnify the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baclig</span>, in the amount of

<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The victim, <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baclig</span>, testified that one day in July, 1975, after
lunchtime, she went to the house of the accused who is her granduncle (the
latter is the husband of the sister of the victim's grandmother) and whom she
fondly calls "<span class="SpellE">Lelong</span> Anton", to get her
pillow and blanket which she intended to use the night before; that after
getting hold of the said articles in one of the rooms at the second floor of
the house of the accused, the latter pulled her to another room on the
northeastern part of the house, after which he closed the door and one of the
windows which was then open; that the accused made her sit down on the bed with
her feet touching the floor after which he lifted her buttocks a little and
removed her panties while the accused was kneeling; that after having removed
her panties, the accused removed his own pants and underwear while standing on
the floor, after which he pushed her and made her lie down on the middle of the
bed by raising her legs which were then hanging; after having pushed her
towards the middle of the bed, he let her spread her legs, went on top of her
and inserted his penis into her vagina by performing the "up and down
motion" for about ten (10) minutes; that after having satisfied his lust,
the accused got down and while smiling at the girl, warned her not to report
the matter to anyone, otherwise, he would kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused was in possession of a kitchen
knife at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite what
happened, the girl picked up the pillow and the blanket, went home and reported
to school late in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
she went to urinate, she noticed blood stains on her skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the following morning when she took <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>bath, blood stains were still in her
garments.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Miss Mariana <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> Benito and Mrs. Francisca
<span class="SpellE">Suero</span>, both teaching at the <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>
North Elementary School, took the witness stand one after the other and
testified about their lingering doubts and suspicions regarding the abnormal
enlargement of the breast of <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> which they began
to notice in July, 1975 and which prompted them to summon her parents in
November, 1975 after the girl had revealed the violation of her honor by her
"<span class="SpellE">Lelong</span> Anton" sometime in July, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was upon the <span class="SpellE">proddings</span>
of said witnesses that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>medical
and physical examination was conducted on the person of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Loida</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baclig</span>, by Dr. Soledad

<p class="BODY">In support of his second assignment of error, accused contends that
the finding of the trial court that the presence of an old laceration at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> shows that the victim was

conclusive confirmation in the testimony of the medico-legal officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused further claims that even the
