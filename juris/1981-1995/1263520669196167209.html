<p class="BODY">From the record, the facts relative to this case may be stated as
follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is a corporation
operating a jai-alai fronton for sport and amusement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has its own maintenance group for the
upkeep of its premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">renovation of its main building, which work
is not included in maintenance, it hired private respondents, <span class="SpellE">Cadatal</span>, Jr., a plumber, and <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span>,
a mason, together with 30 other workers on February 2, 1976 for a period of one
month, to continue even after that period should their services be needed
further in the renovation work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
renovation was completed by the end of October 1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, management decided to construct an
Annex to the Building, and private respondents were assigned to work on a fire

stating that the nature of the jobs performed by private respondents was

temporary restraining order was issued by this Court on <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1980</st1:date>, enjoining the respondents from

 12, 1980</st1:date>, we gave due course to the Petition and required the
submittal of simultaneous memoranda, which has been complied with by petitioner
but not by private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pivotal to the resolution of this controversy is the issue of
whether or not private respondents are regular employees entitled to security
of tenure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that they are,
while petitioner contends that they are merely casual emergency workers
employed for a particular job.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provision of the Labor Code, as amended, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 281.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Regular and
Casual Employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The provisions of
written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral
agreements of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where
the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary
or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the
employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking, the completion
or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of
the employee or where the work or services to be performed is seasonal in
nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by
the preceding paragraph:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That,
any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such
service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with
respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall
continue while such actually exists."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents were hired for a specific project - to
renovate the main building, where major repairs such as painting the main
building, repair of the roof, cleaning of clogged water pipes and drains, and
other necessary repairs were required.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It was made <span class="GramE">known,</span> and so understood at the start of
the hiring, that their services would last until the completion of the
renovation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
They rendered service <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from February 2
to </span><st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 13.0pt">December 11, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">, almost 11 months, but less than a year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its Report to the Department of Labor,
petitioner gave the reason for termination as "due to termination of
project".</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> It was only private respondents <span class="SpellE">Cadatal</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span>, out of
the 32 hired for the renovation, who questioned their termination, the 30 other
workers having acquiesced to their termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents merely alleged in their letter-complaint that "<span class="SpellE">kami'y</span> <span class="SpellE">inalis</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
<span class="SpellE">trabaho</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">walang</span> <span class="SpellE">dahilan</span>".</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> There could be no other reason, however,
than that the termination of private respondents was because their <span class="GramE">services</span> were no longer needed and they had nothing more to
do since the project for which they were hired had been completed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact was not that private respondents
were hired as maintenance helpers, because <span class="GramE">petitioner
corporation</span> had a regular maintenance force.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Private respondents, as well as the other 30
workers, were needed as additional hands for the renovation work and not for
ordinary upkeep and maintenance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
erection of the fire escape and other small jobs after the renovation cannot be
deemed maintenance but more of casual work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The casual or limited
character of private respondents' employment, therefore, is evident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were engaged for a specific project or
undertaking and fall within the exception provided for in Article 281 of the
Labor Code, </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Not being regular employees, it cannot be
justifiably said that petitioner had dismissed them without just cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are not entitled to reinstatement with
full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lastly, although no
longer necessary to the resolution of the petition, it is claimed by petitioner
that it was denied due process of law, since the case below could not be the
subject of a summary judgment as questions of fact and law are involved, and
that even before the petitioner could file its Answer, a summary judgment was
rendered by respondent <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The comment of the
Solicitor General on this point is hereunder </span>quoted.</p>

<blockquote>"Besides even granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that there was no hearing before respondent <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>,
it cannot be denied that petitioner had the opportunity to present its own case
and submit evidence in support thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the decision of respondent <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>,
petitioner filed a 10-page appeal to the Secretary of Labor, attaching thereto
as Annex 'B' its Reply/Opposition to the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong's</span>
decision, petitioner filed a 7-page appeal with the Office of the
President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on two occasions,
petitioner was allowed to present and intelligibly argue the merits of its
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Maglasang</u></span>
<u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Ople</u></span> (63 SCRA 508):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It is thus apparent that even granting the absence of any hearing
at the stage of mediation and fact-finding, petitioner was afforded the
occasion to explain matters fully and present its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">side </span>of the controversy twice, the first time in his appeal with
respondent Commission and thereafter in the review conducted by respondent
Secretary of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would follow that
the objections premised on lack of respect for the due process guarantee lack
support in the record (citing <span class="SpellE">Demaronsing</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tandayag</span>, 58 SCRA 484; De <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
vs. Flores, 62 Phil. 106; <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span>, 22 SCRA

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">But here, the judgment
below is being reversed because public respondents had overlooked certain facts
of significance, notably, private respondents' employment for a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">specific project </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and other small jobs like the erection of the
fire escape which cannot be deemed as maintenance, the existence of a regular
maintenance force in petitioner corporation, their services for less than one
year, and the circumstance that their thirty other co-workers accepted their
termination without question, all of which are sufficient to alter the
questioned Order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
