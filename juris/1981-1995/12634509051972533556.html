in­junction, to annul and set aside the order denying the petitioner's motion
to dismiss the complaint in Civil Case No. 2315 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, entitled: "Angel A. Reyes, Inc.,
plaintiff, <i>versus</i> Miss <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Santos,
defendant," as well as the order declaring her in default, and all
proceedings made subse­quent thereto; and to restrain the respondent Judge of
First Instance from further conducting the trial of the said case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The record shows that on
January 17, 1976, the herein pri­vate respondent, Angel A. Reyes, Inc., a
domestic corporation with principal offices at 1363 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Boulevard Extension, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, filed a complaint
for "Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span>" against the herein
peti­tioner, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Santos, with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, docketed therein as Civil Case
No. 2315.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Summons and a copy of the complaint were served upon <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>
Santos on <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1976</st1:date>,
but she failed to file the required answer within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of the plaintiff
therein, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Santos was declared in default on <st1:date year="1977" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1977</st1:date> and the plaintiff
was directed to present its evidence on <st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1977</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the order declaring her in default, the peti­tioner,
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Santos, filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint on the ground that the Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction
over the action for "unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>"
which is within the compe­tence of the municipal court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The plaintiff therein opposed the motion, claiming that the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
had no personality to ask for the dismissal of the complaint because she lost
her status in court when she was declared in default, and that, assuming that
the herein petitioner had not lost her standing in court, her motion to dismiss
the complaint for lack of jurisdiction would not prosper as the complaint,
although entitled one for "Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span>",
is for the cancellation and annulment of the contract of sale of real property
which is within the jurisdiction of the court of first instance.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
After the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the issues, the respondent
Judge issued an order on <st1:date year="1977" day="26" month="4">April 26,
 1977</st1:date>, denying the motion to dismiss for lack of merit since the
case was principally an annulment or cancellation of a contract of sale of real
property.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1977, the herein petitioner filed a motion to lift the
order of default, alleging that she failed to file an answer by reason of
fraud, mistake and/or excusable negligence in that after receiving the summons
and a copy of the complaint, she went to see Angel A. Reyes at his office in
1363 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard Extension, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, to confer with him regarding the case; that Angel A. Reyes, during their
meeting, assured her that if she would update her accounts on the lots, he
would not pursue the case anymore; that with that understanding, she continued
to make payments on the lots, which the plaintiff received; and that the
assurance of Angel A. Reyes made her believe that it was no longer necessary
for her to answer the complaint and realized her error quite too late when she
received a copy of the order declaring her in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further claimed that she has a good and
meritorious defense in that she had been faithfully and religiously paying her
monthly installments for the lots in question for more than 12 years and she
already paid the sum of P96,000.00 to the plaintiff although the contract price
is only P57,500.00, and she is still paying for the said lots; that the acts of
the plaintiff in <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> unilaterally the
contracts of purchase and sale, the forfeiture of the install­ment payments
made, and the filing of the instant complaint are repugnant to public policy
and do violence to existing laws; and that to allow all the parties herein to
fully ventilate their respective sides of the question and to present their
evidence will best serve the interests of substantial justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The plaintiff therein opposed the motion for the reason that the herein peti­tioner's
failure to file an answer within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period is not excusable and the petitioner herein had really intended not to
file an answer to the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondent Judge denied the Motion on May 24, 1977, stating that the
negligence of the peti­tioner in failing to file an answer is not excusable
since the motion to lift the order of default was filed after the lapse of four
(4) months from the time she received a copy of the order declaring her in
default; and that the herein petitioner wantonly disregarded established
procedure.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant recourse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As prayed for, a temporary restraining order was issued, restraining the
respondent Judge from further proceeding with the trial of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record of the case, We are convinced that
the respondent Judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the petitioner's
motion to dismiss the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record shows that the petitioner filed the said motion to dismiss immediately
after her receipt of the order declaring her in default without first filing a
motion to set aside the order of default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the rule that a party declared in default loses his standing in
court and is not entitled to any notice of subsequent proceeding nor to take
part in the trial until he files a motion to set aside the default order.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner, therefore, had no right to file the said motion to dis­miss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the issue of whether or not the
action is purely a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> action and as such
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Angeles City Court, and, therefore,
beyond the jurisdiction of the respondent Judge of first instance, not having
been properly raised in the lower court, is academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, We find that the respondent Judge erred in denying the
petitioner's motion to lift the order of default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that upon receipt of the
summons and copy of the complaint, the petitioner immediately went to see Mr.
Angel A. Reyes, president and executive officer of the respondent corporation
bearing his name, about the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr.
Reyes assured her that if she would update her accounts, he would not pursue
the case anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accord­ingly, the
petitioner paid her accrued obligations to the plaintiff and did not file any
answer to the complaint anymore, and was surprised when she received a copy of
the order declaring her in de­fault.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately thereafter, she took steps to vacate the order of
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the
failure of the herein petitioner to answer the complaint within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period is excusable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the petitioner appears to have a good and meritorious
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She averred that the records of
the respondent corpora­tion are not in order and that she had been religiously
and faith­fully paying her account with the respondent corporation for twelve
(12) years already and had paid to the corporation the amount of P96,000.00
although the total contract price for the two lots in question is only
P57,500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If proven, such
circumstances may defeat the plaintiff's claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the motion to lift the order of default was filed four (4)
months after the petitioner was declared in default, no judg­ment has been
rendered in the case as yet so that the filing of the said motion was within
the period prescribed by the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 3, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court, a party declared in de­fault
may <i style="">at any time after discovery thereof
and before judgment</i> file a motion under oath to set aside the order of
default upon proper showing that his failure answer was due to fraud, accident,
mistake or excusable neglect and that he has a meritorious defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the failure of the petitioner to file her answer
to the complaint within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period is
excusable; and that the granting of the petitioner's motion to set aside the
order of default would in no way prejudice the respondent corpora­tion and
deprive it of any substantial right, nor is there evi­dence of intent to unduly
delay the case, the respondent Judge should have applied the Rules liberally
and set aside her order of de­fault.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Courts should be liberal in setting aside orders of default for a
default judgment is frowned upon, and unless it clearly appears that the
re-opening of the case is intended for delay, it is best that trial courts give
both parties every chance to fight their case fairly and in the open, without
resort to technicality.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>
