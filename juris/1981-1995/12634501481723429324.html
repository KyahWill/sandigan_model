				<H3>AMELITO R. MUTUC, PETITIONER, VS.
JUDGE JAIME R. AGLORO, (COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, BRANCH
XXIII) AND ASSOCCIATED CITIZENS BANK, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The pleadings disclose the following allegations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> was one of the organizers in 1964 of the Associated
Banking Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For his efforts, he
was given one thousand shares of stock with a total par value of one hundred
thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He became chairman of
the board and legal consultant of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1965, <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> resigned as board
chairman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was allegedly agreed upon
that because he did not receive any remuneration as board chairman, he would be
paid twenty thousand pesos after his resignation (p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> surrendered to the bank his stock
certificate for the 1,000 shares on the alleged understanding that the sum of
P120<span class="GramE">,000</span> would be given to him in the form of an
overdraft line.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the overdraft agreement dated <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1965</st1:date>, the bank allowed <span class="SpellE">Mutuc's</span>
<span class="SpellE">overdrawings</span> in his current account up to eighty
thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that agreement, it
was stipu­lated that "the books of the bank shall be final and conclusive
evidence concerning the amount due to the bank" (p. 16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The overdraft line was increased to one hundred twenty thousand
pesos in a supplementary agreement dated <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the bank, <span class="SpellE">Mutuc's</span> <span class="SpellE">overdrawings</span> from his current account as of <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="2">February 29, 1972</st1:date> amounted to P189<span class="GramE">,395.26</span>, with twelve percent interest <u>per</u> <u>annum</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1979</st1:date>,
the bank sued <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> in the Court of First Instance of
Manila for the recovery of the said sum of P189<span class="GramE">,395.26</span>
plus interest and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> averred in his answer that
because the bank (it merged with the Citizens Bank in 1975 and is now known as
the Associated Citizens Bank) committed itself to pay him P120<span class="GramE">,000</span>, through an overdraft line, the bank did not sue him
for a period of more than ten years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in its order of <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1980</st1:date> denied <span class="SpellE">Mutuc's</span>
motion for a bill of particulars as to when the ceiling of P120<span class="GramE">,000</span> in his overdraft line was reached or how the sum of
P189,395.26 was arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reasoned
out that the parti­culars sought by <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> were
"merely evidentiary".</p>

<p class="BODY">After submitting his answer, <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>
filed a motion praying that he be allowed to inspect and copy the records of
the bank regarding the withdrawals and payments made by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1980</st1:date> denied the Motion
on the ground that it involves evidentiary matters.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>,
which <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1981</st1:date>, he contends that respondent judge
committed a grave abuse of discretion in denying his motions for a bill of
particulars and for inspection and copying of the bank's records.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank argues that <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> should be
knowledgeable with his own account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
did not ask for particulars when in 1977 the bank in a letter of demand
apprised him that his overdraft balance amounted to P189,395.26 (p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> in his reply to that
demand letter requested that he be given up to the end of the year to settle
his account (p. 41 <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">However, <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> in his answer said that
because he has no record of his <span class="SpellE">overdrawings</span> he could
not admit that he is indebted to the bank in the amount already stated</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that this is a case where technicalities in pleading
should be avoided in order to attain substantial justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fairness to <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>,
respondent bank should give him a detailed and complete or consolidated
statement of his withdrawals and payments from the time his overdraft line
commenced or as to how the said sum of P189<span class="GramE">,395.26</span> was
computed or arrived at.</p>

<p class="BODY">That procedure is in consonance with the rules on discovery and
the avowed policy of the Rules of Court (which allow even the so-called
"fishing expedition" banned under Act No 190) to require the parties
to lay their cards on the table to facilitate a settlement of the case before
the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted by Chief Justice Moran, the Rules of Court provide
"a more effective system of bill of discovery which does away with that
old and obnoxious practice of secrecy and surprises in the preparation and
trial of cases".</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to the bank's advantage to disclose the particulars sought
by <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> so that even before the pre-trial and trial
the lower court can see whether its claim is just and meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That disclosure may pave the way for a
summary judgment, if warranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, if, as <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> said,
he has no record of his withdrawals or he cannot locate the monthly statements
sent to him by the bank, then he should be given access to its records
regarding his indebtedness so that his accountant can check the bank's
computation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, bank
employees commit honest mistakes in computing a borrower's liability.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's order of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1980</st1:date> is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent bank is directed within ten days
from the date the parties are notified of the entry of judgment in this case to
give petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> a complete statement as to how
his alleged debt of P189<span class="GramE">,395.26</span> was computed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Should the petitioner be dissatisfied with that statement, then,
pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Court, the bank should allow him to inspect
and copy its records supporting the items in that statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> De Castro, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
