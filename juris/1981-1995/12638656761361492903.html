				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioners' appeal from the adverse decision of the
Intermediate Appellate Court promulgated on July 11, 1984 in AC-G.R. CV No.
00134<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
was, by this Court's Resolution dated January 30, 1985, given "limited due
course ** insofar as the award of damages is concerned." The Appellate
Tribunal's <span class="GramE">decision</span> affirmed, with a slight
modification, the judgment of <span style="">the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> in Civil Case No. 193,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""> the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, and in view of all the foregoing, the Court
believes, and so holds, that the Extrajudicial Partition with Power to Sell,
Exhibits E and E-1 (Exhibits 5 and 50A) acknowledged before Atty. Bernardo
Cuevas, and the Deed of Sale, Exhibits B and B-1, acknowledged before Atty.
Marcelo Domingo, are valid and effective, and Lot No. 2154-A, now covered by
TCT No. 9234, is owned by the defendants with the exception of the area of
24,385 sq. m. on the western portion thereof which has <span style="">been </span>repurchased by, and <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to
Mrs. Andrea <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Dongco</span> by virtue of the already
final decision in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-56.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint of the plaintiffs is hereby
dismissed, with costs upon the plaintiffs.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the defendants' counterclaim, it had been established that
defendants have suffered mental torture and anxiety and shame and, therefore,
entitled to moral damages; have hired services of counsel because of the filing
of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants are hereby
granted moral damages in the sum of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, to be
paid by the plaintiffs jointly and severally.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To give lesson to the plaintiffs and to the public the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is hereby granted the defendants as exemplary
damages also payable by plaintiffs jointly and severally; the defendants are
also granted for attorney's fees the sum of P2,500.00, also payable by
plaintiffs jointly and severally."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The only change made by the Intermediate
Appellate Court was the reduction of the award of moral damages from P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P5,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other dispositions were maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs in said Civil Case No. 193 were Andrea <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span>

74,385 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Named
as defendants were the spouses <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jatico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anacoreta</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarrientos</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> the plaintiffs asserted that -</p>

<blockquote>1) <span class="GramE">they</span> were the owners of said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
No. 2154-A, by inheritance from <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Dongco</span>, Andrea's husband;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) the western portion of this lot, with an area of five (5)
hectares or so, was mortgaged on February 18, 1958 to <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jatico</span> to secure an indebtedness of P2,250.00 with a
stipulation that the latter would have possession and enjoyment thereof until
redemption could be effected within a period of three years from December 9,
1957;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) <span class="GramE">the</span> mortgage deed was executed by
Andrea <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> <span class="SpellE">Dongco</span> and
her son, Isidro, and daughter, Aurea;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>4) subsequently, in the partition of Lot 2154-A made in 1959, the
eastern portion, measuring 24,385 square meters, was allotted to Andrea <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> <span class="SpellE">Dongco</span>, and the western
portion, measuring as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, 5 hectares, was
adjudicated to her children pro <span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5) in March, 1960, Andrea <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> <span class="SpellE">Dongco</span> obtained a loan from the <span class="SpellE">Jatico</span>
Spouses and gave as collateral the eastern portion of the property awarded to
her in virtue of the partition above mentioned, but the <span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span>,
taking advantage of her illiteracy, duped her into signing a document of sale
conveying the western portion to the former;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6) <span class="GramE">on</span> <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1960</st1:date>, being then in financial distress,
Andrea sold to <span class="SpellE">Jatico</span> the eastern portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2154-A in virtue of which Andrea's title (TCT No. T-7125) was cancelled and a
new one issued in favor of <span class="SpellE">Jatico</span> (TCT No. T-9234);</blockquote>

<blockquote>7) <span class="GramE">in</span> Civil Case No. 56 instituted by
Andrea on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date> a
compromise agreement was reached in which the <span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span>
<span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to her said eastern portion; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>8) <span class="GramE">in</span> 1964, Andrea and her children
offered to redeem the western portion of the land but the <span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span>
unjustifiably refused.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">They prayed for the declaration of nullity of the sale to the <span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span> of the <span class="GramE">western</span> portion of
the land and its restoration to them, and the payment by the <span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span> of actual, moral and exemplary damages, as well as
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span> belied the <span class="SpellE">Dongcos</span>' allegations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their answer,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> they averred that -</p>

<blockquote>1) Lot 2154-A had in truth been legally conveyed to them by all the
<span class="SpellE">Dongcos</span> thru their mother, Andrea, who was their
attorney-in-fact, her authority being evidenced by a special power of attorney
incorporated in the deed of sale; and they had paid the price agreed upon,
P5,000.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) there had indeed been a compromise in Civil Case No. 56 and in
virtue thereof, the <span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span> had agreed to the
repurchase by the plaintiffs and the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to
them of an area of 24,385 square meters to be taken from the western portion of
Lot 2154-A;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) the area of 24,385 square meters had actually been surveyed and
segregated by a private surveyor from the western portion, after which it had
been conveyed to the plaintiffs -- the acquiescence of the plaintiffs to this
fact placing them in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to later claim any
rights over the property;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">the</span>
plaintiffs are guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, not having filed the
action until after the lapse of more than ten (10) years from the sale, and six
(6) years from the time they supposedly learned of the sale they claimed to be
fictitious.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The defendants (<span class="SpellE">Jaticos</span>)
set up a counterclaim for moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already pointed out, the Trial Court -- and the Intermediate
Appellate Court -- found the plaintiffs, the <span class="SpellE">Dongcos</span>,
to have acted in bad faith, their allegations shown to be false by the
evidence, and decreed that not only should their complaint be dismissed but
they should be sentenced as well, to pay damages to the defendant spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Courts concluded from the recorded
proofs that, contrary to the <span class="SpellE">Dongcos</span>' pretenses, the
"Extrajudicial Partition with Power to Sell" and the "Deed of
Absolute Sale" were voluntary acts on their part, untainted by mistake,
ignorance, fraud or other improper circumstance, and having, in addition, been
acknowledged before a notary public with the attendant formalities <span style="">prescribed by law, had in their favor the
presumption of regularity in the performance of function by a public officer,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""> the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span>
acknowledgments being, too, prima facie evidence of the due execution of the
documents, rendering them admissible in evidence without further proof.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the modest award of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
for moral damages is not only supported by the evidence but also eminently
reasonable in the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record contains testimony of respondent <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jatico</span>, never contradicted, to the effect that, being at
the time a third-term councilor of his town, a member of the
"Jaycees," and a director and treasurer of the Mindanao Christians
Foundation, the filing of the <span class="SpellE">Dongcos</span>' complaint
greatly embarrassed and humiliated him in the community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also caused his wife and co-defendant,
then a school teacher who had served several terms as treasurer of the District
Association, to suffer shock and hypertension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Equally merited and reasonable are the awards for exemplary damages and
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Decision of the Intermediate
Appellate Court is AFFIRMED in all respects, with costs against the
