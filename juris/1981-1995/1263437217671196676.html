				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is an appeal from the joint decision of the Regional Trial
Court, Branch 2, <span class=SpellE>Bangued</span>, <span class=SpellE>Abra</span>,
in Criminal Cases Nos. 442 and 443, convicting Ruben <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>
<u>alias</u> &quot;<span class=SpellE>Amben</span>&quot; and <span
class=SpellE>Zosimo</span> <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> <u>alias </u>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>Samong</span>&quot; of murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code). The <span
class=SpellE>dispositive</span> portion of the assailed decision reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHEREFORE, the Court finds both accused in Criminal Cases
Nos. 442 and 443 guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as
defined and penalized in Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the killing of <span
class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span> in Criminal Case
No. 442 being qualified by treachery and taking advantage of superior strength
with the aggravating circumstance of nighttime; while the killing of Pedro <span
class=SpellE>Espiritu</span> in Criminal Case No. 443 is qualified by treachery
with the aggravating circumstance of nighttime, with no mitigating
circumstances proven in both cases, and sentences them to suffer the penalty of
<u>reclusion</u> <span class=SpellE><u>perpetua</u></span> and to indemnify the
families of their victims the amount of P100,000.00 each, and to pay the costs
of these proceedings&quot; (<span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p. 25).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The information filed in Criminal Case No. 442 against the
accused Ruben <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;That on or about July 13, 1986, at about 7:00 o'clock at
night, at <span class=SpellE>Barangay</span> <span class=SpellE>Patoc</span>, in
the municipality of <span class=SpellE>Bucay</span>, Province of <span
class=SpellE>Abra</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery
and evident premeditation and while armed with a sharp-pointed bolo, did then
and there, <span class=SpellE>wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously
assault, attack and stab one <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> <span
class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>, an 8 year-old child, hitting her on her abdominal
cavity and on other parts of her body, which multiple stab wounds caused her
death shortly thereafter&quot; (<span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p. 18).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The information filed in Criminal Case No. 443 against the
accused <span class=SpellE>Zosimo</span> <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span>
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;That on or about July 13, 1986, at about 7:00 o'clock at
night, at <span class=SpellE>Barangay</span> <span class=SpellE>Patoc</span>,
in the municipality of <span class=SpellE>Bucay</span>, Province of <span
class=SpellE>Abra</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery
and evident premeditation and while armed with a sharp-pointed bolo, did then
and there, <span class=SpellE>wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously
assault, attack and stab one Pedro <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>, hitting
him on his neck, which stab wound caused his death shortly thereafter&quot; (<span
class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 18-19).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>At his arraignment, appellant <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>
manifested his willingness to plead guilty to the lesser offense of homicide in
Criminal Case No. 442, and to assume responsibility to the charge in Criminal
Case No. 443, but these manifestations were not accepted by the trial court
(Order, March 5, 1988; TSN, August 18, 1987, p. 2).</p>

<p class=BODY>The arraignments proceeded with both appellants pleading not guilty.
The two cases were tried jointly &quot;because of their proximity of time and
place of occurrence&quot; (Decision, p. 2; <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p.
19).</p>

<p class=BODY>The records in the two cases show that at about <st1:time
Hour="19" Minute="0">7:00 P.M.</st1:time> of <st1:date Month="7" Day="13"
Year="1986">July 13, 1986</st1:date>, <span class=SpellE>Talledo</span> <span
class=SpellE>Espiritu</span> was at his house waiting for his 17-year old son,
Pedro, to come home from the fields. Pedro suddenly appeared at the door, with
a gaping wound on his neck and blood stains all over his clothes. Embracing his
father, Pedro told him that he was stabbed by &quot;<span class=SpellE>Samong</span>&quot;,
referring to <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span>. After identifying his
assailant, Pedro collapsed and he died a few moments later. <span class=SpellE>Talledo</span>
then shouted for help.</p>

<p class=BODY>At about the same time, the screams of a child were heard.
Domingo <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>, a next-door neighbor of <span
class=SpellE>Talledo</span>, ran outside his house to where the screams were
coming from. He saw his eight-year old granddaughter, <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span>
<span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>, squatting on the ground about three meters
from <span class=SpellE>Talledo's</span> house. Domingo saw appellants running
away from the scene, with <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> heading towards
the direction of the house of <span class=SpellE>Saturnina</span> <span
class=SpellE>Belaras</span>. <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> told Domingo
that she was stabbed by &quot;'<span class=SpellE>Nong</span> <span
class=SpellE>Amben</span>&quot;, referring to <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Estefana</span> <span class=SpellE>Tubana</span>,
the adoptive mother of <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> and who rushed to her
succor, was told by <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> that she saw <span
class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> stab Pedro and that appellants chased her upon
noticing her presence.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Saturnina</span> <span class=SpellE>Belaras</span>,
a neighbor of <span class=SpellE>Talledo's</span>, was washing dishes when
someone tried to forcibly open the door of her house. When she opened the door,
<span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> entered and talked with <span class=SpellE>Saturnina's</span>
son. <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> did not stay long and hurriedly left
the house when shouts for help were heard.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> died the following day,
succumbing to five wounds.</p>

<p class=OTHERHEADING><u>Criminal Case No. 442<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> admitted before the trial
court to killing both <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>
and Pedro <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>. He testified that he went to see
Pedro to confront him about the latter's attempt to electrocute <span
class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>' sister with an electric fishing device. Pedro
reacted by unsheathing his bolo and attacking <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>,
who was able to parry the attack and stab Pedro. He claimed that after the
traumatic incident, he was possessed by a state of mind that bordered on
insanity overpowered by a force beyond his control. This was his explanation of
why he stabbed <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> who happened to cross his path
(<span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>' Brief, pp. 4-5, 7-9; <span
class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 82-83, 85-87).</p>

<p class=BODY>In this appeal, <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> asserts
that he should have been exempted from liability on the ground of insanity and
of having acted under the compulsion of an irresistible force.</p>

<p class=BODY>Insanity was not invoked as a defense by <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>
in the trial <span class=GramE>court .</span> <span class=GramE>and</span> no
evidence was presented to overcome the presumption of sanity. It is too late on
appeal to raise the defense of insanity (People v. <span class=SpellE>Yagong</span>,
181 SCRA 479 [1990]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The evidence on record does not show any outward act of <span
class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>, indicating his <span class=GramE>&quot;complete
deprivation of intelligence&quot; nor &quot;total</span> deprivation of freedom
of the will.&quot; On the other hand, as pointed out by the Solicitor General, <span
class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> was able to give a lucid account of the series
of events, from the moment he crossed path with <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span>
to the moment he stabbed her (Consolidated Brief for the <span class=SpellE>Appellee</span>,
pp. 28-31; <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 164-167). He was able to
describe the bolo he had used and to demonstrate how he used it (TSN, August*
25, 1988, pp. 23-24).</p>

<p class=BODY>There is also no showing in the record which would lead this
Court to a finding that <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> had acted under
the compulsion of an irresistible force.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> further contends that he
should have been convicted of homicide, not murder, and that the mitigating
circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed
and the mitigating circumstance of passion or obfuscation, should have been
appreciated in his favor.</p>

<p class=BODY>He alleges that he stabbed <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span>
without any intention of killing her but merely to stop her from screaming. He
points out that <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> did not suffer any mortal
wound as shown by the fact that after being stabbed, she was still strong
enough to assume a squatting position and even answer questions asked her by
Domingo <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>. He further claims that <span
class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span> did not die as a result of the stabbing but of
shock and internal hemorrhage secondary to her wounds (<span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>'
Brief, pp. 10-13, <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 88-91).</p>

<p class=BODY>Contrary to the claim of <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>,
the evidence shows that he intended to kill <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span>.
He used a bolo to inflict five incisions and penetrating wounds on the head and
torso of <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span>, a mere eight-year old child. The
mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong as that
committed cannot be appreciated where the acts employed by the accused were
reasonably sufficient to produce the result that they actually produced - the
death of the victim (People v. <span class=SpellE>Amit</span>, 32 SCRA 95
[1970]).</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> asserts that Pedro's
alleged act of attempting to electrocute <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>'
sister, Pedro's alleged unlawful aggression, and <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn's</span>
screams produced the passion and obfuscation that deprived him of the time for
reflection (<span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>' Brief, pp. 13-15; <span
class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 91-93).</p>

<p class=BODY>The circumstance of passion and obfuscation is not mitigating
when the accused acted in a spirit of lawlessness. Besides, the screams of an
eight-year old child are not provocative enough to generate a sudden impulse of
natural and uncontrolled fury (People v. <span class=SpellE>Caliso</span>, 58
Phil. 283 [1933]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The trial court convicted <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>
of murder qualified by treachery and taking advantage of superior strength and
aggravated by nighttime.</p>

<p class=BODY>The trial court is correct in finding <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>
guilty of murder qualified by treachery. Killing a child is characterized by
treachery even if the manner of the assault is not shown because the weakness
of the victim due to her tender age results in the absence of any danger to the
accused (People v. <span class=SpellE>Ganohon</span>, 196 SCRA 431 [1991]).</p>

<p class=BODY>However, taking advantage of superior strength was not alleged as
a qualifying circumstance in the information and, therefore, it cannot be
properly appreciated as such. Neither can it be appreciated as a generic
circumstance because it is absorbed in treachery.</p>

<p class=BODY>Nighttime cannot be properly appreciated against <span
class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> because there is no evidence to show that he
purposely sought this circumstance to commit the crime or to facilitate the
commission of the crime (People v. De Los Reyes, 203 SCRA 707 [1991]). Granting
that nighttime attended the commission of the crime, this circumstance is also
absorbed in treachery.</p>

<p class=OTHERHEADING><u>Criminal Case No. 443<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class=BODY>To bolster his defense of alibi, <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span>
relies on <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>' testimony in open court
admitting that he, not <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span>, was the one who
stabbed to death Pedro <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span>. <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span>
points to this testimony of <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>, his lack of
motive to kill Pedro and the dimly-lit place of the stabbing, which made
identification difficult, as sufficient grounds to negate the weight of the
dying declaration of Pedro (<span class=SpellE>Antiporda's</span> Brief, pp.
6-9; <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 40-43).</p>

<p class=BODY>The trial court dismissed <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>'
version of the killing of Pedro as a &quot;shallow concoction and confabulation
to save the neck of his cousin and constant companion, accused <span
class=SpellE>Zosimo</span> <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> in Criminal Case
No. 443&quot; (Decision, p. 4; <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p. 21).</p>

<p class=BODY>The version of <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span> is
uncorroborated and is contradicted by the evidence of the prosecution,
principally the dying declaration of Pedro that he was stabbed by <span
class=SpellE>Antiporda</span>, not by <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>.
The dying declaration of <span class=SpellE>Jonalyn</span>, as told to <span
class=SpellE>Estefana</span> <span class=SpellE>Tubana</span>, also pointed to <span
class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> as the assailant of Pedro.</p>

<p class=BODY>The trial court found no reason to doubt the credibility of Pedro
in making his <u>ante</u> <u>mortem </u>declaration and that of <span
class=SpellE>Talledo</span> <span class=SpellE>Espiritu</span> in conveying
said declaration (Decision, p. 7; <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p. 24). We
find no reason to depart from the rule that the findings of the trial court on
the credibility of witnesses are given the highest degree of respect by the
appellate court (People v. <span class=SpellE>Saulo</span>, 211 SCRA 888
[1992]).</p>

<p class=BODY>Anent the defense of alibi, this defense is unavailing where
there is affirmative evidence of the presence of the accused at the scene of
the crime at the time of its commission (People v. Plaza, 140 SCRA 277 [1985];
People v. <span class=SpellE>Pigon</span>, 173 SCRA 607 [1989]).</p>

<p class=BODY>Lack of motive does not preclude conviction when the crime and
the participation of the accused therein are definitely established (People v. <span
class=SpellE>Caranzo</span>, 209 SCRA 232 [1992]).</p>

<p class=BODY>We find, however, that the trial court erred in appreciating the
circumstance of treachery, which it considered to qualify the crime to murder.
Treachery cannot be appreciated in the absence of evidence of the mode of
attack; it cannot be presumed, but must be proved positively (People v. <span
class=SpellE>Quilaton</span>, 205 SCRA 279 [1992]).</p>

<p class=BODY>Nighttime cannot be properly appreciated against <span
class=SpellE>Antiporda</span>, there being no evidence that it was purposely
sought by him to commit the offense (People v. De Los Reyes, 203 SCRA 707
[1991]).</p>

<p class=BODY>Consequently, <span class=SpellE>Antiporda</span> can only be
convicted of homicide, with no modifying circumstance.</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of
the foregoing, the decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED with the following
modifications:</p>

<p class=BODY>In Criminal Case No. 442, appellant Ruben <span class=SpellE>Cabarrubias</span>

FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50<span class=GramE>,000.00</span>) as indemnity.</p>

<p class=BODY>In Criminal Case No. 443, appellant <span class=SpellE>Zosimo</span>
