				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The restoration of the right to strike is the most valuable gain
of labor after the EDSA revolution.  It
is the employees’ sole weapon which can effectively protect their basic rights
especially in a society where the levers of powers are nearly monopolized by
the propertied few or their franchisees.  In recognition of its importance, our Constitution has accorded the
right to strike a distinct status while our laws have assured that its rightful
exercise will not be negated by the issuance of unnecessary injunctions.  The impugned Order of the public respondents
in the case at bar infringes petitioners’ right to strike and hence must be
struck down.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor conflict between the parties broke out in the open when
the petitioner union<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
struck on April 6, 1992 protesting issues ranging from unfair labor practices
and union busting allegedly committed by the private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The union picketed the premises of the private respondent at Bagumbayan and
Longos in Quezon City; Angono and Antipolo in Rizal; San Fernando, Pampanga and
San Pedro, Laguna.</p>

<p class="BODY">The strike hurt the private respondent.  On April 8, 1992, it filed with the NLRC a petition for
injunction<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to stop the strike which it denounced as illegal.  It alleged:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“13.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 6, 1992, at
around 7:00 P.M., respondents led by its officers and some members staged a
wild-cat strike, without a valid notice of strike, nor observing cooling-off
period, and made even during the pendency of a preventive<span style=""> mediation proceedings which was still
scheduled for April 10, 1992;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“14.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And during the said
wild-cat strike, respondents have set-up makeshifts, tents, banners and
streamers and other man-made obstructions at the main plant and offices of
petitioner which effectively impeding, as in fact still effectively impeding
the ingress and egress of persons who have lawful business with the petitioner;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“15.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
respondents have resorted, as in fact still resorting to, unlawful and illegal
acts including among others threats, intimidations and coercions against
persons who have lawful business with the petitioner and the non-striking
employees who wish to return to work;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“16.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">Without complying with the legal </span>requirements for a valid
strike, respondents’ staging of the said ‘wild-cat strike’, is by law
considered as illegal or unlawful act which must be enjoined;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“17.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a direct result of
the aforesaid unlawful and illegal acts of the respondents, petitioner which
has on-going projects for the government and other private entities which
require completion on and agreed schedule, is at great and imminent danger to
suffer substantial damages and injury, which if not urgently redressed, will
inevitably become irreparable;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“18.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Said prohibited and
unlawful acts have been threatened and will continuously be committed unless
the injunction or temporary restraining order be issued against the
respondents; (pp. 2-5, Records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“23.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The injury and damages
to the government of Republic of the Philippines, the petitioner and other
persons are unavoidable, so much so that the issuance of a Temporary
Restraining Order without notice becomes imperative, as the police officers or
agents of authority called upon to enforce the right to ingress and egress are
unable to do so; (p. 6, ibid)”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petition was set for hearing on April
13, 1992 <span style="">at </span>3 p.m.  The union, however, claimed that it was not
furnished a copy of the petition.  Allegedly, the company misrepresented its address to be at Rm. 205-6
Herald Bldg., Muralla St., Intramuros, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 13, 1992, the NLRC heard the evidence of the company
alone.  The <u>ex</u> <u>p</u><u><span style="">arte</span></u><span style=""> </span>hearing started at 2:30 p.m. where testimonial and documentary

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Before the day was over, the respondent NLRC
(First Division) issued a temporary restraining order against the union, <u>viz</u>:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span style="">x x </span>RESOLVED, to
issue a Temporary Restraining Order valid for twenty (20) days, subject to
petitioner’s posting of a cash or surety bond of Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos
conditioned to recompense respondents for any loss, expense or damage they may
suffer in the event it is eventually found out that petitioner is not entitled
to the relief sought and herein <span style="">granted, DIRECTING:  a) the respondents, their agents and symphatizers
to remove (subject to their right to conduct a lawful picket) the man­made
barricades/obstructions complained of and to direct from further preventing
and/or impeding the free ingress to and egress from petitioner’s main plant and
office premises of its employees, officials, vehicles, customers or any party
who may want to transact business thereat through the use of any obstructive
means prohibited by law; b) any officer from the Legal Division of this
Commission to ensure compliance of the foregoing restraining order and where
necessary, to enlist in the implementation of this Order, as deputized
enforcement officers, the assistance of peace officers of this government that
has jurisdiction over the strike areas; c) Labor Arbiter Ernilo V. Penalosa to
immediately set this case for further hearing with the aim of affording
respondents enough opportunity to contest/oppose the issuance of
temporary/permanent injunction prayed for in the petition and to submit a
report to this Commission within ten (10) days from termination of said
hearing”.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">No copy of this Order was furnished the
union.  The union learned of the Order
only when it was posted on April 15, 1992 at the premises of the company.  On April 21, 1992, it filed its
Opposition/Answer to the petition <span style="">for </span>Injunction.  Among others, it alleged:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The allegation in paragraph 13 of an alleged illegal
strike for the reasons stated therein <span style="">is
denied.  It is </span>also added that
the question of strike legality is outside the original jurisdiction of the
NLRC except if the <span style="">labor dispute has
been certified to it for compulsory arbitration.  Hence, not only is paragraph 13 denied, denial is made likewise
of paragraph 16 which asks that the strike must be enjoined.  Paragraph 16 is irrelevant to the cause of
action in injunction because only the illegal or unlawful acts maybe
enjoined.  The strike itself cannot be
enjoined unless certified by the honorable Secretary of Labor to the NLRC for
compulsory arbitration.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraphs 14, 15, 17,
18, and 19 of the allegations supporting the cause of action are also denied <span style="">for </span>being self-serving and premature.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“10.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondents also deny
the allegation in paragraph 20 as the public officers charged with the duty to
protect the petitioner’s property are able and willing to furnish adequate
protection as shown by the fact that when the temporary restraining order was
served, the police and other law enforcement agency personnel came immediately
to respond and enforced the order peacefully”.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On April 24, 1992, the union also filed
its own Petition for Injunction to enjoin the company “from asking the aid of
the police and the military officer in escorting scabs to enter the struck
establishment.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the case was heard on April 24 and 30, May
4 and 5, 1992 by respondent Labor Arbiter Enrilo Peñalosa.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> On
April 30, 1992, the company filed a Motion for the Immediate Issuance of
Preliminary Injunction wherein it <span style="">alleged:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the
respondents are still committing illegal acts, by resorting to grave threats,
intimidation against the non­-striking employees and persons with lawful
transactions with the company since April 20, 1992, continuously up to this
time, either by actual threats and intimidation whenever these persons attempt
to report to work or transact business with the company, or by calling at their
houses or places of residence, and then and there coerce not to report for work
on pain of bodily harm; As proof thereof, petitioner attaches the affidavit of
Atty. Elmer Jolo, Augusto Bautista, Ronnie Mercado, among others, as Annexes
“A”, “B” &amp; “C” and made integral parts thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons,
said workers and persons are constrained to refrain from reporting for work or
from transacting business with the company;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, no less than
the president of the Union, supported by the leaders of the strikers,
threatened that upon the expiration of the validity of the temporary
restraining order, they will <u>‘sisimentuhin</u> <u>namin</u> <u>ang</u> <u>gates</u>
<u>ng</u> <u>Concrete</u> <u>Aggregates</u> <u>na</u> <u>kahit</u> i<u>pis</u> <u>ay</u>
<u>hindi</u> <u>makakapasok</u> <u>at</u> <u>makakalabas’</u> (‘We will cement
the gates of the Concrete Aggregates that even cockroaches could not pass
through’);”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The union got wind of the motion only on
May 4, 1992.  The next days, May 5,
1992, it opposed the motion, alleging:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They were never furnished by the petitioner with a copy of the
original petition for injunction filed on April 8, 1992 because as seen from
the petition, petitioner addressed the respondents at Rm. 205-206 Herald Bldg.,
Muralla St., <span style="">Manila as stated in <u>paragraph</u>
</span><u>2</u> of the said petition and they came to know only of the same <span style="">when
Commission issued a temporary restraining order dated April 15, 1992 which was
served to them at the picket line on April 15, 1992 and thus they opposed the
same on April 20, 1992 (pp. 99-100, Records).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x.  The suspicion is
that same is deliberate in order for the union not to be able to immediately
oppose the petition praying for a temporary restraining order and so petitioner
was scot-free when it presented <u>ex-parte</u> evidence.  The motion for the immediate issuance of a
preliminary injunction foisted upon the Honorable Commisssion with affidavits
of employees debunked by cross-examination and officers of the company making
fantastic claims is an attempt to have lightning strike twice at the same
place.  We hope this Honorable
Commission is not fooled and therefore we beseech it to examine carefully the
pleadings and the transcript on this question of threat or prohibited acts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The allegation of damages if no injunction is secured is therefore
premature and irrelevant in this proceedings because there is no proof that the
strike is illegal.  For if the strike is
legal then both sides must bear their own losses in an economic contest:  the company - loss of income; the workers -
loss of wages.  These are the stakes in
an economic dispute.  The desperate
company posture to enjoin even the strike itself is shown by its letter to the
Secretary of Labor dated April 6, 1992, a copy of which is hereto attached as <u>Annex</u>
<u>“A”</u>.  The Secretary of Labor has
not yet <span style="">acted
on this request.  The company believes
probably that an injunction petition would substitute the provision of Art. 263
of the Labor Code.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The same day, however, the respondent
NLRC issued its disputed Order<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
granting the company’s motion for <span style="">preliminary
injunction.  It reads:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“It appears that despite the issuance of a temporary restraining
order on April 14, 1991, the respondents have not ceased in committing the
illegal acts being enjoined.  As shown
by petitioner during the hearings of its main petition for preliminary and/or
permanent injunction, held on the first day of the implementation of the
temporary restraining order on April 20, 1992 and the day thereafter,
respondents, thru the formation of human blockade, have prevented the company
vehicles and Employees’ Shuttle Buses from entering the company premises, and
through force and intimidation made the non­-striking employees on board the
vehicles and buses to get down:  that
even the company’s Assistant Manager for Operations, Mr. Ronnie Mercado, who
tried to help the non-striking employees to enter the company premises was
blocked by the strikers and was even told “wala kaming pakialam sa restraining
order ninyo, basta hindi namin papapasukin para magtrabaho ang sino mang
empleyado ng Concrete Aggregates.  Bubugbugin namin kayo pag kayo nagpilit.” He was further told that “Ikaw
Mercado huwag kang mapapel dito baka my mangyari sa iyo.” As a result of the
said blockade, threats and intimidation, more or less 100 non-striking
employees now, have not been able to report for work; moreover, the inability
of the company’s Longos Plant to operate fully had caused it to lose the
contracted RMC Sales of around 10,000 cubic meters worth around P10 million,
not to mention the expected loss in sales for the next three (3) months at P14
million per month since no customers, regular or prospective, could transact
business with the company.  But foremost
of all, it has been shown that no less than the President of the Union, Ramos
Banas, with the support of the leaders of the strikers, has threatened that
upon the expiration of the validity of the temporary restraining order on May
5, 1992, they will not only barricade the gates of the company but even seal them
all so that “even cockroaches could not pass through.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While respondents witnesses, who were mentioned in the
testimonies/affidavits of petitioner’s witnesses, tried to deny the illegal
acts imputed against them, the fact remains undisputed that when the convoy of
the company cars and Employees Shuttle Buses with reporting non-striking
employees on board were about to enter the compound of the company’s Longos
Plant in Quezon City, they were stopped by the respondents on the lame excuse
that they were only to inquire as to who were those on board and that they
asked those who are allegedly non employees of the petitioner to get down.  It has been substantially established that
out of the work force of the Longos Plant, about 100 more or less employees
have not been able to enter the plant premises from April 20, 1991 up to the
present, for fear of bodily harm from the strikers.  Likewise, if it were true, as claimed, that no threats and
intimidation were committed against the company officials who were to report
for work, then there is no reason why the Manager for Operations, Ronnie
Mercado, should be complaining to the police nearby and for the latter to
advise respondents Ramon Banas and Ernest Lascona behave well.  Moreover, there is merit to the claim of
petitioner that even contract workers hired by it who, even before the strike
and up to the present, were assigned to work inside the premises of the Longos
were denied entrance by the strikers for their being alleged scabs.  With this admission regarding the contract
worker, there is reason to believe the truth and veracity of the statement as
of petitioner’s witnesses, especially the reasonable fear that after the lapse
of the twenty (20) days duration of the temporary restraining order, the
respondents-strikers will again resort to barricading the entrances of
petitioner’s plants to prevent <u>anyone</u> from entering the said plants’
premises.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On the bases of all the foregoing facts and circumstances, the
First Division of this Commission, after due deliberation hereby RESOLVED:  (pending conclusion of the hearing on
petitioner’s main petition of April 24, 1991), to issue preliminary
injunction:  a) enjoining the
respondents, their representative and symphatizers, if any, without prejudice
to their right to conduct a peaceful and lawful picket, from preventing the
non-striking employees, officials of the company and their vehicles, customers
and visitors free ingress to and egress from petitioner’s plant and premises;
directing them to make the ingress to and egress from said premises free from
any and all obstruction at all times; and requiring them to desist from further
threatening and intimidating at their houses or elsewhere the non-striking
employees who up to now could not report for work and to allow them to report
for work unmolested:  b) directing them,
despite the union president’s statement that none of the feared illegal acts
will be committed after the lapse of the temporary restraining order, to <span style="">refrain
from doing any illegal act which will exacerbate the situation upon the
expiration of the temporary restraining order:  c) applying the cash or surety bond of P20,</span><span style="">000.00 </span><span style="">posted by
petitioner for the temporary restraining order that will expire on May 5, 1992
as the case or surety bond for this preliminary injunction:  d) deputizing any officer from the Legal
Division of this Commission to effectively enforce and implement this
injunctive order and, if necessary, to enlist the assistance of the PNP or
other peace officers having jurisdiction over the strike areas in the
enforcement and implementation of this Order.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Let two (2) copies of this injunctive order be posted in two (2)
conspicuous places of each of the strike areas by the Bailiff of this
Commission for the information and proper guidance of all concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The union then filed the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> raising the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the

the motion for immediate issuance of preliminary injunction of private

<p class="BODY">We find for the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Strike has been considered the most effective weapon of labor in
protecting the rights of employees to improve the terms and conditions of their
employment.  It may be that in highly
developed countries, the <span style="">significance </span>of
strike as a coercive weapon has shrunk in view of the preference for more
peaceful modes of settling labor disputes.  In underdeveloped countries, however, where the economic crunch
continues to enfeeble the already marginalized working class, the importance of
the right to strike remains undiminished as indeed it has proved many a time as
the only coercive weapon that can correct abuses against labor.  It remains as the great equalizer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Philippine milieu where social justice remains more as a
rhetoric than a reality, labor has vigilantly fought to safeguard the sanctity
of the right to strike.  Its struggle to
gain the right to strike has not been easy and effortless.  Labor’s early exercise of the right to
strike collided with the laws on rebellion and sedition and sent its leaders
languishing in prisons.  The spectre of
incarceration did not spur its leaders to sloth; on the contrary it spiked
labor to work for its legitimization.  This effort was enhanced by the flowering of liberal ideas in the United
States which inevitably crossed our shores.  It was enormously boosted by the American occupation of our
country.  Hence, on June 17, 1953,
Congress gave statutory recognition to the right to strike when it enacted RA
875, otherwise known as the Industrial Peace Act.  For nearly two <span style="">(2)
decades, labor enjoyed the right to strike until it </span>was prohibited on
September 12, 1972 upon the declaration of martial law in the country.  The 14-year battle to end martial rule
produced many martyrs and foremost among them were the radicals of the labor
movement.  It was not a mere
happenstance, therefore, that after the final battle against martial rule was
fought at EDSA in 1986, the new government treated labor with a favored
eye.  Among those chosen by then
President Corazon C. Aquino to draft the 1987 Constitution were recognized
labor leaders like Eulogio Lerum, Jose D. Calderon, Blas D. Ople and Jaime S.L.
Tadeo.  These delegates helped craft
into the 1987 Constitution its Article XIII entitled Social Justice and Human
Rights.  For the first time in our
constitutional history, the fundamental law of our land mandated the State to
“… guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective
bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, <u>including</u>
<u>the</u> <u>right</u> <u>to</u> <u>strike</u> <u>in</u> <u>accordance</u> <u>with</u>
<u>law</u>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This constitutional imprimatur given to the right to strike constitutes signal
victory for labor.  Our Constitutions of
1935 and 1973 did not accord constitutional status to the right to strike.  Even the <span style="">liberal US Federal Constitution did not
elevate the right to </span>strike to a constitutional level.  With a constitutional matrix, enactment of a
law implementing the right to strike was an inevitability.  RA 6715 came into being on March 21,<span style="">1989, an intentional replication of
RA 875.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In light of the genesis of the
right to strike, it ought to be obvious that the right should be read with a
libertarian latitude in favor of labor.  In the wise words of Father Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J., a distinguished
commissioner of the 1987 Constitutional Commission “x x x the constitutional
recognition of the right to strike does serve as a reminder that injunctions,
should be reduced to the barest minimum”.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Comments of the private and public
respondents did not dispute the correctness of these documentary and
testimonial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the records reveal the continuing misuse of unfair
strategies to secure <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> temporary restraining orders
against striking employees.  Petitioner
union did not receive any copy of private respondent’s petition for injunction
in Case No. 000249-92 filed on April 8, 1992.  Its address as alleged by the private respondent turned out to be
“erroneous”.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the petitioner was denied the right to attend the hearing held on
April 13, 1992 while the private respondent enjoyed a field day presenting its <span style="">evidence <u>ex</u>
<u>parte</u>.  On the basis of
uncontested evidence, </span>the public respondent, on the same day April 13,
1992, temporarily enjoined the petitioner from committing certain alleged
illegal acts.  Again, a copy of the
Order was sent to the wrong address of the petitioner.  Knowledge of the Order came to the
petitioner only when its striking members read it after it was posted at the
struck areas of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the issuance of an <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> temporary
restraining order in a labor dispute is not <u>per</u> <u>se</u>
prohibited.  Its issuance, however,
should be characterized by care and caution for the law requires that it be
clearly justified by considerations of extreme necessity, i.e., when the
commission of unlawful acts is causing substantial and irreparable injury to
company properties and the company is, for the moment, bereft of an adequate remedy
at law.  This is as it ought to be, for
imprudently issued temporary restraining orders can break the back of employees
engaged in a legal strike.  Often times,
they unduly tilt the balance of a labor warfare in favor of capital.  When that happens, the deleterious effects
of a wrongfully issued, <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> temporary restraining order on
the rights of striking employees can no longer be repaired for they defy simple
monetization.  Moreover, experience
shows that <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> applications for restraining orders are often
based on fabricated facts and concealed truths.  A more becoming sense of fairness, therefore, demands that such <u>ex</u>
<u>parte</u> applications should be more minutely examined by hearing officers,
lest, our constitutional policy of protecting labor becomes nothing but a
synthetic shibboleth.  The immediate
need to hear and resolve these <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> applications does not
provide any excuse to lower our vigilance in protecting labor against the
issuance of indiscriminate injunctions.  Stated otherwise, it behooves hearing officers receiving evidence in
support of <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u><span style="">
injunctions against employees in strike to take a more active stance in seeing
to it that their right to social justice </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">in no way violated despite their absence.  This equalizing stance was not taken in the
case at bar by the public respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor do we find baseless the allegation by petitioner that the
public respondents have neglected to resolve with reasonable dispatch its own
Petition for Injunction with prayer for a temporary restraining order dated
April 25, 1992.  The petition invoked
Article 264 (d) of the Labor Code<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> to
enjoin the private respondent from using the military and police authorities to
escort scabs at the <span style="">struck
establishment.  Sadly contrasting is the
haste with which public respondents heard and acted on a similar petition for
injunction filed by the private respondent.  In the case of the private respondent, its prayer for an <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u>
temporary restraining order was heard on April 13, 1992 and it was granted on
the same day.  Its petition for
preliminary injunction was filed on April 30, 1992, and was granted on May 5,
1992.  In the case of petitioner, its
petition for injunction was filed on April 24, 1992, and to date, the records
do not reveal whether the public respondent has granted or denied the
same.  The disparate treatment is
inexplicable considering that the subject matters of their petition are of
similar importance to the parties and to the public.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
