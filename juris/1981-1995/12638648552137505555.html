Jr. and Ernesto Toledo stood at a distance of about three (3) meters away from
them waiting for Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adique</span>. When <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> was about to leave

grappled and struggled for the gun. It was at this juncture when the revolver

<p class="BODY">A careful reading of the testimonies of the eyewitnesses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">shows </span>that the prosecution witnesses
and defense witnesses were equally direct and positive in their narrations of
what really happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, we should give full faith and credit to what the
trial judge declares regarding the respective merits of the two versions of the
same incident. As the Solicitor-General points out, the trial court's findings
carry great weight far it had the privilege of examining the deportment and
demeanor of witnesses and, therefore, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">could
</span>discern whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>not-such
witnesses are telling the truth. (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>
147 SCRA 102 [1987]) There are however, matters of weight and substance which
the trial court overlooked and which, if taken into account, would result in
findings different from the conclusions in the challenged decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court discussed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in
</span>detail the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and those of the
defense on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>circumstances
immediately surrounding the shooting itself. However, instead of reconciling <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>a more convincing manner the
unexplained discrepancies in its conclusions which lead to reasonable doubts,
the court appeared to have been more strongly influenced by incidents and
matters which happened outside of the killing itself. Among them are the
extrajudicial statements given to police investigators, the contents of a
petition for certiorari questioning an order incident to the grant of bail, the
absence of motive for the killing, and the alleged flight of the <span class="GramE">accused.</span> These latter matters are also important but they
should not overshadow the killing itself. Considering that there are two
conflicting versions which are both plausible and, if one <span class="GramE">is</span>
taken without the other, equally convincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">One aspect of the case glossed over in the decision is that it
was Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> who had a motive to act as
aggressor, who had reason to bring a firearm back to the restaurant, and who,
therefore, pulled it out in drunken anger.</p>

<p class="BODY">Engineer <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> was at the <span class="SpellE">Sawali</span> Restaurant earlier that evening. The testimony of
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Adique</span>, Jr. inferentially corroborates the
defense evidence on some points in this regard. In his initial testimony,
Vicente, Jr. testified that he was with Alfredo from <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 P.M.</st1:time> up to the shooting incident about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> that same evening. They allegedly
played chess in Vicente's house, <span class="GramE">then</span> proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Sawali</span> Restaurant. (T.S.N. September 5, 1984, pp. 34-35) In
the later cross-examination, however, Vicente admitted that he first saw his brother
that night at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
when Alfredo came to his house. Vicente, Jr. noticed that Alfredo was "a
little tipsy". Asked how he arrived at<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>this conclusion, he answered. "I smell something." (T.S.N.
Oct. 1, 1984, pp. 8-9)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the defense witnesses indicates that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adigue</span> had been drinking at the <span class="SpellE">Sawali</span>
Re<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">s</span>taurant earlier that evening.
He had a heated altercation with Charlie Neo over his refusal to drink gin with
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Neo </span>after he had drunk gin with <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span>. Alfredo went to fetch his brother Vicente, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Jr., </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">an </span>alleged toughie, Ernesto Toledo. With his two companions,
Alfredo returned to the scene of the altercation. It was after confronting <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> and his two companions that the shooting happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the trial court, while no motive has been shown why <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> should shoot Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adigue</span>,
"motive is important only when there is doubt as to the identity of the
culprit."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In </span>this case,
there is doubt as to the ownership of the gun which caused the victim's death
and the circumstances surrounding the fatal firing. Motive is important from
the viewpoint of <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> who was charged with murder
and of the late Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adigue</span>, who accidentally shot
himself according to the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first three assignments of error center on the issue of how
far was the distance between <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Roy </span><span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> when
the latter was shot and how far from the gun barrel was the bullet's point of
entry on the victim's face.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the usual murder cases where there is a clear aggressor and an
unwitting victim, the applicable rule <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is
</span>that "(it) matters not how far the assailant was at the time he
shot the victim, the crucial factor being whether he did shoot the victim or
not" (People v. Trinidad G.R. Nos. 79123-25, January 9, 1989). And even if
there are variances as to measurements, conflicting testimonies on measurements
of distances are ordinarily of minor consequence. <span class="GramE">(See People
v. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> 1146 SCRA 258 [1986]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, however, distance becomes important. The appellant
contends that the trial court erred in holding that it was the examining
physician Dr. <span class="SpellE">Joselito</span> <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>
who opined that the victim was shot at a distance of about 24 inches since
there was no tattooing at the point of entry. The appellant points out that
Exhibit C - Medical Certificate, Exhibit D – Autopsy Report, Exhibit E Resident
Admitting History, and Exhibit F - Certificate of Death do not support this
conclusion of the trial court. The decision re<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">l</span>ies on the medico-legal book of Dr. Pedro Solis that if a gun
is fired six inches or less from the point of entry, there should be blackening
or tattooing at that point. The absence of tattooing would show that it was
fired from a greater distance. However, if the tattooing - its presence or
absence - was not given any attention by the examining physician, any
conclusion would be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">based on </span>a
non-existent premise.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The examining physician was aware <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>"the book of Dr. Solis of the NBI". While he
answered "yes" to a question that his autopsy report, medical
certificate, and clinical report made no finding on any blackening and
tattooing, he never positively stated that he looked for such tattooing and
that there was no such tattooing. Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rustia's</span>
testimony taken on October 5, 1984 shows that he could not determine whether
there was a fracture at the point of entry as no X-ray <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">was </span>taken and he did not open up the face. He could not state
whether the mandible was hit. He could not find any fragments of a bone that
was hit. He did not measure the size of the wound at the point of entry. And
because he did not measure the wound, he could not determine more or less the
distance of the firearm at the time it was fired at the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(T.S.N. October 5, 1984 pp.
78-83).</span> In fairness to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>, it should
be mentioned that he was a 29 year old physician, three years a resident of the
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Albay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> and immediately before
that, served a one year internship at the Philippine General Hospital. If the
resident physician did not pay attention to so many details which an NBI
medico-legal expert would have carefully noted, it would not be fair for the
trial court to conclude that his failure to note any tattooing in his reports
should be interpreted to mean that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">there
</span>was indeed no such tattooing at the point <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>entry.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was not a mere slip of the tongue or a clever <span class="SpellE">manuever</span> by the defense lawyer which led Vicente <span class="SpellE">Adique</span>, Jr. to testify in a manner, sustaining the
testimony of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Roy </span><span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> and the two eye-witnesses who testified for the
defense. The court had declared a recess.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
photographer had to be fetched. There were legal skirmishes about a <span class="SpellE">ballpen</span> being used to represent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">a </span>firearm and about the difference in height between the victim
and the interpreter who stood as the victim during the court re-enactment. A 38
caliber revolver was produced. Only then were the relative positions frozen in
a photograph. Yet when the picture was taken, Vicente had not corrected himself
or changed his testimony. He placed the tip of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">gun </span>barrel two inches away from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the </span>cheek of his brother. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(See
</span>photographs Exhibits <span class="GramE">A and</span> A-1 for the trial
court).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Reasonable doubts regarding the correctness of the finding of guilt
have basis. The trial court not only ignored the testimony of the key
prosecution witness but it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">based its </span>conclusion
on the findings of a resident physician and a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">b</span>allistics expert<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">s who</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> were</span> not present at the shooting and
whose conclusions are inconclusive and could be interpreted either way.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are other findings challenged by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The initial </span>discussion
of its conclusions by the court centers on the alleged flight of the appellant
immediately after the shooting. In fact, the incident of flight appears to have
greatly influenced the rest of the decision. According to the appellant, he was
about to help the fallen victim but he was afraid that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Vicente </span><span class="SpellE">Adigue</span>, Jr. and Ernesto Toledo
who had knives would attack him. He later fled to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
followed by his wife, because there were men threatening him. The court
discounted the alleged threats saying that <span class="SpellE">Alzaga's</span>
father is a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> chairman and prominent in the
place while his father-in-law, Judge <span class="SpellE">Protacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas is easily accessible in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
The trial court also noted that <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> was earlier
able to pacify Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> twice without fear of
the latter's companions. This may be so, if it is the prosecution's version
which is given credence. However, if it is true that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> left. <span class="SpellE">Sawali</span> Restaurant in
drunken anger, fetched his brother and another companion to avenge a resented
wrong, and was fatally shot while Roy <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> was
grappling with him for possession of his gun <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">or </span>at least to turn it away, there was reason for <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> to fear for his life. Whether intentional or
accidental, the death of <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> resulted from an
incident where <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> was the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span>only remaining participant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave credence to the prosecution evidence that
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adigue</span> and Roy <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span>
conversed in low voices and "in a somewhat friendly manner" for about
30 minutes before <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span> suddenly pulled <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> around when he was leaving and then shot him. The
shooting is inconsistent with the friendly conversation and the absence of any
motive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant argues:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Based on the foregoing, the first discernible question is why
did accused-appellant shoot the victim after they had a quiet friendly
conversation? Why did the accused-appellant shoot the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">victim on the left </span>cheek with the gun pointed upwards? If the
accused-appellant and the victim were facing each other, the most natural thing
to do was for the accused-appellant to shoot the victim in the body or on the
face with the gun pointed straight in a horizontal position, not pointing
upwards, as demonstrated by the prosecution’s two (2) eyewitnesses? If, indeed,
the victim had already turned his back from the accused-appellant, why <span class="GramE">would accused-appellant still draw the victim to face him when
accused-appellant could</span> have easily shot the victim at the back <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>his head or the back of his body?
If <span class="SpellE">accuted</span>-appellant really killed the victim, why
was there only one (1) gunshot fired? It is most unnatural for one who intends
to kill somebody to still draw the Victim, whose back is already against the
assailant, in order that he may face the assailant prior to the shooting, in
the nature of things, an assailant would conveniently shoot the victim while
his back is turned against him to facilitate the killing with ease." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 138-139)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his sixth assignment of error the appellant questions the
trial court's reliance on a Petition for certiorari dated <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1984</st1:date> which was filed with the Court of
Appeals. The court noted discrepancies between the statement of facts in the
1984 petition and the statements given in court by <span class="SpellE">Alzaga</span>
in 1987. The petition states there was a "rumble" while the court
testimony states there was only an "altercation." Comparing the
statement of facts in the petition with the facts given in <span class="SpellE">Alzaga's</span>
testimony, the court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"In his statement of facts, the accused stated<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that an hour later, the victim Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> came back with his group and another trouble
erupted. The petitioner came out to pacify. He talked with the deceased Alfredo
<span class="SpellE">Adique</span> who was armed and drunk to stop the trouble.
Whereas, in Court, the accused testified that he was already in the company <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of </span>Neo, <span class="SpellE">Bulawan</span>
and Perez near the <st1:place><st1:placename>YMCA</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>
outside the <span class="SpellE">SawaIi</span> Restaurant when <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> approached <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span>collared <span class="SpellE">Bulawan</span>
and pointed a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">gun </span>at him where a
struggle for the gun ensued between him <span class="SpellE">Adique</span>."
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 46)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The discrepancies are not so material as to overcome the
reasonable doubts mentioned earlier.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
petition is prepared by a lawyer who frames the statement of facts for the
petitioner. As between the version of a lawyer who was not present during the
shooting incident and the declarations made during trial in open court, it
should be the words coming from the mouth of the witness that should bind him.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">found </span>the
appellant guilty of murder aggravated by the use of an unlicensed firearm. The
evidence leading to this aggravating circumstance is a certification by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">PC </span>Captain <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Erfe</span> of the Records Branch, Firearms and
Explosives Unit, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Aizaga</span> is not a firearm licensee <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">of </span>any kind and caliber. The finding based on the above-stated
certification ignores the possibility that the firearm belonged to the victim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and, </span>therefore, could not have been
licensed in the appellant's name. The gun which killed the victim was never
recovered. According to the defense, the gun was picked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">up </span>by the victim's companion, Ernesto Toledo, who ran away with
it. The appellant summarizes in his 97 paged brief other flaws of the
questioned decision as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution's evidence is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">incomplete</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span>The
medico-legal expert failed to report on the matter of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tattooing</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>on the point of entry which is crucial to<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the determination of the distance of
the gun when it was fired and the point of entry on the victim's left cheek.
Worse, there was <u>no</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paraffin</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>test</u> </span>conducted on the victim
to find out whether or not the victim did or did not fire the gun. Absent the
foregoing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>version of the
defense becomes credible to sustain reasonable doubt at the very least.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The prosecution evidence is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">inconclusive</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span>In
fact, the two (2) eyewitnesses lend credence to the version of the defense that
the victim accidentally shot himself while grappling, for the gun with
accused-appellant when the gun was two (2) to three (3) inches away from the
point of entry. (Please see TSN., Vicente <span class="SpellE">Adique</span> and
Ernesto Toledo, supra; Exhibits "0" &amp; "0-1"
Prosecution; Exhibits "10", "10-A" up to "10­E"
inclusive-Defense; Exhibits "A" &amp; "A-1", "B"
&amp; "B-1"-Court.) Consistent with the accidental killing, it was therefore
understandable why Vicente <span class="SpellE">Adique</span>, Jr., initially
reported that the 'culprit was unknown'. (Please see Exhibits "6",
"6-A", "7" &amp; "7-A").</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The prosecution's two (2) eyewitnesses gave inconsistent
testimonies. While Vicente <span class="SpellE">Adique</span>, Jr., claims that the
victim was allegedly shot by accused-appellant at a distance of one half (1/2)
foot, -.Ernesto Toledo, however, claims that the victim was shot at a distance
of two (2) feet away from accused-appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The testimony of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Adique</span>, Jr.,
who has a stronger motive to ask for the conviction since <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>victim was his brother, on the
distance of the victim from accused?appellant as well as the gun to the
point of entry <span class="GramE">substantially</span> supports the version of
the defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trajectory of the bullet supports the theory of the
defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The opinion of the ballistician that the gun could have been
fired <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">at a </span>distance of two (2)
feet or below also supports the theory of the defense.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>unnatural
