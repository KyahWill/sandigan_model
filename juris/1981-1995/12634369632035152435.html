<p class="BODY">Section 29 of Executive Order No. 120, which took effect upon its
approval on 30 January 1987, reorganizing the then Ministry of Tourism,
provides that incumbents whose positions are not included in the new position
structure and staffing pattern or who are not reappointed are deemed separated
from the service.  Pursuant thereto, the
then Ministry of Tourism (MOT, now Department of Tourism, DOT) issued various
office orders and memoranda declaring all positions thereat vacant,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

led to the <b><span style="">Mandani, Abrogar and
Arnaldo </span></b>cases, as well as the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <b><span style="">Mandani, </span></b>we
declared null and void all office orders and memoranda issued pursuant to E.O.
120 and directed "public respondents or their successors <span style="">x x x </span>to immediately restore the
petitioners to their positions without loss of seniority rights and with back
salaries computed under the new staffing pattern from the dates of their
invalid terminations at rates not lower than their former salaries."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <b><span style="">Abrogar </span></b>and
<b><span style="">Arnaldo, </span></b>we ordered the
reinstatement of petitioners "to their former positions without loss of
seniority rights and with back salaries computed under the new staffing pattern
from the dates of their invalid dismissals at rates not lower than their former
salaries, provided, however, that no supervening event shall have occurred
which would otherwise disqualify them for such reinstatement, and provided,
further, that whatever benefits they may have received from the Government by
reason of their termination shall be reimbursed through reasonable salary
deductions."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners and intervenors claiming that they should not
be deprived of the relief granted to their former co-employees plead for
reinstatement "without loss of seniority rights and with back salaries
computed under the new staffing pattern from dates of their invalid termination
at rates not lower than their former salaries."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Decisive in this recourse is the determination of whether the
separation of herein petitioners and intervenors from service was pursuant to
office orders and memoranda declared void in <b><span style="">Mandani</span></b><span style="">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Except for petitioners Samuel Hipol, Jane Corros and Myrna
Salvador, and intervenors Concepcion Timario, Efren Fontanilla, Ascension
Padilla and Evelyn Enriquez, public respondents do not dispute that petitioners
and intervenors were unseated from the then Ministry of Tourism, pursuant to
office orders and memoranda issued under E.O. No. 120.  Public respondents nevertheless pray for the
denial of the petition not only because petitioners and intervenors failed to
exhaust administrative remedies and that their claims are barred by laches, but
also in view of the disruption of the present organizational set-up if
reinstatement <span style="">is </span>directed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General argues that while petitioners and
intervenors (except petitioners Samuel Hipol, Jane Corros and Efren Fontanilla)
were dismissed contemporaneously with their colleagues in <b><span style="">Mandani </span></b>(filed 3 June 1987 and
decided 4 June 1990), <b><span style="">Abrogar </span></b>(filed
31 October 1990 and decided 6 August 1991) and <b><span style="">Arnaldo </span></b>(filed 7 January 1991 and decided 6 August 1991),
they filed this petition and the interventions only in October 1991, and
February, March, May and July 1992, or more than four (4) years later, hence,
laches has set in.  In reply,
petitioners and intervenors explain -</p>

<blockquote>x x x since the time these DOT employees were illegally dismissed
in May, 1987, most of them returned to the far away provinces of their origin
because they became jobless.  It was
only by the slow and unreliable communication of word of mouth that they came
to know much later on that they are (sic) entitled to be reinstated to the DOT
x x x x<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of laches is "principally a question of inequity
of permitting a claim to be enforced, this inequity being founded on some
change in x x x<b> </b>the relation of parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> In
the case at bar, equity, if ever invoked, must lean in favor of petitioners and
intervenors who were unjustly injured by public respondents' unlawful
acts.  The prejudice from the
high-handed violation of the rights of petitioners and intervenors resulting in
their loss of employment is far more serious than the inconvenience to public
respondents in rectifying their own mistakes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioners and intervenors cannot be deemed to have
slept on their rights considering, as we should, the following <u>unrebutted</u>
allegations in the main petition:</p>

<blockquote>7.  Petitioners protested their illegal
termination from the DOT.  Many of them
questioned their termination with the Department of Labor and Employment where
they filed a Complaint against the DOT and its top officials for illegal
dismissal x x x x Some of them questioned their illegal termination before the
Civil Service Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.  Many of petitioners joined a picket and
demonstration held by illegally terminated employees of the DOT before its
office at the DOT building at the Luneta Park.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.  Petitioners were forced to receive their
separation or retirement benefits from the DOT, but all under protest.  The others continued to fight their cases
with the Department of Labor and Employment even if they got their separation
and/or retirement benefits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>11.  After the finality of this Decision
(Mandani) x x x x many other terminated employees of the DOT wrote to then DOT
Secretary Peter D. Garrucho, Jr., as the successor-in-interest of former Sec.
Jose U. Gonzalez, and DBM Secretary Guillermo Carague, asking that following
the Decision in this <u>Mandani vs. Gonzalez</u> case and being similarly
situated as the twenty-eight (28) petitioners therein, that they be reinstated
to their former or equivalent positions in the DOT and/or to be paid their back
wages.  Then x x x DOT Secretary
Garrucho and DBM Sec. Carague never responded to these letters and did not
reinstate and/or pay any of their back wages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>16.  Following the Decision of this Honorable
Court in the <u>Mandani vs. Gonzalez</u> case and its Resolution in the
consolidated cases of <u>Abrogar vs. Garrucho</u> and <u>Arnaldo vs. Garrucho</u>,

their back wages <span style="">x x x </span>x<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither could petitioners and intervenors be faulted for not
joining in the previous petitions because, as we held in <b>Cristobal v.
Melchor </b>(No. L-<span style="">43203, 29 July 1977;
78 SCRA </span><span style="">175, 183, 187) -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>More importantly, Cristobal could be expected- without necessarily
spending time and money by going to court - to relie upon the outcome of the
case filed by his co-employees to protect his interests considering the
similarity of his situation to that of the plaintiffs therein and the identical
relief being sought.  On this point, We
find a statement of Justice Louis Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court
in <i><span style="">Southern Pacific vs. Bogert,</span></i><span style=""> </span>relevant and persuasive, and We quote:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The essence of laches is not merely lapse of time.  It is essential that there be also

pursuit of a remedy * * * * <u>Where the cause of action is of such a nature

deemed thereafter free from the laches which bars those who sleep on their
rights</u> (citations omitted).</p>

Corbet v. Johnson, I Brock, 77, 81 - both cited in Hefner, et al. vs.
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., 123 U.S., 309, 313)."</i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><i>We emphasize that prescription was never raised here as an
issue; at most, it is deemed waived.  In
Fernandez v. Grolier International, Inc.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><i>
we stated:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote><i>In the case of Director of Lands v. Dano (96 SCRA 161, 165),
this Court held that 'inasmuch as petitioner had never pleaded the statute of
limitations, he is deemed to have waived the same.'<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="">In the cited case of </span></i><span style="">Director of Lands v. Dano, <i>the Director of
Lands, who was similarly situated as</i> </span>public respondents herein who
represent the Government, was deemed to have waived the defense of prescription
"inasmuch as petitioner had never pleaded the statute of
limitations."</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of prescription, we reiterate, may not be considered
at this late stage, not only because it was never raised and therefore now
foreclosed, but more importantly, because it must yield to the higher interest
of justice.  Incidentally, it is only in
the dissent that the question of prescription is introduced.  Not even the Government raised it.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1977, we in fact relaxed the rule on prescription in <b>Cristobal
v. Melchor</b><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><b>
</b>to give way to a determination of the case on the merits where, like in
this case, "[i]t was an act of the government through its responsible
officials <span style="">x x x<b> </b></span>which
contributed to the alleged delay in the filing of <span style="">x x x </span>complaint for reinstatement." But, we need not go
back that far.  On 15 August 1991, the
Court <i><span style="">En Banc </span></i>granted the
related petition in intervention of Alberto A. Peralta, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
in the consolidated cases of <b>Abrogar v. Garrucho, </b>and <b>Arnaldo </b><b><span style="">v. </span>Garrucho, </b>even if filed on 1
August 1991 or two months after the four-year prescriptive period, which lapsed
on the 14th and 2<span style="">8th </span>of May
1991.  As we ruled in <b>Cristobal v.
Melchor,</b><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
"it is indeed the better rule that courts, under the principle of equity,
will not be guided or bound strictly by the statute of limitations or the
doctrine of laches when to do so <i><span style="">manifest
wrong and </span>injustice </i><i><span style="">would
result."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The principle that prescription does not run against the State,
which contemplates a situation where a private party cannot defeat the claim of
the State by raising the defense of prescription, is inapplicable because in
this case the private parties are the ones filing a suit against the
State.  Consequently, we reiterate our
pronouncement in <b><span style="">Fernandez v.
Grolier International, Inc.,</span></b><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that "[i]t is true that there
are exceptions to the rule that an action will not be declared to have
prescribed if prescription is not expressly invoked <i><span style="">(Garcia vs. </span>Mathis, </i>100 SCRA 250).  However, where considerations of substantial justice come in (as
in this case when the very employment, and therefore the lifeblood, of each
petitioner/intervenor is involved), it is better to resolve the issues on the
basic merits of the case instead of applying the rule on prescription which the
private respondent waived when it was not pleaded." Anyhow, it was public
respondents who created the problem of petitioners and <span style="">intervenors by illegally abolishing their positions and terminating
their services in outrageous disregard of the basic protection accorded civil
servants, hence our repeated pronouncement that it was unconstitutional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it
imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in
legal contemplation, inoperative, as if it had not been passed.  It is therefore stricken from the statute
books and considered never to have existed at all.  Not only the parties but all persons are bound by the declaration
of unconstitutionality which means that no one may thereafter invoke it nor may
the courts be permitted to apply it in subsequent cases.  It is, in other words, a total nullity.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Plainly, it was as if petitioners and intervenors were never served their
termination orders and, consequently, were never separated from the
service.  The fact that they were not
able to assume office and exercise their duties is attributable to the
continuing refusal of public respondents to take them in unless they first
obtained court orders, perhaps, for government budgetary and accounting
purposes.  <span style="">Under the circumstances, </span>the more prudent thing that public
respondents could have done upon receipt of the decision in <b><span style="">Mandani, </span></b>if they were earnest in
making amends and restoring petitioners and intervenors to their positions, was
to inform the latter of the nullification of their termination orders and to
return to work and resume their functions.  After all, many of them were supposed to be waiting for instructions
from the DOT because in their termination orders it promised to directly
contact them by telephone, telegram or written notice as soon as funds for
their separation would be available.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the representations to DOT made by petitioners and
intervenors for their reinstatement partook of the nature of an administrative
proceeding, and public respondents also failed to raise the issue of
prescription therein.  As already
adverted to, that issue was never raised before us.  In reciting the alleged instances of delay in bringing up this
suit, the Solicitor General simply referred to laches, not prescription.  Since this case is an original action, and
if we treat the petition and interventions as ordinary complaints, the failure
of public respondents to raise the issue of prescription in their comments
cannot be interpreted any less than a waiver of that defense.  For, defenses and objections not pleaded
either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived, except the
failure to state a cause <span style="">of action
which may be alleged in a later pleading, if one is permitted.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Above all, what public respondents brought up was the doctrine of
laches, not prescription; and laches is different from prescription.  The defense of laches applies independently
of prescription.  While prescription is
concerned with the fact of delay, laches is concerned with the effect of
delay.  Prescription is a matter of
time; laches is a question of inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced,
this inequity being founded on some change in the condition of the property or
the relation of the parties.  Prescription is statutory; laches is not.  Laches applies in equity, whereas prescription applies at
law.  Prescription is based on fixed
time, laches is not.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> In
any case, it can be said that the prescriptive period was tolled with the
filing of the termination cases before the Department of Labor and Employment
and the Civil Service Commission, the pendency of which is acknowledged in the
Comment and Memorandum of public respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, even the picketing of the premises and the placards
demanding their immediate reinstatement could not be any less than written
demands sufficient to interrupt the period of prescription.  As we noted earlier, "[a]fter the
finality of this Decision (Mandani) x x x x many other terminated employees of
the DOT wrote to then DOT Secretary Peter D. Garrucho, Jr. x x x x and DBM
Secretary Guillermo Carague asking that following the Decision in this <u>Mandani
vs. Gonzales</u> case and being similarly situated as the twenty-eight (28)
petitioners therein x x x they be reinstated to their former or equivalent
positions in the DOT and/or to be paid their back wages." But "[t]hen
x x x DOT Secretary Garrucho and DBM Sec. Carague never responded to these
letters,"<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
so that it may be said that the period that was interrupted never started to
run again against petitioners and intervenors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirement of prior resort to administrative remedies is not
an absolute rule and this did not bar direct access to this Court in the
analogous cases <span style="">of </span><b>Dario v.
Mison</b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>

<span style="">thus -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The Court disregards the questions raised as to procedure, failure
to exhaust administrative remedies, the standing of certain parties to sue
(this was raised by the Civil Service Commission in G.R. No. 86241, and failure
to exhaust administrative remedies was raised in G.R. Nos. 81954 and 81917 by
the Solicitor General), and other technical objections, for two reasons,
"(b]ecause of the demands of public interest, including the need for
stability in the public service" (Sarmiento III v. Mison, G.R. No. 79974,
December 17, 1987, 153 SCRA 549, 551-552) and because of the serious
implications of these cases on the administration of the Philippine civil
service and the rights of public servants.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the argument that existing organizational set­up would be
disrupted if reinstatement be directed, we need only reiterate our 18 October
1990 Resolution in <b>Mandani </b>that -</p>

<blockquote>An erring head of a Department, Bureau, or Office cannot avoid
reinstatement, payment of back pay, and other acts of compliance with the
orders of this Court by interposing changes effected subsequent to his unlawful
acts and claiming that such changes make it difficult to obey this Court's
orders.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The basic principle to be applied whenever the Court declares an
administrative official to have acted in an unlawful manner is for that
official to undo the harmful effects of his illegal act and to accord to the
aggrieved parties restoration or restitution in good faith to make up for the
deprivations which may have been suffered because of his act.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners and intervenors, who are similarly situated as their
counterparts in <b>Mandani, Abrogar </b>and <b>Arnaldo, </b>deserve no less
than equal treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General takes exception to petitioner Samuel Hipol
who was separated from the service under an order of 19 May 1986 issued
pursuant to Sec. 2, Art. III, of Proclamation No. 3, and not under E. O. No.
120.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
In reply, petitioner Hipol admits that he was "in the process of working

as in the same situation as the petitioners in <b><span style="">Mandani, Abrogar </span></b>and <b><span style="">Arnaldo.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">A parallel case is that of intervenor Concepcion Timario who,
according to the Solicitor General, resigned effective 28 May 1987 and was not
separated under any of the invalid orders.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Intervenor Timario however contends that she is entitled to relief because her
courtesy resignation was accepted on 9 June 1987 or during the period positions
were declared vacant pursuant to MOT Office Order No. 9-87.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
It is significant to note that Timario's letter of resignation cited
"professional reasons" <span style="">as </span>cause
for her abdication<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
which, obviously, pertains to the nature of her work.  Moreover, conspicuously absent is the customary order requiring
the filing of courtesy resignations.  Timario may not be permitted to characterize, by way of self-serving
assertions, that her resignation was merely a courtesy resignation pursuant to
any of the voided office orders or memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the Solicitor General that petitioners Jane Corros
and Efren Fontanilla were not employees of the Ministry of Tourism because
their names did not appear in the regular plantilla of the Ministry of Tourism,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
is specious since the listing of names in the plantilla is not a conclusive
evidence of employment.  Nonetheless, in
view of the incessant allegation of the Solicitor General that Corros and
Fontanilla were not employees of the Ministry, and considering the photocopies
of Fontanilla's appointment papers and termination order submitted by him,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as the bare assertion of petitioner Corros that she was for 11 years
PRO I in the Licensing Division of the Ministry and that her name could not be
found in the plantilla because she is now Jane Ombawa in view of her marriage,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
the fact of employment should be threshed out first in a proper forum as this
Court is not a trier of facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General contends that since petitioner Myrna
Salvador was a casual employee,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
intervenor Ascension Padilla was a temporary appointee whose appointment
expired 20 February 1987,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a> and
intervenor Evelyn Enriquez was also a temporary appointee,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
their appointments are terminable at the pleasure of the appointing
authority.  Considering however that the
office orders and memoranda which directed the separation of petitioners and
intervenors were annulled, hence in legal contemplation did not exist, the
effect is, as if the terminations did not occur.  However, since the determination in this case is limited only to
the extent of the nullity of said orders and memoranda, the reinstatement of
Salvador, Padilla and Enriquez cannot be ordered in the instant proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General also seeks dismissal of the petition and
intervention against intervenors Rizalina T. Espiritu, Abdulia T. Landingin,
Medardo Ilao, Rosita Somera, Armando Cruz, Catalino Dabu, Francisco Villaraiz,
Norma Jumilla, Kennedy Basa, Rolando G. Cagasca and Alfonso Angeles because
they were already reinstated.  However,
because of the unrefuted allegation that these employees were not yet paid
their respective back wages, then to that extent, their petitions must be
granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In computing back wages, we cannot blindly accept the allegation
of petitioners and intervenors that since their separation from the service in
1987, or about seven (7) years ago, they have been jobless hence entitled to
full back wages.  Conformably with existing
jurisprudence, the award of back wages should not exceed a period of five (5)
years.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the final analysis, the dissent admits that petitioners and
intervenors truly deserve the reliefs they pray for except that their cause of
action has allegedly prescribed.  Shall
we now frustrate their rightful claims on a ground that was never raised, nor
even hinted at, by public respondents in the entire proceeding? That would be
antithetic to our concept of social justice; at the very least, it is
subversive of the rudiments of fairplay.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is GRANTED.  Petitioners Violeta Aldovino, Ali Alibasa,

reason of their termination shall be reimbursed through reasonable salary deductions.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I fully agree with the majority opinion that the separation from the
service of petitioners and intervenors (save petitioners Samuel Hipol, Jane
Corros, and Efren Fontanilla) was made pursuant to the office orders and
memoranda declared void in <i><span style="">Mandani
vs. Gonzales</span></i><span style=""> </span>(186
SCRA 108 [1990]).  <span style="">Said case and the subsequent consolidated
cases of </span><i><span style="">Abrogar vs.
Garrucho, Jr</span></i><span style="">. </span><span style="">and </span><i><span style="">Arnaldo vs. Garrucho, Jr.</span></i><span style=""> (G.R. </span><span style="">Nos. 95773 and
96533, 6 August 1991) </span>would have necessarily benefited petitioners and
intervenors and made their reinstatement inevitable were it not for their
failure to bring the action within the prescriptive period.  It is on this point that I am constrained to
disagree with the majority opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">I gather from the majority opinion that, as admitted by
petitioners and intervenors, the illegal dismissal took place in May 1987.  This petition was filed only in October
1991.  The interventions were filed in
February, April, May, and July, 1992 <span style="">(<i>Ponencia</i>,
5, </span><span style="">last paragraph) </span>or
more than four years after the cause of action had accrued.  The petitions in <i><span style="">Mandani, Abrogar</span></i><span style="">, </span>and
<i><span style="">Arnaldo</span></i><span style=""> were </span>filed on 3 June 1987, 31 October
1990, and 7 <span style="">January 1991, respectively,
or all before the expiration of the four-year period.  An illegal dismissal is an injury to a person's rights.  Accordingly, pursuant to Article 1146 of the
Civil Code, an action for reinstatement and back salaries must be filed within
four years from the accrual of the cause of action or from the illegal
dismissal.  Since the instant petition
and the interventions were filed long after the lapse of the four-year period,
this Court is left with no other choice except to dismiss this case.  The Office of the Solicitor General is
correct on this point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another obstacle to this
petition is that it is for </span><i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span>(Petition, 2) <span style="">which must be filed within one year after dismissal.  In </span><i>Madrigal vs. Lecaroz</i> (191
SCRA 20, 25-26 [1990]), <span style="">this Court,
through Mr. Justice Leo Medialdea, held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The unbending jurisprudence in this jurisdiction is to the
effect that a petition for <i><span style="">quo
warranto </span></i>and <i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span>affecting titles to public office must
be filed within one (1) year from the date the petitioner is ousted from his
position (Galano, et al. v. Roxas, G.R. No. L-31241, September 12, 1975, 67
SCRA 8; Cornejo v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. L-32818, June 28, 1974, 57
SCRA 663; Sison v. Pangramuyen, etc. et al., G.R. No. L-40295, July 31, 1978,
84 SCRA 364; Cui v. Cui, G.R. No. L-18727, August 31, 1964, 11 SCRA 755;
Villaluz v. Zaldivar, G.R. No. L-22754, December 31, 1965, 15 SCRA 710;
Villegas v. De la Cruz, G.R. No. L­-23752, December 31, 1965, 15 SCRA 720; De
la Maza v. Ochave, G.R. No. L-22336, May 23, 1967, 20 SCRA 142; Alejo v.
Marquez, G.R. No. L-29053, February 27, 1971, 37 SCRA 762).  The reason behind this ruling was expounded
in the case of Unabia v. City Mayor, etc., 99 Phil. 253 where <span style="">We </span>said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x x [W]e note that in actions of quo warranto<span style=""> </span><span style="">involving
right to an office, the action must be instituted within the period of one
year.  This has been the law in the
island since 1901, the period having been originally fixed in Section 216 of
the Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190).  We find this provision to be an expression of policy on the part of the
State that persons claiming a right to an office of which they are illegally
dispossessed should immediately take steps to recover said office and that if
they do not do </span>so within a period of one year, they shall be considered
as having lost their right thereto by abandonment.  There are weighty reasons of public policy and convenience that
demand the adoption of a similar period for persons claiming rights to
positions in the civil service.  There
must be stability in the service so that public business may (sic) be unduly
retarded; delays in the statement of the right to positions in the service must
be discouraged.  The following considerations
as to public officers, by Mr. Justice Bengzon, may well be applicable to
employees in the civil service:</p>

<p class="3Q">"Furthermore, constitutional rights may certainly be waived,
and the inaction of the officer for one year could be validly considered as waiver,
i.e., a renunciation which no principle of justice may prevent, he being at
liberty to resign his position anytime he pleases.</p>

<p class="3Q">And there is good justification for the limitation period; it is
not proper that the title to public office should be subjected to continued
uncertainly (sic), and the peoples' interest requires that such right should be
determined as speedily as practicable." (Tumulak vs. Egay, 46 Off. Gaz.,
[8], 3693, 3695.)</p>

<p class="2Q">Further, the Government must be immediately informed or advised if any
person claims to be entitled to an office or a position in the civil service as
against another actually holding it, so that the Government may not be faced
with the predicament of having to pay two salaries, one, for the person
actually holding the office, although illegally, and another, for one not
actually rendering service although entitled to do so.  We hold that in view of the policy of the
State contained in the law fixing the period of one year within which actions
for quo warranto may be instituted, any person claiming right to a position in
the civil service should also be required to file his petition for
reinstatement within the period of one year, otherwise he is thereby considered
as having abandoned his office.'"</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The principle of equity which
the majority opinion invokes is inapplicable.  Equity is available only in the absence of positive law.  As beautifully expressed by this Court
through Mr. Justice Isagani A. Cruz in </span><i><span style="">Aguila vs. </span>Court of First Instance of </i><i><span style="">Batangas</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">(160 SCRA 352, 359-360
[1988]):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For all its conceded merits, equity is available only in the
absence of law and not as its replacement.  Equity is described as justice outside legality, which simply means that
it cannot supplant although it may, as often happens, supplement the law.  We said it in an earlier case <span style="">[<i>Zabat Jr. vs. </i></span><i>CA,</i> 142
SCRA 587], and we repeat it now, that all abstract arguments based only on
equity should yield to positive rules, which pre­empt and prevail over such
persuasions.  Emotional appeals for
justice, while they may wring the heart of the Court, cannot justify disregard
of the mandate of the law as long as it remains in force.  The applicable maxim, which goes back to the
ancient days of the Roman jurists -- and is now still reverently observed <span style="">-? is <i>aequetas </i></span><i><span style="">nunquam contravenit </span></i><i><span style="">legis</span></i><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In my view, petitioners
and intervenors only desire to take advantage of our rulings in <i>Mandani,
Abrogar</i>, and <i>Arnaldo</i>.  Initially, they had no interest, or had lost any, in seeking judicial
remedy after their dismissal.  They
really did not care much about their separation from the service.  Otherwise, they would not have wasted
precious time waiting for a herald to bring them good tidings.  In short, they chose to sleep on their
rights.  The laws aid those who are
vigilant, not those who sleep upon their rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To meet the above
disquisition, the modified majority opinion now claims that since the defense
of prescription was never raised by the respondents, it is deemed waived; and
that the following unrebutted allegations in the main petition bring them
within our ruling in <i>Cristobal vs. Melchor</i> </span>(78 SCRA 175 [1977]):</p>

<blockquote>"7.
Petitioners protested their illegal termination from the DOT.  Many of them questioned their termination
with the Department of Labor and Employment where they filed a Complaint
against the DOT and its top officials for illegal dismissal <span style="">x x </span>x Some of them questioned their
illegal termination before the Civil Service Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  8. <span style="">Many
</span>of petitioners joined a picket and demonstration held by illegally terminated
employees of the DOT before its office at the DOT building at the Luneta Park.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  9.  Petitioners were forced to receive their separation or retirement
benefits from the DOT, but all under protest.  The others continued to fight their cases with the Department of Labor
and Employment even if they got their separation and/or retirement benefits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>11. After the
finality of this Decision (Mandani) x x x many other terminated employees of
the DOT wrote to then DOT Secretary Peter D. Garrucho, Jr., as the
successor-in-interest of former Sec. Jose U. Gonzalez, and DBM Secretary
Guillermo Carague, asking that following the Decision in this <u>Mandani</u> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Gonzalez</u> case and being similarly situated as the twenty-eight (28)
petitioners therein, that they be reinstated to their former or equivalent
positions in the DOT and/or to be paid their back wages.  Then x x x DOT Secretary Garrucho and DBM
Sec. Carague never responded to these letters and did not reinstate and/or pay

<p class="BODY">While <span style="">it may be true that
the public respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General, did not
raise the defense of prescription, it cannot be denied that the allegations in
the petition clearly show that the petitioners' cause of action has indeed
prescribed.  </span><span style="">In </span><i><span style="">Gulang vs. Nadayag</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">(214 SCRA </span>355, 362<span style="">-</span>363 [1992], citing <i><span style="">Philippine </span></i><i><span style="">National </span></i><i><span style="">Bank </span></i><i><span style="">vs. Pacific
Commission House</span></i><span style=""> </span>(27
SCRA 766 [1969]; <i><span style="">Garcia vs. </span></i><i><span style="">Mathis</span></i><span style=""> </span>(100 SCRA 250 [1980]; and <i>Aznar </i><i><span style="">III vs. Bernad </span></i>(161 SCRA 276
[1988]), <span style="">we held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is also authority to the effect that the defense of
prescription is not deemed waived, even if not pleaded in a motion to dismiss
or in the answer, if plaintiff's allegation in the complaint or the evidence he
presents shows clearly that the action has prescribed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><i>Cristobal vs. Melchor</i> <span style="">has </span><span style="">a very peculiar
factual backdrop which justified an exception to the general rule.  In the said case, this Court found the
following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"2.  It was an act of the government through its
responsible officials more particularly then Executive Secretary Amelito Mutuc
and his successors which contributed to the alleged delay in the filing of
Cristobal's present complaint for reinstatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence of Cristobal establish the following:   After the <i><span style="">Ingles </span>suit </i>was filed in court, the dismissed employees,
Cristobal included, continued to seek reconsideration of their dismissal.  It was then that Executive Secretary Mutuc
assured the employees that without prejudice to the continuation of the civil
action, he would work for their reinstatement.  Accordingly, some of the dismissed employees were recalled to their
respective positions in the Office of the President among whom were the
plaintiffs in the civil case and several others who were not parties
therein.  Secretary Mutuc even tried to
place the others outside of the Malacañang Office.  An affidavit of Emiliano Punzal, retired Presidential Records
Officer, attests to the fact that Jose C. Cristobal 'was among those in the
list of separated employees ordered for placement to a position commensurate to
his qualification and experience.' In the meantime, however, Secretary Mutuc
was replaced by other Executive Secretaries to whom Cristobal over and over
again presented his request for reinstatement and who gave the same assurance
that Cristobal would be recalled and re-employed at 'the opportune time'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was this continued promise of the government officials concerned
which led Cristobal to bide his time and wait for the Office of the President
to comply with its commitment.  Furthermore, he had behind him the decision of the Supreme Court in <i><span style="">Ingles vs. Mutuc</span></i><span style=""> </span>which he believed should be applied in
his favor.  But when Cristobal, in
answer to his various letters, received the letter of May 19, 1971 from the
Office of the President denying his reinstatement and declaring the matter
'definitely closed' because of his failure to file an action in court within
one year from his separation, it was only then that he saw the necessity of
seeking redress from the courts."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the petitioners, as shown in the aforequoted
paragraphs in their main petition, explicitly admit that they protested their
illegal termination from the DOT; many of them questioned their termination
with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE); and some of them questioned
such illegal termination before the Civil Service Commission (CSC).  Considering that they ultimately took this
recourse after four years, it would be safe to presume that the decisions of
the DOLE and the CSC were adverse to them; they took no further action thereon,
and allowed the decisions to become final.  The petitioners then should not be permitted to belatedly re-litigate
the matter by way of <i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WHEREFORE, I </span>vote <span style="">to </span><span style="">DENY </span><span style="">the </span>petition <span style="">for </span>want of merit.</p>
