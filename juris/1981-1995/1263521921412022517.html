A Petition for Review of the Order of the then Court of First Instance 
of Negros Oriental, Branch V, dismissing petitioners' Complaint for 
reconveyance with damages, in Civil Case No. 5094, for lack of cause of 
action due to petitioners' failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
<p>
In his lifetime, Celestino Lantao possessed a parcel of unregistered 
land with a nipa swamp containing an area of approximately 2944 sq. ms. 
situated at Caranoche, Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental, known as Lot No. 
73, Pls 790-D.  Celestino is the common predecessor-in-interest of the 
parties.  Petitioners brother and sister are the children of his 
deceased daughter Mauricia, while private respondent is his son.  
Celestino died shortly before the 2nd World War.
</p><p>
According to petitioners' Complaint, since their grand­father's death, 
they possessed the western portion of subject property, while private 
respondent occupied the eastern part; that they had been paying taxes on
 their portion and enjoying the fruits thereof; that sometime in 1968 
they and private respondent went to the Bureau of Lands to have their 
respective properties titled but they discovered that the area possessed
 and cultivated by private respondent was inadvertently included in 
petitioners' Tax Declaration No. 4116; that in view of this discrepancy,
 they decided to partition the lot into two; that on December 24, 1968, 
petitioner Patrocinia executed a Deed of Quitclaim whereby she "quit my 
claim over one-half (½) of said parcel of land x x x in favor of my 
uncle Zoilo Lantao", and likewise "quit my claim over one-fourth (¼) 
share of said parcel of land x x x in favor of my brother Emilio 
Obañana"; that they also agreed to exchange the portions they 
respectively possessed such that private respondent would take his 
one-half (½) share from the western portion while plaintiffs would take 
their share from the eastern portion; that this agreement was 
graphically indicated in the sketch appearing in the document signed by 
Patrocinia and approved by private respondent Zoilo Lantao, and by 
petitioner Emilio; that thereafter petitioners went to their lot to 
harvest the nipa palms on the eastern portion but to their surprise, 
they were stopped by private respondent who threatened them with bodily 
harm and the filing of criminal cases; that they subsequently discovered
 that private respondent, without their knowledge and consent, had 
surreptitiously and fraudulently applied for a homestead patent over the
 whole lot in utter disregard of their rights and ultimately obtained 
Original Certificate of Title No. FV-9121 on July 18, 1969, also through
 fraud and misrepresentation; that they were thus compelled to institute
 on June 25, 1970 the Complaint below for reconveyance of the eastern 
portion premised on breach of constructive trust by private respondent.
</p><p>
Private respondent answered the Complaint alleging that subject property
 is his share in his father's estate; that petitioners had been given 
their share through their deceased mother; and that he had not given his
 approval to the Deed of Quitclaim.
</p><p>
Subsequently, upon private respondent's motion, on the grounds that the 
award of a patent by the Director of Lands is conclusive upon the rights
 of the parties and that it is said official, not the Trial Court, who 
has jurisdic­tion over the controversy; and that there can be no 
collate­ral attack on private respondent's title, respondent Judge 
dismissed the Complaint for lack of cause of action due to petitioners' 
failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  Said the Court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In the exercise of his authority, the Director of Lands passes 
upon the qualification of an applicant for a land grant.  This authority
 is exclusively lodged with the said official.  To order the 
reconveyance of a portion of a parcel of land subject of this litigation
 would be tantamount to this Court arrogating unto itself a power not 
granted to it.  Worthy of note is the absence of a declaration from the 
said official that the plain­tiffs herein are qualified to acquire 
public agricultural lands under the Public Land Act as amended. </p>
  <p> Likewise, the granting of the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs in 
their complaint will result in setting aside a decision of an 
administrative official without giving him an opportunity to correct 
whatever error he may have committed.  Surely the actuation of the 
plaintiffs is not what is intended by the law.  However, under the 
present state of facts, they are not left without a remedy because the 
subject certificate of title may still be set aside, but at the instance
 or with the conformity of the Director of Lands, pursuant to Section 91
 of the Public Land Act, as amended."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As petitioners had failed to obtain reconsideration, this Petition was filed.
</p><p>
We reverse.  The doctrine requiring prior exhaustion of administrative 
remedies before recourse to Courts may be had is confined to public 
lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  It is inapplicable 
to private lands.  A free patent application having been granted in the 
case at bar and a corresponding certificate of title having been issued,
 subject property ceased to be part of the public domain and became 
private property over which the Director of Lands has neither control 
nor jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  The land
 covered thereby assumes the character of registered property in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 122 of the Land Registration 
Act and the remedy of the party who has been injured by fraudulent 
registration is an action for reconveyance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  The relief that petitioners seek is the enforcement of a constructive 
trust in order to obtain a judgment for reconveyance of the land, 
relying on Article 1456 of the Civil Code, which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person 
obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied 
trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes."
  </p>
  <p>
  Clearly then, petitioners' cause of action is incapable of administrative resolution.
  </p>
  <p> "Furthermore, should defendant-appellant succeed at the trial in 
establishing the fraud and breach of trust on the part of plaintiff as 
his alleged former tenant who allegedly maliciously and in bad faith 
took undue advantage as defendant's tenant on the land to grab the same 
from defendant the recent decision of this Court in <em>Miguel vs. Court of Appeals, et a</em>l.
 would entitle defendant, on the principle of enforcement of a 
constructive trust, to obtain in the case below a judgment for the 
reconveyance of the land notwithstanding that the Director of Lands and 
the Register of Deeds have not been made parties to the case.  In the 
said case of Miguel <em>vs.</em> Court of Appeals, this Court held that 
where the respondent in breach of fiduciary duty and through fraud 
succeeded in obtaining a sales patent and ultimately an original 
certificate of title over a parcel of land which was openly and 
continuously possessed by petitioner in the concept of owner, the 
respondent could be judicially compelled to reconvey or assign to 
petitioner the land thus unlawfully and in breach of trust titled by the
 respondent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered REVERSING and SETTING ASIDE 
respondent Judge's Order of July 13, 1979 dismissing the complaint, and 
the Order, dated August 10, 1979, denying reconsideration, and REMANDING
 this case for further proceedings to the Regional Trial Court 
correspond­ing to the former Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental,
 Branch V.  No costs.
SO ORDERED.
