				<H3>SERVANDO’S INCORPORATED, PETITIONER, VS. THE
SECRETARY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT AND THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR, REGION VI,
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a motion filed by the respondents seeking reconsideration
of the 26 April 1990 decision of the Court, which ordered the referral to <span style="">the </span>appropriate Labor Arbiter of the
case earlier decided by the respondents, as said case was declared to be within
the <u>exclusive</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> of the Labor Arbiter, since the
aggregate claims of each of the fifty four (54) employees involved exceed the
amount of P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents invoke the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement power of the Secretary of Labor
under Art. 128(b) of the Labor Code</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style=""> which, according to them, is entirely
separate and distinct from the Regional Director’s power to adjudicate simple
money claims under Art. 129 of the same Code; and that Art. 217 (a) (6) of the
Labor Code granting original and exclusive jurisdiction to Labor Arbiters over
all money claims arising from employer-employee relations involving an amount <span style="">exceeding </span>P5,000.00, whether or not
accompanied with </span>a <span style="">claim f</span><span style="">or </span><span style="">reinstatement, should not be interpreted as
an amendment to Art. 128 (b), i.e. as providing an additional exception to the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement power of the Secretary of Labor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are actually three (3) provisions of the Labor Code that
are determinative of the instant issue of <span style="">jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 217 (a) (6) which provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Art. 217. Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the Commission.-(a)
Except as otherwise provided under this Code, the Labor Arbiters shall have
original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide, within thirty (30)
calendar days after the submission of the case by the parties for decision
without extension, even in the absence of stenographic notes, the following
cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(6) Except claims

of persons <span style="">in </span>domestic or
household service, <u>involving an amount exceeding Five thousand pesos
(P5,000.00), whether or not accompanied<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 129 which provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Art. 129. Recovery of wages, simple money claims and other
benefits. - Upon complaint of any interested party, the Regional Director of
the Department of Labor and Employment or any of the duly authorized hearing
officers of the Department <span style="">is </span>empowered,
through summary proceeding and after due notice, to hear and decide any matter
invol­ving the recovery of wages and other monetary claims and benefits,
including legal interest, owing to an employee or person employed in domestic
or household service or <span class="SpellE">househelper</span> under this Code,
arising from employer-employee relations:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Provided, That such complaint does not include a claim for
reinstatement:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>further, That the aggregate money claims of
each employee or <span class="SpellE">househelper</span> do not exceed Five<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thousand pesos (P5,000.00</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.” (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article 128(b) which provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Art. 128(b) The provisions of Article 217 of this Code to the
contrary notwithstanding and in cases where the relationship <span style="">of </span>employer-employee s<span style="">till exists, </span>the <u>Minister of Labor
and Employment or his duly authorized representatives shall have the power to
order and administer</u>, after due notice and hearing, <u>compliance with the
labor standards provisions of this Code and other labor legislation</u> based
on the findings of labor regulation officers or industrial safety engineers
made in the course of inspection, and to issue writs of execution to the
appropriate authority for the enforcement of their orders, <u>except in cases
where the employer contests the findings of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the labor regulation officer and raises issues which cannot be resolved
without considering evidentiary matters that are not verifiable in the normal
course of inspection</u>.” (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A careful consideration of the above-quoted three (3) provisions
of the Labor Code leads the Court to reiterate its ruling that the <u>exclusive</u>
jurisdiction to hear and decide employees’ claims arising from
employer-employee relations, exceeding the aggregate amount of P5,000.00 for
each employee, is vested in the Labor Arbiter (Article 217 <span style="">(a) </span><span style="">(6)).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>exclusive</u>
jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">confirmed by the
provisions of Article 129 which <u>excludes</u> from the jurisdiction of the
Regional Director or any hearing officer of the Department of Labor the power
to hear and decide claims of employees arising from employer-employee relations
exceeding the amount of P5,000.00 for each employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To construe the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> power of the
Secretary of Labor to order and enforce compliance with labor laws as including
the power to hear and decide cases involving employees’ claims for wages, <span style="">arising </span>from employer-employee
relations, <u>even</u> <u>if</u> the amount of said claims exceed <span style="">P5,000.00 for each employee, would, in our
considered opinion, emasculate and render meaningless, if not useless, the
provisions of Article 217 (a) (6) and Article 129 of </span>the <span style="">Labor Code which, as above-pointed out,
confer <u>exclusive</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>jurisdiction on
the Labor Arbiter to hear and decide such employees’ claims (exceeding
P5,000.00 for each employee).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>To
sustain the respondents’ position would, in effect, sanction a situation where
all employees’ claims, regardless of amount, can be heard and determined by the
Secretary of Labor under his <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This does not, however, appear to be the
legislative intent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We further hold that to <u>harmonize </u>the above-quoted three
(3) provisions of the Labor Code, the Secretary of Labor should be held as possessed
of his plenary <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> powers to order the
inspection of all establishments where labor is employed, to look into all
possible violations of labor laws and regulations but the power to hear and
decide employees’ claims exceeding P5,000.00 for each employee should be left
to the Labor Arbiter as the <u>exclusive</u> <u>repository</u> of the power to
hear and decide such claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">other words, the inspection conducted by the
Secretary of Labor, through labor regulation officers or industrial safety
engineers, may yield findings of violations of labor standards under labor
laws; the Secretary of Labor may order compliance with said labor standards, if
necessary, through appropriate writs of execution but when the findings dis­close
an employee claim of over P5,000.00, the matter should be referred to the Labor
Arbiter in recognition of his <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction over such claims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is this position devoid of sound reason or purpose, because -</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>1. The proceedings before
the Secretary of Labor (or his agents) exercising his <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span>
powers is <u>summary</u> <u>in</u> <u>nature</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, proceedings before the
Labor Arbiters are more formal and in accord with rules of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the employee’s claim is less than
P5,000.00, a summary procedure for its settlement can be justified, but not
when <span style="">a </span>claim is more or less
substantial, from the standpoint of both employee and management, for which
reason, an employee’s claim exceeding P5,000.00 is placed within the <u>exclusive</u>
jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter to hear and decide.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 129 of the Labor
Code expressly provides that “<u>upon</u> <u>complaint</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u>
<u>interested</u> <u>party</u>,” the Regional Director (and, consequently, the
Secretary of Labor to whom appeals from the Regional Director are taken) is
empowered to hear and decide simple money claims, i.e. those that do not exceed
P5,000.00 for each employee, employing for this purpose a summary
procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Article 128(b) of the
Labor Code were <span style="">to </span>be construed
as empowering the Secretary of Labor, under his <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span>
power, to hear and decide all types of employee’s claims, <u>including</u> <u>those</u>
<u>exceeding</u> <u>P5,000.00</u> <u>for</u> <u>each</u> <u>employee</u>,
employing for this purpose a summary procedure, then, Article 129 (limiting the
Regional Director’s jurisdiction to a claim <u>not</u> exceeding P5,000.00)
becomes a useless <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span> in the Labor Code.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it would seem
that as the law (Article 129) limits the jurisdiction of the Regional Director
(and, therefore, the Secretary of Labor on appeal from the Regional Director)
to “complaints of any interested party” seeking an amount of not more than
P5,000.00, for each employee, it cannot be that, because of the absence of any
complaint from any interested party, the Secretary of Labor under his <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> power, is <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> empowered to hear and decide employee’s
claim of more than P5,000.00 for each employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to all the foregoing, the Court cannot overlook the
fact that petitioner <u>contests</u> the findings of the labor regulation
officer, upon which, the respondents based their questioned orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can it be argued with persuasion that the
issues raised by petitioner are not evidentiary in nature and unverifiable in
the course of <span style="">inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the total amount of the
respondents’ award against petitioner, is P964,952.50 (with the award for each
of the fifty four (54) employees involved not being less than P5,000.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total award of P964,952.50 is a tidy sum
sufficient to knock-off any viable enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is worse is that all this is done through </span>summary <span style="">proceedings.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The elementary demands of <u>due</u> <u>process</u> upon which
the <u>express</u> <u>exception</u> to the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span>
powers of the Secretary<span style=""> </span><span style="">of Labor</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is obviously anchored, would require something
more than a summary disposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
petitioner states in his comment on respondents’ motion for reconsideration of
the Court’s decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>the
petitioner filed its Motion for Reconsideration on July 8, 1987, asking for an <span style="">opportunity </span>to present its payrolls
and records, considering that the computation arrived at by the Regional
Director is a straight computation that did not take into account the actual
number of days worked, the status of the employees, the absences incurred, the
advances obtained, the allowances given, among other factors.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The very fact that the petitioner has come before <span style="">the </span>Supreme Court <span style="">in </span>the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
clearly shows that it contests the findings of the Regional Director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, everything would have been, if the
stand of <span style="">the </span>Public Respondents
were to be believed, an exercise in futility.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lastly, it is undeniable that the issues involved here are matters
that (are) evidentiary in nature, involving as it does matters <span style="">that </span>cannot be resolved and are not
verifiable in the normal course of inspection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is only through a proper hearing before the Labor Arbiter
where it may be discovered which workers are entitled to the alleged wage
differentials, if any, and for how much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without this, the petitioner would not be able to prove the correctness
of the amounts given to the workers concerned after taking into account
extraneous factors <span style="">such as </span>absences,
attendance, advances and so on.”<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the motion for reconsideration is
DENIED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This denial is<span style=""> </span>final.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">NARVASA, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I regret to have to dissent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts which gave rise to the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>
at bar are fairly simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A routine
inspection of petitioner's establishment was conducted by officers of the Labor
Standards and Welfare Office, DOLE, resulting in the discovery of
"violations of labor standards/occupational health and safety
measures." The petitioner was apprised <span class="GramE">thereof,</span>
and subsequently required to present its payrolls and daily time records before
the Regional Director with the warning that its failure to do so would be
deemed a waiver of its right to present evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner ignored the warning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not present its records or any
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Regional Director then
issued an Order requiring the petitioner to pay 54 of its employees
"differentials in wages and allowances" in the aggregate amount of
P964,952.50, as well as to clear the passageway<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>of its warehouse of waste material and to install fire extinguishers in
accordance with "occupational safety and health rules." Petitioner
appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission, but the latter affirmed
the Regional Director's orders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner filed the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> at bar,
raising the sole issue of "whether or not they Regional Director has the
jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving recovery of wages and other
monetary claims and benefits of workers and employees." By judgment
promulgated on <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1990</st1:date>,
the Second Division granted the petition, declared the Regional Director to be
without jurisdiction over the case and directed that it be referred "to
the appropriate Labor Arbiter for proper determination." Petitioner filed
a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this
motion which the Court is now called upon to resolve.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may initially be pointed out, parenthetically, that the
referral thus decreed results in that splitting of jurisdiction which the law
seeks to avoid:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the Regional Director
retaining cognizance over the matter of the waste material and the installation
of fire extinguishers in the employer's premises, and the Labor Arbiter
assuming jurisdiction of the "differentials in wages and allowances"
in the total sum of P964,952.50 due the employees, in respect of which the
employer was deemed to have waived the right to present countervailing evidence
in the first place.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fundamental issue which this opinion addresses concerns the
interpretation of <i>Article 128</i> -- dealing with the <i>"<span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement power"</i> of the Regional
Directors as "authorized representatives" of the Secretary of Labor
-- in relation to:</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Article 129</i>, treating of the same Regional Directors' <i>adjudicative
or quasi-judicial authority</i>, i.e. - their power under certain conditions to
take cognizance of and adjudicate complaints involving the recovery of wages and
other monetary claims and benefits, including legal interest, owing to an
employee or person employed in domestic or household service; and</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Article 217</i>, defining the cases falling within the
exclusive original jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both Articles 217 and 129 -</p>

<p class="NUM">1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">deal</span>
with <i>jurisdiction</i>, in the sense of the authority to try and decide a
case, or hear and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>determine a cause;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2) refer <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> to complaints
involving the recovery of wages and other monetary claims and benefits, including
legal interest, owing to an employee or person employed in domestic or
household service or <span class="SpellE">househelper</span>; and</p>

<p class="NUM">3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">prescribe</span>
an appeal from the decision rendered under either provision to the National
Labor Relations Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is withal no concurrence, or overlapping of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the
Labor Arbiter over matters involving recovery of wages and other monetary
claims under Article 217 is limited to those cases involving an amount <i>exceeding
P5,000,</i> "regardless of whether accompanied with a claim for
reinstatement." On the other hand, the Regional Directors' jurisdiction
extends only to those cases for recovery of wages and other monetary claims and
benefits, where (a) the complaint does not include a claim for reinstatement,
and (b) the aggregate money claims of each employee or <span class="SpellE">househelper</span>
<i>do not exceed P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">The question that now arises is whether this limitation an the <i>adjudicatory
authority or jurisdiction</i> of the Regional Directors - - i.e., that the
money claim of each employee or householder should <i>not exceed P5,000.00</i>
-- also applies to and operates to limit as well the <span class="SpellE"><i>visitorial</i></span><i>
and enforcement power</i> of said Regional Directors described in Article 128.</p>

<p class="BODY">I submit that it does not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The matter has already been passed upon and squarely resolved by the
Court <i>en banc</i> in its decision rendered on February 7, 1990 in G.R. No.
74621 entitled <i>"<span class="SpellE">Brokenshire</span> Memorial
Hospital, Inc. v. Hon. Minister of Labor &amp; Employment et al."</i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
That judgment <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> adopted the view
expressed in the "Separate Opinion in the case of <span class="SpellE">Briad</span>
Agro Dev. Corp.,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
as reconsidered, a portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>‘In the resolution, therefore, of any question of jurisdiction over
a money claim arising from employer-employee relations, the first inquiry
should be into whether the employment relation does indeed still exist between
the claimant and the respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'If the relation no longer exists, and the claimant does not seek
reinstatement, the case is cognizable by the Labor Arbiter, not by the Regional
Director. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, if the
employment relation still exists, or reinstatement is sought, the next inquiry
should be into the amount involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'If the amount involved does not exceed P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
the Regional Director undeniably has jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if the amount of the claim exceeds
P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the claim is not on that account
necessarily removed from the Regional Director's competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In respect thereof, he may still exercise the
<span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement powers vested in him by
Article 128 of the Labor Code, as amended, supra; that is to say, he may still
direct his labor regulations officers or industrial safety engineers to inspect
the employer's premises and examine his records; and if the officers should
find that there have been violations of labor standards provisions, the
Regional Director may, after due notice and hearing, order compliance by the
employer therewith and issue a writ of execution to the appropriate authority
for the enforcement thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
this power may not, to repeat, be exercised by him where the employer contests
the labor regulation officers’ findings and raises Issues which cannot be
resolved without considering evidentiary matters not verifiable in the normal
course of inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such an event,
the case will have to be referred to the corresponding Labor Arbiter for
adjudication, since it falls within the latter's exclusive original
jurisdiction.”’<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question was also posed and again resolved in the judgment of
the Court <i>en banc</i> in <i>Maternity Children's Hospital v. the Secretary
of Labor</i>, promulgated on <st1:date year="1989" day="20" month="6">June 20,
 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This judgment sustained the authority of the Regional Director to command
enforcement of money claims pursuant to his enforcement and <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span>
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It declared that Executive Order
No. 111 "merely confirms/reiterates the enforcement/adjudication authority
of the Regional Director over uncontested money claims in cases where an
employer-employee relationship still exists," and that "it has always
been the intention of our labor authorities to provide our workers immediate
access (when still feasible, as where an employer-employee relationship still
exists) to their rights and benefits, without being inconvenienced by
arbitration/litigation processes that prove to be not only nerve-wracking, but
financially burdensome in the long run.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The separate concurring opinion<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
pointed out, citing Section 2 of R.A. No. 6715, that in addition to their <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> powers, "Regional Directors have also been
granted adjudicative powers, albeit limited, over monetary claims and benefits
of workers, thereby settling any ambiguity on the matter."</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not think we should overrule these precedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems to me evident that, as the above
cited rulings state, the power conferred by Article 128 on the Regional Directors,
as authorized representatives of the Secretary of Labor, is quite distinct from
that granted to them by Article 129.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 128 clearly refers to the Regional Directors' <i>"<span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement power,"</i> whereas Article
129, as already pointed out, treats of what Mme. Justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera
describes as their <i>"limited adjudicative power,"</i> i.e., their
authority to hear and determine complaints for recovery of wages and other
monetary benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Directors' <span class="SpellE"><i><u>visitorial</u></i></span><i><u>
and <span class="SpellE">enforcerent</span> power</u></i> includes the authority
-</p>

<p class="NUM">1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to inspect an
employer's premises and records to aid in enforcement of the Labor Code or
determine violations of any labor law, wage order or rules and regulations
issued pursuant thereto;</p>

<p class="NUM">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
the event that the findings of labor regulation officers disclose such
violations -- entailing, e.g., payment of monetary benefits to employees -- to
order and administer such payment, after due notice and hearing, and to issue
writs of execution to the appropriate authority for enforcement of orders of
payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the Regional Directors' power -- to order
and administer, after due notice and hearing, compliance with the labor
standards provisions of this Code and other labor legislation based on the
findings of labor regulation officers or industrial safety engineers made in
the course of inspection, and to issue writs of execution to the appropriate
authority for the enforcement of their orders -- is conferred on them by
Article 128 <i>"(t)he provisions of Article 217 ** to the contrary
notwithstanding."</i> What Article 128 is plainly saying is that although
the power of compulsory arbitration over violations of the Labor Code and other
labor legislation -- ­including payment of wages and other pecuniary benefits <i>amounting
to more than P5,000.00 for each employee</i> -- is lodged by Article 217 in
Labor Arbiters, and not in Regional Directors, the Regional Directors may
nevertheless wield the authority to order "compliance with the labor
standards provisions of ** (the) Code and other labor legislation" and
issue execution in that connection, through proceedings more summary than those
before Labor Arbiters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The "clear purpose" of the law in extending such a
power on the Regional Directors is, according to Policy Instructions No. 7 of
the Department of Labor and Employment, to take labor standards cases from the
arbitration system and place them under the enforcement system and in this way,
"assure the worker the rights and benefits due to him under labor standard
laws <i>without having to go through arbitration</i> ** (for) the worker <i>need
not litigate</i> to get what legally belongs to him ** (and the) whole
enforcement machinery of the Department of Labor exists to insure <i>its
expeditious delivery to him free of charge.</i>"</p>

<p class="BODY">Also worthy of note is that as regards this power granted to
Regional Directors by said Article 128 -- to issue orders requiring compliance
with labor laws, rules and regulations for the payment of money or otherwise,
and cause execution thereof -- only two (2) limitations can be found in the
text of the article.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first is where the employer -</p>

<p class="NUM">1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“<span class="GramE">contests</span>
the findings of the labor regulation officer,” and</p>

<p class="NUM">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“<span class="GramE">raises</span>
issues which cannot be resolved without considering evidentiary matters that
are not verifiable in the normal course of inspection."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In such an event, of course, execution
may not issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction to resolve
the issues thus raised passes to the proper Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second limitation is where the relationship of
employer-employee no longer exists, in which cases the Regional Directors cease
to have jurisdiction to order compliance with the Code or other labor
legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from these, no other limitation, particularly as to the
amount of the pecuniary benefits declared to be due and owing to employees, is
found in Article 128.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
as already discussed, notwithstanding that the Labor Arbiters have exclusive
original jurisdiction under Article 217 to hear and determine cases involving
recovery of wages and other monetary claims and benefits in an amount <i>exceeding
P5,000.00</i> for each complainant employee, the Regional Directors are
accorded the authority, to repeat, to order "compliance with the labor
standards provisions of ** (the) Code and other labor legislation" and
issue execution in connection therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides the <span class="SpellE"><i>visitorial</i></span><i> and
enforcement power</i> given to Regional Directors by Article 128, they (or any
authorized hearing officer) have also been granted by Article 129, as already
indicated, <i>quasi-<u>judicial or adjudicatory authority</u></i> to try and
decide, through summary proceeding and after due notice, complaints involving
the recovery of wages and other monetary claims and benefits arising from
employer-employee relations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Provided</i>,
That such complaint does not include a claim for reinstatement, and <i>Provided
further</i>, that the aggregate of the money claims of each employee or <span class="SpellE">househelper</span> does not exceed P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, obviously, the law envisions the situation in Article 129 to
be quite distinct from that in Article 128.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The formulation of two separate articles dealing with one and the same
situation would otherwise make no sense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first refers to inspections conducted by authorized representatives
of the Secretary of Labor or Regional Director, including labor regulations
officers, which result in the unearthing of the failure of an employer to
comply with labor standards provisions of the Labor Code or other labor
legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second situation refers
to complaints filed by employees or persons employed in domestic or household
service for the recovery of wages and other monetary claims and benefits,
including legal interest, which the Regional Directors may try and decide
unless the employment relationship no longer exists or the amount claimed for
each complainant exceeds P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this second situation, obviously, what is
invoked and involved is not the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> or
enforcement power, but the limited adjudicatory or quasi-judicial power, of the
Regional Directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situations being
dissimilar, their regulation and governance are, as they should be, also
different, as already above indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">To interpret Article 128 as subject to the same limited coverage
as Article 129, or, therefore, applicable only to claims not in excess of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, is not justified by the text of those
provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would result in undue
constriction of the rule laid down for the benefit of employees and laborers;
require the latter, contrary to the law's "clear purpose" stated in
Policy Instructions No. 7, to litigate, go through arbitration, to obtain that
to which they are clearly entitled and which they ought to have expeditiously
and free of charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
interpretation would allow an employer, disclosed as having violated labor
standards prescribed by law, by pleading lack of jurisdiction on the part of
the Regional Director because the amount due the affected employee exceeds P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, to delay enforcement of a clear liability against
which he has no meritorious defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would significantly emasculate a provision intended -- to borrow again from the
language of Policy Instructions No. 7 -- to make the Regional Office
"perform its real function:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>act as
a strategic checkpoint against labor standards cases maturing into arbitration."</p>

<p class="BODY">It also bears repeating that the exclusionary phrase, "the
provisions of Article 217 of this Code to the contrary notwithstanding,"
with which Article 128 (b) prefaces its conferment upon the Secretary of Labor
and Employment or his duly authorized representatives of the powers therein specified
is of so plain and unambiguous a meaning as to warrant only one
conclusion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that quite apart from the
fact that both provisions deal with distinct, and distinguishable powers, the
grant in Article 217 to the Labor Arbiters of original and exclusive jurisdiction
over claims in excess of P5,000.00 arising from employer-employee relations,
does not operate to oust Regional Directors of their <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span>
and enforcement powers <span class="SpellE"><i>vis-a-vis</i></span> labor
standards infractions also involving amounts exceeding such sum. A contrary
reading would do violence to the language of said phrase and render it entirely
meaningless.</p>

<p class="BODY">Application of the P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> - limitation
to the visitorial or enforcement powers of Regional Directors may even lead to
absurd results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the
Regional Director will be deemed to be validly exercising <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span>
enforcement power in a situation where each of 100 employees is found to be
entitled to monetary benefits amounting to an average of P4<span class="GramE">,990.00</span>
(a total of P499,000.00), but not where, say, 10 employees are each found
entitled to P5,005.00 (a total of only P50,050.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also incongruous is the situation where, say,
50 of 100 employees are found to have a right to benefits amounting to P4<span class="GramE">,990.00</span>, and the other 50, to P5,005.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, the case would have to be
referred to the Labor Arbiter insofar as its affects the 50 employees to each
of whom monetary benefits of P5<span class="GramE">,005.00</span> are due; this
would bring about a splitting of jurisdiction, since the case would still
remain with the Regional Director as regards the 50 workers entitled to not
more than P5,000.00 each.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And all these things may come to pass even if the employer, as in the case at
bar, fails to contest the findings of the labor regulations inspectors or
otherwise presents no justifiable excuse for the discovered violations of labor
standards laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">I therefore vote to GRANT reconsideration.</p>
