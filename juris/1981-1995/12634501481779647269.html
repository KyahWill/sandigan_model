				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, in his administrative
complaint and supporting affidavit both verified on <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1969</st1:date>, charged lawyer Vicente <span class="SpellE">Acsay</span> with negligence (amounting to gross misconduct) in
not filing, in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, a case against
Enrique de Leon who was indebted to <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span> in the sum
of P8<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tejada</span> paid P200 to <span class="SpellE">Acsay</span> in May
or June, 1967 so that the case could be filed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tejada</span> alleged that <span class="SpellE">Acsay</span>
fraternized with De Leon and that because <span class="SpellE">Acsay</span> did
not sue De Leon, he (<span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>) hired another lawyer in
May, 1969 to file the case, Civil Case No. 11832, <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>
vs. De Leon, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
but the writ of attachment issued in that case could not be enforced because De
Leon had sold his house and lot on March 9, 1968 and he had no other properties
that could be attached.<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Acsay</span> in his 16-page answer
denied the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recounted in
detail the extrajudicial measures which he utilized with <span class="SpellE">Tejada's</span>
knowledge in order that De Leon would settle out of court his liability to <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Acsay</span> sent demand letters to De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was referred to the Solicitor General for
investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1974</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span> filed a motion for the withdrawal of his
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged therein that he
was satisfied that <span class="SpellE">Acsay</span> had not been lax, negligent <span class="GramE">nor</span> unmindful of his obligation to <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>
and that the collection case filed against De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was compromised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tejada</span> took the witness stand to ratify
his motion for the withdrawal of his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General recommends that this disbarment case be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding that recommendation to be in order, the instant
administrative case is dismissed and considered closed.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
