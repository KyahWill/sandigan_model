				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for the issuance of
a restraining order seeks to nullify the resolutions issued by the respondent
Civil Service Commission, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
Resolution No. 88-820 dated November 7, 1988 reversing the decision of the
Merit Systems Protection Board dated February 5, 1988 which sustained the
decision of the Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports dated May 4, 1987
upholding the appointment of Mr. Victor A. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> as
Supply Officer I in the DECS, Division of San Pablo City; and (2) Resolution
No. 90-224 dated February 27, 1990 denying the motion for reconsideration with
prayer for issuance of temporary restraining order for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Victor A. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, then
holding the position of Clerk II, Division of City Schools of <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, was
designated on <st1:date year="1984" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1984</st1:date>
as Officer-in-Charge of the Division Supply Office by the DECS Regional
Director <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Magturo</span>
(Annex "H", petition, p. 55, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) in view
of the retirement of the Supply Officer I, Mr. Jose I. <span class="SpellE">Aviquivil</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to such designation, or from the period <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1984</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1984</st1:date>, petitioner was
designated as Property Inspector and In-Charge of the Supply Office performing
the duties and responsibilities of the Supply Officer I (p. 55, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) years thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1986" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1986</st1:date>, the Division Superintendent of City
Schools of <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Milagros <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>, issued a promotional appointment to
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> D. de la Paz as Supply
Officer I in the DECS Division of San Pablo City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She assumed and performed the duties and
functions of the position and received the compensation and benefits <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At<span style=""> </span>the time of her
appointment, private respondent was then holding the position of Clerk II,
Division of City Schools of <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="8">August
 25, 1976</st1:date> to September 1983, she was designated as Assistant to the
Supply Officer (DECS decision, p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Service Regional Office IV approved
her appointment as permanent "provided that there is no pending
administrative case against the appointee, no pending protest against the
appointment, nor any decision by competent authority that will adversely affect
the approval of (the) appointment" (Annex "A" Comment of CSC, p.
164, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">One (1) month after, or on October 20, 1986 petitioner filed a
protest with the DECS Secretary questioning the qualification and competence of
private respondent for the position of Supply Officer I.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="5">May
 4, 1987</st1:date>, DECS Secretary Lourdes R. <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>
sustained the protest of petitioner and revoked the appointment of private
respondent as Supply Officer I thus:</p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing comparative statement of the
qualifications of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and Mrs. De la Paz,
apparently the former has a decided advantage over the latter in terms of education,
experience and training.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further
examination of the comparative statement shows that Mrs. de la Paz has had no
relevant in-service training course attended and completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, therefore, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> is preferred to Mrs. de la Paz for appointment as
Supply Officer I.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Based on all the foregoing and as records further show that
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> is competent and qualified to hold the
subject position and possesses the eligibility requirement, this Office finds
the instant protest meritorious and hereby rules and so rules that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> be appointed Supply Officer I in place of Mrs. de la
Paz, whose appointment thereto is deemed revoked." (p. Annex
"C", pp. 30-31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent then filed her petition for reconsideration of
the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> DECS decision but the same was denied
by Secretary <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span> in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the bases of the aforementioned rulings of the DECS Secretary,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> was issued a permanent appointment
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1987</st1:date> as
Supply Officer I by the DECS Regional Director Pedro San Vicente effective <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of his appointment, petitioner assumed the duties and functions of the
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said appointment was
approved by the Civil Service Regional Office IV on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">For her part, private respondent de la Paz filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1987</st1:date> a notice of appeal
with motion to maintain <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> to the Merit Systems
Protection Board (MSPB) which, on <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="2">February
 5, 1988</st1:date>, rendered a decision upholding the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> as Supply Officer I (Annex "D" petition,
pp. 33-35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the MSPB, private respondent appealed to
public respondent Civil Service Commission (CSC).</p>

<p class="BODY">In Resolution 88-820 dated November 7, 1988, public respondent
CSC found the appeal of private respondent meritorious, thus revoking the
appointment of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and restoring
private respondent de la Paz to her position as Supply Officer I, DECS, Division
of San Pablo City under her previously approved appointment (Annex
"B", petition, pp. 26-29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">From said decision, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration
with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding no merit to the motion for
reconsideration filed by petitioner public respondent CSC issued Resolution No.
90-224 dated <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1990</st1:date>
denying said motion (Annex "A", petition, pp. 21Â­-24, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition seeking the reversal of public respondent
Commission's action on petitioner's appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) interrelated issues on the extent of authority of the
Civil Service Commission to pass upon the contested appointments were raised by
petitioner which could be simplified into whether or not public respondent Civil
Service Commission committed grave abuse of discretion in revoking the
appointment of petitioner Victor A. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> as Supply
Officer I in the DECS Division of San Pablo City as it found private respondent
<span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> de la Paz better qualified.</p>

<p class="BODY">In assailing the two (2) CSC Resolutions revoking his
appointment, petitioner invokes the ruling of this Court in the case of
Santiago v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 81467, October 27, 1989, 178
SCRA 733 and <span class="SpellE">Galura</span> v. Civil Service Commission, G.R.
85812, June 1, 1989 (En Banc resolution) that the Civil Service Commission has
no authority to revoke an appointment on the ground that another person is more
qualified for a particular position for that would have constituted an
encroachment on the discretion vested solely in the appointing-authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Service Commission cannot exceed
its power by substituting its will for that of the appointing authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of petitioner's cause, the Solicitor General stresses
the wide latitude of discretion given to the appointing authority in the
selection and appointment of qualified persons to vacant positions in the civil
service which was emphasized by the Court as rationale for the rule laid down
in <span class="SpellE">Luego</span> v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 69137,
August 5, 1986, 143 SCRA 327, Central Bank v. CSC, G.R. No. 80455-56, April 10,
1989, 171 SCRA 744, <span class="SpellE">Patagoc</span> v. CSC, G.R. No. 90229,
May 14, 1990, 185 SCRA 411, that public respondent CSC, not being the
"appointing power" in contemplation of law, has no authority to
revoke an appointment on the ground that another person is more qualified for a
particular position and that the Commission has no authority to direct the
appointment of a substitute of its choice.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have consistently applied the above doctrine in many cases
with similar factual circumstances, but <span class="GramE">We</span> see no
compelling reason to apply the same in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases cited above, <span class="GramE">We</span>
ruled that the Civil Service Commission has no authority to revoke an
appointment simply because it (CSC) believed that another person is better
qualified than the appointee for it would constitute an encroachment on the
discretion solely vested on the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation is different, as in the instant
case, where the Civil Service Commission revoked the appointment of the
successful protestant, petitioner herein, principally because the right to
security of tenure of the prior appointee, private respondent herein, to the
contested position had already attached (see CSC decision, pp. 28-29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
noted that public respondent CSC did not direct the appointment of a substitute
of its choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely restored the
appointment of private respondent who was first appointed to the contested
position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that private respondent was issued a permanent
appointment on <st1:date year="1986" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1986</st1:date>
as Supply Officer I in the DECS Division of San Pablo City effective <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of <span class="GramE">the of</span>
said appointment which was approved by the Civil Service Regional Office No.
IV, private respondent assumed and performed the duties and functions of the
position as Supply Officer I and received the compensation and benefits of the
said position in accordance with the mandate of Section 9 par. (h) <span class="GramE">of</span> the Civil Service Law (P.D. 807, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In consonance with the
doctrine laid down in Villanueva v. <span class="SpellE">Balallo</span>, G.R. No.</span>
L-17745, October 31, 1963, 9 SCRA 407 that an appointment is complete when the
last act required of the appointing power has been performed, but later
qualified in <span class="SpellE">Favis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Rupisan</span>,
G.R. No. L-22823, May 19, 1966, 17 SCRA 190, that the acts of the head of a
department or office making the appointment and the Commissioner of Civil
Service acting together, though not concurrently, but consecutively, are
necessary to make an appointment complete, the permanent appointment extended
to private respondent, under the circumstances of the case, is deemed
complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, she is entitled to
the protection of the law against unjust removal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion of respondent Commission in the questioned
decision that private respondent is more qualified than petitioner merely
supports the validity of the restoration of private respondent to her
previously approved appointment considering that she meets the prescribed
qualification standards required of the position of Supply Officer I and the
appropriate civil service eligibility to wit:</p>

<blockquote>EDUCATION:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bachelor's degree with training in Supply
Management</blockquote>

<blockquote>EXPERIENCE:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> None required</blockquote>

<blockquote>ELIGIBILITY:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Supply Officer; Career Service (Professional)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that once an appointment is issued and the
moment the appointee assumes a position in the civil service under a completed
appointment, he acquires a legal, not merely equitable right (to the position),
which is protected not only by statute, but also by the Constitution, and
cannot be taken away from him either by revocation of the appointment, or by
removal, except for cause, and with previous notice and hearing (<span class="SpellE">Mitra</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21691, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 15, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 21 SCRA
127.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is also authority for the rule that when the appointing
power has once acted and the appointee has accepted the office and done what is
required of him upon its acceptance, his title to the office becomes complete,
and he can then be removed only in the regular way (<span class="SpellE">Mechem</span>,
Law of Public Offices and Officers, Sec. 461, p. 294, citing <span class="SpellE">Marbury</span> v. Madison, 1 <span class="SpellE">Cranch</span>
(U.S.) 137).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointing power cannot
effect his removal indirectly by rescinding or revoking his appointment after
it is complete.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus reasonable ground for the rule that the moment the
discretionary power of appointment has been exercised and the appointee assumed
the duties and functions of the position, the said appointment cannot be
revoked by the appointing authority on the ground merely that the protestant is
more qualified than the first appointee, subject however to the condition that
the first appointee should possess the minimum qualifications required by
law.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the security of tenure
guaranteed by Article IX-B, Section 2 <span class="GramE">par</span>. (3) <span class="GramE">of</span> the 1987 Constitution would be rendered meaningless if
the appointing authority is allowed to flip-flop in exercising its
discretionary power of appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>While a protest is a mode
of action that may be availed of by the aggrieved party to contest the
appointment made, the protest must be "for cause" or predicated on
those grounds provided for under Section 19 par. (6) of the Civil Service Law
(P.D. 807), namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the
appointee is not qualified; (2) that the appointee is not the next-in-rank; (3)
and in case of appointment by transfer, reinstatement, or by original
appointment, that the protestant is not satisfied with the written special
reason or reasons given by the appointing authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have defined the concept of "for cause" in
connection with removal of public officers in the case of De <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> v. <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>, G.R. No. L-3881, August 31, 1950, 87 Phil. 289, as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It means for reasons
which the law and sound public policy recognized as sufficient warrant for
removal, that is, legal cause, and not merely causes which the appointing power
in the exercise of discretion may deem sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is implied that officers may not be
removed at the mere will of those vested with the power of removal, or without
any cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the cause must
relate to and affect the administration of the office, and must be restricted
to something of a substantial nature directly affecting the rights and
interests of the public."</p>

<p class="BODY">The ground relied upon by petitioner in his protest that he is
more qualified than private respondent in terms of education, experience and
training does not fall within the meaning of "for cause" contemplated
by Article IX-B, Section 2 par. (3) <span class="GramE">of</span> the 1987
Constitution which would warrant the revocation, if not removal, of the
appointment of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither does it fall under the grounds of appeal contemplated under
Section 19 par. (6) <span class="GramE">of</span> the Civil Service Law (P.D.
807).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the protest of
petitioner did not adversely affect the approval of the appointment of private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the assumption that the revocation of private
respondent's appointment was validly exercised by DECS Secretary <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>, still the appointment extended to petitioner
was tainted with irregularity as it was issued before the finality of the
decision on the protest in violation of CSC Resolution No. 83-343 which
prohibits the issuance of an appointment to protestant (petitioner) if the
protest case is not yet finally resolved, since there is no vacancy in the
position pending resolution of the protest case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no appointment to a non-vacant
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent must first be
legally removed or his appointment validly terminated (<span class="SpellE">Costin</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-32271, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="27" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 27, 1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> 120 SCRA 159.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
appointment to an office which is not vacant is null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> (<span class="SpellE">Morata</span> Court of Appeals, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18975,
</span><st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 25, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 11 SCRA 42.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">CSC Resolution No. 83-343 provides thus:</p>

<blockquote>"An appointment though contested shall take effect immediately
upon issuance if the appointee assumes the duties of the position and (the)
appointee is entitled to receive the salary attached to the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise such appointment shall become
ineffective in case the protest is finally resolved in favor of the protestant,
in which case the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> shall be reverted to his
former position." (p. 223, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Records reveal that the decision of the DECS Secretary revoking
the appointment of private respondent was rendered on <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1987</st1:date> and the motion for reconsideration
filed by private respondent was denied on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appointment issued to petitioner as Supply Officer I was dated
August 11, 1987 and he assumed the position on October 26, 1987 (date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of his appointment) as reported by the Schools
Division Superintendent of San Pablo City (pp. 77-78, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From all indications, the appointment of
petitioner dated <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1987</st1:date>
was issued with undue haste before the finality of the denial of the motion for
<span class="SpellE">reconsieration</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the appointing authority has a wide
latitude of discretion in making his choice in the selection and appointment of
qualified persons to vacant positions in the civil service, We cannot, however,
give a stamp of approval to such a procedural irregularity in extending
appointments, as in the instant case, to the prejudice of the right to security
of tenure of the incumbent to the position.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DENIED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1987</st1:date> and the resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1987</st1:date> of the respondent

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MELENCIO-HERRERA, <i>J</i>.:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I am constrained to take exception to the conclusion of the
majority that the right to <span class="GramE">security</span> of tenure of
private respondent to the contested position had already attached.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that private respondent's appointment on 19
September 1986 was approved as permenant by the Civil Service Regional Office
IV <u>subject to certain conditions</u>, namely, "(1) that there is no
pending administrative case against the appointee; (2) no pending protest
against the appointment, (3) nor any decision by competent authority that will
adversely affect the approval of (the) appointment" (numbering supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, a protest against the appointment was timely filed
by petitioner on <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="10">20 October 1986</st1:date>
questioning the qualification and competence of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The protest was sustained by the Secretary of
the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) on <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="5">4 May 1987</st1:date> on the ground that petitioner had a
"decided advantage over private respondent in terms of education,
experience and training." Petitioner was thus appointed in place of
private respondent whose appointment was deemed revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a decision by competent authority
adversely affecting the approval of private respondent's appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conditions Nos. 2 and 3 having supervened,
private respondent could not have assumed the contested position under a
completed appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
private respondent had acquired no legal right to security of tenure that would
have entitled her to removal only "for cause."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, it was petitioner who was<span style=""> </span>issued <span style="">a </span><u>permanent</u>
appointment by the DECS Regional Director on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">11 August 1987</st1:date>, effective on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10">26 October 1987</st1:date> when petitioner assumed the duties and
functions of the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
appointment was approved by the Civil Service Regional Office IV on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="10">27 October 1987</st1:date>, without any
qualifications or conditions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's Motion for Reconsideration of the<span style=""> </span>DECS decision on petitioner's protest
was denied by that department on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">11
 August 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A notice of
appeal was filed by private respondent to the Merit Systems Protection Board <span style="">(MSPB) </span>on <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="10">18 October 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="2">5 February 1988</st1:date>,
the MSPB upheld petitioner's appointment.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, however, by private respondent to the Civil Service
Commission, the latter body on <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="11">7
 November 1988</st1:date>, found the appeal meritorious, revoked petitioner's
appointment, and "restored" private respondent to her position
"under the previously approved appointment," on the ground that private
respondent was "better qualified" (Decision, p. 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CSC denied the reconsideration sought by
petitioner on <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">27 February 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the, circumstances, it can not be denied that, in,
resolving private respondent's appeal to it, the CSC had substituted its own
choice for that of the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The general rule, therefore, must apply:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the discretion exercised by the appointing power, in extending an
appointment to a given position to one <span style="">of
</span>two employees possessing the requisite minimum qualifications for the
position, will not generally be interfered with and must be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Service Commission has no authority
to revoke the said appointment simply because it believes that another employee
is better qualified for that would constitute an encroachment on the discretion
vested solely in the appointing authority (Dr. Mariquita Mantala v. Hon.
Ignacio Salvador, GR No. 101646, February 13, 1992, citing, Luego v. Civil
Service Commission, 143 SCRA 327; Central Bank v. Civil Service Commission, 171
SCRA 744; and Santiago, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission, 178 SCRA 733).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">To state that respondent CSC "did not
direct the appointment of a substitute of its choice but merely restored the
appointment of private respondent who was first appointed to the contested
position" (p. 7.</span> Decision) is misleading and inaccurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could have been no
"restoration" as private respondent's appointment never attained
permanency by reason of the conditions that effectively hindered, it from acquiring
that status, namely, the timely protest and the decision by competent authority
adversely affecting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason
thereof, there was no completed appointment much less any security of tenure to
speak of that would have entitled private respondent to the protection of the
law against unjust removal (pp. 7-8, Decision).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing considerations, I vote to grant the
Petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is petitioner Aquino who
should be appointed to the contested position, not private respondent De la
Paz, following our consistent pronouncements on the matter, espoused in the
strongest terms in some instances, that the CSC exceeds its power when it
substitutes its will for that of the appointing authority.</p>
