RODOLFO A. ORTIZ, JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF QUEZON

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The sole issue presented
in the instant appeal is whether or not a verbal lease of an apartment unit
where the rentals are paid monthly, may legally be terminated by notice at the
end of any given month and consequently, the judicial eviction of the lessee
from the premises may subsequently be effected on the conceded ground of
personal need thereof by the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> son and his
family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question has already been
answered in the affirmative by this Court, and the same answer will now be
given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In 1973 petitioner
Miranda leased a unit of a three-door apartment belonging to him to private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, in consideration of a monthly
rental of P200.00, which was later increased to P242.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their agreements were oral, and dealt only
with the rental rates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The duration of
the lease and other matters usually treated of in contracts of this nature were
evidently never even discussed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On May 31, 1979 Miranda
sent a letter to <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> asking her to vacate the
apartment unit on or before September 1, 1979 because the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
married son and his family, who had </span>been theretofore residing with him,
having no dwelling unit of their own, could no longer be comfortably
accommodated in his (Miranda's) own residence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The request was reiterated in a letter of Miranda's lawyer dated <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1979">August 6, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the deadline came and passed without <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>
vacating the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So on <st1:date month="10" day="3" year="1979">October 3, 1979</st1:date>, Miranda filed with
the City Court a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, grounded on the personal need of Miranda's son,
who had no dwelling unit of his own, of the apartment occupied by Mallari.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">1</span></span></a> The City Court's verdict, promulgated on <st1:date month="7" day="20" year="1981">July 20, 1981</st1:date>, went against Miranda
however.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court ruled that Miranda
could not repossess the subject apartment unit notwithstanding his married
son's need to use the same as his dwelling because the verbal contract of lease
with <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> had<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">not expired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Miranda appealed to the Court of First Instance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">2</span></span></a> Again he was rebuffed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its decision rendered on <st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1982">January 26, 1982</st1:date>, the Court, presided
over by respondent Judge, affirmed that of the City Court <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE">toto</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The
Court held that while there was real need by the petitioner to repossess the
premises for his married son's use, this being set out in Section 5 <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(c) </span>of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilang</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>25 as a ground for the judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of a lessee, the provision could not apply since
the verbal lease did not prescribe a definite period and therefore could not be
said to be terminable on notice at the end of every month; this was because
Section 6 of the same <span class="SpellE"><i>batas</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">pambansa</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>had
suspended the legal periods established in Article 1687 of the Civil Code,
these periods being "understood to be from year to year, if the rent
agreed upon is annual; from month to month, if it is monthly; from week to
week, if the rent is weekly; and from day to day, if the rent is to be paid
daily." His motion for reconsideration having been denied by the
respondent Judge, Miranda has appealed to this Court on the question of law,
"Whether or not the period of the verbal lease agreement between petitioner
and private respondent has expired within the meaning of Section 5 (c) of B.P.
25."</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the issue has already
been raised and resolved by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rivera v. <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>promulgated on <st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1986">July 31, 1986</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a> this
Court made the following pronouncement, <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">viz</i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"What is suspended under Section 6 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 is Article 1673
of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and not Article 1687 of the same Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The effect of said suspension is that independently of the grounds for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> enumerated in Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, the owner/<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
cannot eject the tenant by reason of the expiration of the period of lease as
fixed or determined under Article 1687.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It does not mean that the provisions of Article 1687 itself had been
suspended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">the determination of the period of a lease agreement can still be made
in accordance with said Article 1687</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Admittedly, no definite period for the lease was agreed upon
by petitioners and private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, as the rent was paid on a monthly basis, the period of lease is
considered to be from month to month in accordance with Article 1687.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When petitioners gave private respondent
notice to vacate the premises in question, the contract of lease is deemed to
have expired as of the end of the month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As we have ruled in <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

Appeals, supra</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

if it is shown that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> needs the property for
his own <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">use </span>or for the use of
any immediate member of the family or for any of the other statutory grounds to
eject under Section 5 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, which happens to be applicable, then the lease is
considered terminated as of the end of the month, after proper notice or demand
to vacate has been given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> v. Court of Appeals, 116
SCRA 199).'</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>" * * * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The law * <span class="GramE">* ,</span> Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, ( in its
Section 5[c] ) * * allows <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> on the ground of
need by the owner/<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of the leased premises for
his own use or that of a member of his immediate family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inclusion of this ground was obviously
intended to correct the inequity and hardship imposed by P.D. 20 on small
landowners/<span class="SpellE">lessors</span>, whose property rights, protected
as they are by the fundamental law itself, <span class="GramE">We</span> upheld
even during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of P.D. No. 20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To adopt, therefore, the construction given
by respondent court is to render Section 5 (c) of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 illusory in cases where the lease agreement
is verbal and for an <span class="SpellE">indefininte</span> period, because in
this case, the owner/<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, notwithstanding his
pressing and urgent need for the premises could never successfully eject the
tenant as the period of lease would never expire during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
