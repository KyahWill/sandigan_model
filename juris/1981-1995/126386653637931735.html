				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Manila Hotel Corporation,
et al., G.R. No. 83250, September 26, 1989, We overruled a decision of the
Court of Tax Appeals which declared the collection of caterer’s tax under
Section 191-A of Republic Act No. 6110 illegal because Sec. 42 of House of Bill
No. 17839, which carries that proviso, was vetoed by then President Ferdinand
E. Marcos when the bill was presented to him and Congress had not taken any
step to override the presidential veto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We held thus:</p>

<blockquote>“The power of the State to impose the 3%
caterer’s tax is not debatable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Tax Appeals erred, however, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>holding
that the tax was abolished <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>a
result of the presidential veto of <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="8">August
 4, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It failed to
examine the law then, and up to now, existing on the subject which has always
imposed a 3% caterer’s tax on operators of restaurants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the Manila Hotel operates restaurants
in its premises, it is liable to pay the tax provided in paragraph (1), Section
206 of the Tax <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Code.” </span>(Commissioner

<p class="BODY">The petition now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> presents an
identical question:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>whether the presidential veto referred
to the entire section or merely to the imposition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

restaurants, refreshments parlors, bars and other eating places which are
maintained within the premises or compound of a hotel, motel or <span class="SpellE">resthouses</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reference to the Manila Hotel case, therefore, might have been
sufficient to dispose of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>this

position of the <st1:street><st1:address>House Ways</st1:address></st1:street>

those who serve food and drinks, the intention was to classify and to

restrained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These reasons have been
taken together in the interpretations of the veto message and the <span class="GramE">deletions of such enterprises as are connected with the tourist

</span>An “item” in a revenue bill does not refer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the word “item” as referring to the whole section would tie the President’s hand
in choosing either to approve the whole section at the expense of also
approving a provision therein which he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">deems
</span>unacceptable or veto the entire section at the expense of foregoing the
collection <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of the </span>kind of tax
altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evil which was sought to
be prevented in giving the president the power to disapprove items in a revenue
