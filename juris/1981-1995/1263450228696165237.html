				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Petition for review by
way of appeal under Republic Act 5440 of the partial judgment rendered by
respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte, Branch III and dated September 22, 1957 in its Civil Case No. 2882, an
action for annulment of contract and specific performance entitled Philippine
Smelters Corporation </span>vs. San Mauricio Mining Company, et al., which
subsequently was <span style="">overtaken and
consolidated with the appeal of the final judgment of the same case by the same
judge rendered on August 21, 1979, which although first appealed to the Court
of Appeals, by motion of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, to which
appellants expressly manifested they had no objection, was ordered by Us to be
forwarded to this Court in our resolution of March 12, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the briefs of appellants San
Mauricio Mining and <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span> &amp; Co., and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>, who came later as an <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>,
as well as that of Philippine Smelters Corporation, as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
had already </span>been <span style="">filed with the
Court of Appeals, (but sent to this Court with the record of the other case.)
and so, only the reply brief of appellants was filed directly with this Court
followed in due time by the Rejoinder to Appellant's Brief filed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> dated </span><st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="7"><span style="">July 18, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
further pleading appears in the record to have been filed by appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For reasons that would be obvious later in this decision, and
considering the view We are taking of the appeal of the final judgment of the
trial court of August 21, 1979, We will first dispose of the said later
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our decision of the latter will
make the petition for review of the partial judgment virtually moot and
academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The subject matter of
these cases refer to a parcel of </span>land located at <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, with an area appearing to be a
little over 200 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was titled
in the name of herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Philippine
Smelters Corporation, hereinafter to be referred to as SMELTERS, in Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 13060 of the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte by virtue of deed of sale in its favor
executed on December 29, 1975 by the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation,
hereinafter to referred to as NASSCO, the then holder of Torrens Title OCT 0440
over the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, however,
SMELTERS subdivided the property into several lots and obtained in consequence
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 13502 to 13521, inclusive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy over said property started on February 28, 1977,
because prior to that date, or, to be more exact, on August 16, 1976, herein
petitioners<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(1)</span></span></a> San Mauricio Mining Company,
hereinafter to be referred to as SAN MAURICIO, and <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span>
&amp; Company, Inc., hereinafter to be referred to as MARSMAN, caused, thru
their co-petitioner<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(1-a)</span></span></a> Pedro L. <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>,
to be annotated first on the original title of NASSCO, then on the first title
of SMELTERS, an annotation of adverse claim, which was subsequently carried
over in its later titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, the
thrust of the said annotation was the claim of SAN MAURICIO and MARSMAN that, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, (1) on November 23, 1973, a contract of
sale and assignment of rights over the same <span style="">property was executed by NASSCO <span style="">in
favor of SAN MAURICIO; (</span>2) on June 26, 1975, NASSCO also executed a deed
of assignment of rights over part thereof <span style="">in </span>favor of <span style="">MARSMAN; </span>and
(3) </span>by <span style="">virtue </span>of <span style="">a sheriff's certificate of sale, MARSMAN
acquired the mining rights, claims, and improvements over the entire area which
were previously foreclosed by <span style="">MARSMAN, </span>hence,
the owner thereof became <span style="">MARSMAN and
NASSCO </span>had no right at all to transfer it to SMELTERS. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(See pp. 2-3 of Appellants' Brief.)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And <span style="">so, on </span>said date, February 28, 1977,
SMELTERS filed the herein subject complaint with the trial court, </span>as <span style="">Civil </span>Case <span style="">No. 2882, asking for "Removal of Cloud over (its) Torrens
Certificates of Title, (and) Declaration of Nullity of Adverse Claim and (for)
Damages".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer, SAN
MAURICIO and MARSMAN alleged that on November 19, 1957 SAN MAURICIO executed in
favor of NASSCO a deed of absolute sale of the "<u>surface rights</u>"
over 144.62 hectares of land covering its twenty mineral claims in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte
(meaning part of the land in question), "subject to a collateral
understanding between them to the effect that when NASSCO stops operation of
the smelting plant thereon, or abandons the cite, SAN MAURICIO would have the
first option to reacquire the <u>'surface rights</u> over its said mineral
claims and all the improvements thereon', and that pursuant to said collateral
agreement, on November 23, 1973 NASSCO <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to
it for a consideration of P200,000.00 the so-called <u>'surface rights</u>,
etc.' and (further), that on June 26, 1975, NASSCO further <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>
to MARSMAN, as successor-in-interest of SAN MAURICIO, all the <u>'surface
rights</u>' over the mineral claims of the latter --embracing an (additional)
area of 32.595 hectares." (Underlining Ours)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And most important of
all, defendants claimed that "long prior to the sale executed by SAN
MAURICIO -- </span>in <span style="">favor of NASSCO
dated November 19, 1957, the first had valid and subsisting load claims staked
by it within the area in dispute herein, under and pursuant to the provisions
of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, <u>a list of which together with the
particulars of each claim appear­ing in Annex A-6 of the complaint</u>, that
MARSMAN -- having succeeded to all the rights and interests of SAN MAURICIO
over the said claims duly applied for recognition of its mining rights pursuant
to Section 101 of Presidential Decree No. 463 and by order of the Director of
Mines of September 23, 1976, (?) duly recognized the mining rights of the
defendant MARSMAN --" (Underlining Ours) Thus, defendants and herein
appellants SAN MAURICIO and MARSMAN, posit in conclusion that <span style="">the </span>sale made by NASSCO in favor of
plaintiff, (herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) </span>dated December
29, 1975, ---covering the properties embraced by the mineral claims of the
(said) defendants --is null and void---"</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evidently to <span class="SpellE">reenforce</span> their position in their answer, on May 17, 1977,
SAN MAURICIO and MARSMAN filed a third-party complaint against NASSCO, the
Director of Lands, the Commissioner of Land Registration and the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, alleging <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> (and in a more detailed manner) that SAN
MAURICIO, for and in consideration of the sum of P200,000.00 executed in favor
of NASSCO a Deed of Absolute Sale of the <u>surface rights</u> over 144.62
hectares of land covering 20 of its alleged patentable lode claims situated in
Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte, allegedly located by its predecessors-in-interest under and pursuant to
the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, together with all the
improvements thereon, to enable the government to implement the decision of the
then National Economic Council, pursuant to the provisions of the Republic Act
No. 1396, choosing Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte to be the site of the first pig iron
smelting plant in the Philippines; that there was a collateral agreement in
said Deed of Absolute Sale between SAN MAURICIO and NASSCO to the effect that
when NASSCO stops the operation of the smelting plant or abandon the site, or
whenever in the judgment of NASSCO the area as acquired from SAN MAURICIO is in
excess of its actual needs, SAN MAURICIO would have the option to reacquire
from NASSCO the surface rights over its mineral lode claims and all
improvements thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"It is further
alleged that in November, 1973, NASSCO, for economic and technological reason
stopped the operation of smelting plant, and in the meantime, SAN MAURICIO
decided to develop its mineral lode claims in the area in view of which SAN
MAURICIO applied with NASSCO for the repurchase of the surface rights and
improvements transferred by it under the Deed of Absolute Sale of November 19,
1957, subject to reten­tion by NASSCO of <u>such surface rights</u> as it may
still need for its actual requirements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to said request of SAN MAURICIO, NASSCO supposedly <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to SAN MAURICIO on November 23, 1973, all its rights
and interests over the surface rights covering the 12 mineral lode claims of
SAN MAURICIO as listed in the said deed for P200,000.00 and a Contract of Sale
and Assignment of Rights was executed in favor of SAN MAURICIO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Contract of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Sale</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and Assignment of Rights was supposed to
have been approved by the Office of the President on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="1"><span style="">January
 15, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> under the
first endorsement of the same date of the Assistant Executive Secretary, Mr.
Rolando B. Zamora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 21, 1974
MARSMAN acquired all the rights, title and interests of SAN MAURICIO in and to
all the patentable mining claims of the latter in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
including all the surface rights and improvements acquired by NASSCO from SAN
MAURICIO under the Deed of Sale of November 19, 1957, as the highest bidder for
the sum of P3,961,935.75 at the public auction thereof, conducted by the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte; that on April
30, 1975 and May 29, 1975, MARSMAN sent to NASSCO a communication whereby
MARSMAN offered to repurchase from NASSCO all such rights and improvements
thereon which are in excess of the actual needs of NASSCO, MARSMAN having
decided to continue and pursue the development of the mineral lode claims
acquired it and NASSCO, in consideration of the fact that its smelting plant
only needed about 10 hectares out of the area facing the <span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span>
Bay, agreed by a Deed of Assignment of Rights dated June 26, 1975 to assign to
MARSMAN the surface rights over the mineral lode claims described, registered
in the name of SAN MAURICIO covering 32,575 hectares, together with all
improvements thereon for and in consideration of the sum of P32,595.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid Deed of Assignment of Rights
executed by NASSCO in favor of MARSMAN was approved allegedly by authority of
the President on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="7"><span style="">July 1, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">''The Third-party
complaint also states that on June 23, 1975, MARSMAN paid the sum of P45,000.00

13,5244 (sic) hectares; that on July 4, 1975, SAN MAURICIO and MARSMAN, for and

MARSMAN for recognition of mining rights pursuant to Section 101 of PD 463.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"MARSMAN and SAN MAURICIO alleged further that <span style="">on </span>December 29, 1975, NASSCO, claiming
title and ownership over a parcel of land consisting of 170.2890 hectares
situated in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> under and by authority of
PD 837 transferred and conveyed ownership thereto in favor of SMELTERS for and

of SMELTERS, together with a certain <span style="">area
</span>of about 50 hectares, which embraces all the mineral lode claims,
surface rights and improvements belonging to MARSMAN and SAN MAURICIO; that
under the provisions of PD 843 (this should be 837), the Bureau of Lands was
directed to resurvey the property where it was found that the area was 170.2890
hectares only but actually it was made to appear that the area of 202.1945
hectares or 32 hectares in excess of that legally authorized under PD 837; that
pursuant to said PD, the Commissioner of Land Registration issued the
corresponding decree which served as the basis for the issuance by the Register
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte covering transfer
Certificate of Title No. 0440 on August 6, 1976, in the name of NASSCO which

not 202.1945 hectares as shown in Plan Pad-252381 but actually 202.3 hectares,

to establish the genuineness of the signature of Mr. Zamora on the disputed

approval of the Office of the President of the said contract, was lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relevance and importance of the approval
by the Office of the President of said contract cannot be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only because the contract by its nature

Zamora in Exhibit H as well as J-7 and now on Exhibit U-1 is not your
signature?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, my name is <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>,
and I certainly would not sign any document which bears a different name as
Rolando B. Zamora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make sure that
there are no possible errors about this, may be I should recall that possibly
eight or maybe ten individuals would have a chance to see my name typewritten
in the ordinary course of passing upon papers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, there would be the Records Office which would receive this
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the records Office, in
the Office of the President, it would then go to the legal office, and
presumably the typist there, ….No, I'm sorry, Can I …. yes, it would first go
to the Records Office and then it would be assigned to an action attorney who
would prepare a draft or who would dictate a draft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This draft would be typed by one of our
typists in the Legal Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I
presume that the typist, having typed my name many number of times, possibly
could not have typed the incorrect name, this would then go to the action
attorney and he would be the second person to see the wrong name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action attorney would then submit to his
group head, and that individual would be the third person to see my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would then go to the Head of the Legal Office
and that would be the fourth individual to see my name typewritten
wrongly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would then be transferred to
my office, keeping in my mind that my office is physically separate from the
Legal Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would then go to the <span style="">Records Office in my personal office and then
clerk in charge would be the sixth individual to see the wrong name and then
one of my assistants would take a look and he would be the seventh person to </span>see
<span style="">the error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, finally, it would go to me and quite
naturally I would be very, very particular about signing my signature over a
wrong name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it would go back to
my records clerk for release from my office and he again would have a chance to
see the wrong name, and so that is the eight individual; and it would go back to
the Records Office in the Legal Office and that would be the ninth person to
see the wrong name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it would be
released to the Central Records Office in the Office of the President in <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> for release and the persons there would be </span>the
tenth individual to see my wrong name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it is pretty obvious that I would not sign over a wrong name so that
the presumption is that I did not or I would not have signed this particular <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact is, there are many small nuances that may not be appreciated by the
general public in the preparation of papers in my office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing we never returned an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to a particular office or corporation or an
agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in this case, it says,
'Respectfully returned to the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASSCO) <span style="">xxx'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We
are very particular in returning an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to a
particular individual for a very good reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We think <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> should be addressed to an
individual because <span style="">that individual
would be responsible for actions on that <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>,
we always put the precise location of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this instance, we would have put the
General Manager, National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASSCO), </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have many good reasons for that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
government offices have different physical locations in Metro Manila and in the
province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we were to return it not to
an individual but just to NASSCO, and NASSCO probably has a number of offices
thru-out the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, one could just imagine the confusion as to
where this kind of <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> should be
referred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, we do not simply say
that a contract is approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are very
particular in stating that something is hereby approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because it is not anything else but that
particular <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> is addressed the authority to
effect what is to be effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing
else but that particular <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the hereby there is not just a <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
very important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is what gives
authority to a</span> particular official to do an official act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also we never include redundancies like, and
I quote from the 1st <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> -- 'xxx and
therefore may be given force and effect.'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is something we feel should be remove from <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span>
because they are mere redundancies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a
contract is approved, it should<span style=""> </span>be
given force and effect and any statement that says it gives it force and effect
does not add one iota of authority to that particular <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, there are a number of <span style="">signs </span>and countersigns that the
office, through years of practice, has laid down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, although again this <span style="">is </span>only a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copy, I do not see any mark of initial, keeping in mind that all <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> prepared by the Legal Office goes through
several lines of authority. <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Some initials should appear here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, there is a number or figure, there are
some sort of routing numbers, and these routing numbers are assigned to the
offices in the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of the Legal Office, the routing number is 1277.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were prepared in the Legal Office,
that number 1277 would appear not only in the </span>duplicates, in the copies,
but would appear even on the original.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not present in this <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy being
shown to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were prepared in my
personal office then it would bear another number, from 1 to 4, and two numbers
correspond to the typist and to the action attorney within my office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for these reasons that I feel that this
<span style="">is </span>a forgery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also take note that the particular
letterhead that we use in the Legal Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If I remember right, what we have been using is '<span class="SpellE">Tangapan</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>', not 'Office of the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>',
especially for local communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
letterhead shown in this exhibit is for ...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>is the letterhead that we use for outside, meaning outside the Philippine,
communications where it may be difficult for them to understand, <span style="">although of course under this '<span class="SpellE">Tanggapan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>' there is a small transla</span>tion here, Office
of the President of the Philip<span style="">pines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Ordinarily, as I said, for local official
communications, we use '<span class="SpellE">Tanggapan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>.'</blockquote>

because every individual has lapses of memory, at the Office of the President,
we have adopted certain safeguards against lapses of memory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, if that contract were sent to
the Office of the President, then our Records <span style="">Office </span>would retain one copy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is the Central Records Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the Legal Office would retain another copy which is why we
have required offices to submit contracts, to submit not just the original
contract but also duplicates, triplicates and quadruplicates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, this seems to be a disposal of a
government property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then certainly the
instructions to be given to me would be given by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that the President would
sign approvals, because ordinarily he would not, and it is for the Executive
Secretary or the Assistant Executive Secretary who would approve it for his<span style=""> behalf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it would have to be shown<span style=""> </span>the President personally and the President
personally would probably have indicated in the ordinary course of events his
approval of the contract itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you
would see there a short approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would indicate Approved then with an initial or the full signature of the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of these appears in the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would say that if I would not remember
correctly, then these safeguards would help me remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in the course of the investigation of the
NBI, they also showed me a copy of a certification from our Records Office that
there was no such document in our files.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps I should mention that early in my time as Assistant Executive
Secretary, I was made Chairman of the Presidential Records Management Committee,
let me get the exact words, Presidential Records Management Committee,
especially since all of these records are, not all but say 70% or 75% are
important legal records of the Office of the President, and they come and go to
the Legal Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since I was
Chairman, we built precisely these safeguards; again, as I said, to <span class="SpellE">foretall</span> lapses of memory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If there is no copy in the Records Office, then I would assume that the
original was not sent to the Records Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It might have been possibly brought directly to the President, an
extremely rare case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this happens,
then the Records Office would not have the copy of the contract as it goes
directly to <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the instance where the President
would call you directly and give you instructions, in which case, there would
not be any record going into the Central Records Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But<span style=""> </span>regardless
of whether it is the <span style="">President himself </span>or
it goes through the ordinary course of procedure the outgoing communications
must pass through the Records Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I understand from the certification from Director <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz that neither
the outgoing communication was recorded in his Office.' (pp. 33-48)</blockquote>

categorically stated that the papers on the sale of the property in question (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C-2) had never been submitted to him and that he had
not approved the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As against the testimony of Mr. Zamora, defendants tried to

statement of Mr. Zamora or even from creating doubt as to the truth of said
testimony, confirms and fortifies the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to say that by the testimony of Mr. Cruz, defendants were not
able to negate the affirmative assertions of Mr. Zamora in his deposition that
the signature which reads 'Rolando B. Zamora' is not his signature and that he
had not approved the Deed of Sale with Assignment of Rights supposedly executed
by NASSCO in favor of SAN MAURICIO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

with certainty if he saw the original of the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of Assemblyman Zamora although in his certification (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.

said that <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy is a faithful reproduction of
the original (PP. 77-78, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not ready to give credence to this
witness.</blockquote>

even as a notice of adverse claim unauthenticated <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copies of documents the original of which had not been shown to the Register of
Deeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the original could not be
presented for one reason or another, at least certified copies thereof should
be available for registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stability of property rights will be seriously impaired if not jeopardized if

matter were <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies of alleged original

more careful or prudent, he should have required the original documents to be
presented or certified true copies thereof by the proper office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case then could have been avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Register of Deeds should take warning
that similar incidents should not be repeated in the future.</blockquote>

SMELTERS in case of default.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The objection of defendants, therefore, as to the inadequacy
of the price is not well taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Importantly, NASSCO does not plead that the price for which it had sold
the proper<span style="">ties to SMELTERS is
unconscionable or disproportionate with its true value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hasten to conclude that the question of
the price is between NASSCO as seller and SMELTERS as buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in this particular transaction, it
belongs to the Executive Department of the government to determine what is the
reasonable price of the land NASSCO </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">selling, taking into
account primarily the announced national policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for defendants to raise this
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract having been
approved by the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, it becomes a matter of conscience for the
Executive Department to evaluate as to the reasonableness of its price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court may not just intrude into the
prerogatives of the Chief Executive.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants argue also that under the <span style="">Contract </span>of 1957 between SAN MAURICIO and NASSCO, SAN MAURICIO
was granted preferential right to reacquire the property in case NASSCO had no
more need for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Going over the
voluminous records of this case, the Court does not find that defendants had
introduced in evidence the aforesaid contract of 1957 to substantiate its claim</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>However, Assemblyman Arturo F. <span class="SpellE">Pacificador</span>, testifying on this point, claimed that he had
advised, Mr. Emilio Vito of MARSMAN of the projected sale of the property
before the Contract of December 29, 1975 between NASSCO and SMELTERS was
finalized, MARSMAN did not show any interest to reacquire said property so that
NASSCO proceeded with the sale to SMELTERS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is noteworthy that Mr. Vito, who gave his deposition twice, first in
Civil Case No. 3025, which he re-affirmed in the case at bar, did not on any
occasion, even attempt to contradict Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Pacificador</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Deed of </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Sale</u></st1:place></st1:city><u>
of 1957 does not appear to have been recorded in the Registry of Property of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, at least it was not shown to have been so
recorded</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not, therefore,
bind any third party who had subsequently acquired <span style="">the property in good faith and for value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">enough that in the
subsequent contracts of 1973 and 1975 between NASSCO and SAN MAURICIO and
NASSCO and MARSMAN, respectively, the preferential right of defendants is
mentioned, because the Court, not to say a third-party is left guessing as to
what is the nature of that right allegedly granted by NASSCO to the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the contract is
between NASSCO and the defendants and defendants should have a copy of that
contract, the Court feels that it must be the defendants who should present
that contract to prove its affirmative allegation that it has in fact a
preferential right to the property under the contract of 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the above circumstances the Court
cannot very well consider the right claimed by the defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Having disposed of the arguments of defendants against the
validity of the sale in favor of SMELTERS the next issue would be the claim of
SMELTERS for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SMELTERS claim
that it had contracted the services of at least five (5) foreign technicians,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lloyd Thomas, Leonard Kitchener,
Donald Tully, Alec <span class="SpellE">McKensey</span>, and Stanley, who came to
the Philippines to assist and give technical advice in the operation,
development and enhancement of the smelting plant for which it had spent the
amount of P500,000.00 for their <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> expenses
and per diems aside from their salaries as testified to by Jose Marcelo, Jr.,
President of SMELTERS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SMELTERS
attributes the non-full development of its smelting plant and its inability to
produce the pig iron because of the impediments created by the notice of
adverse claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is not ready to
award in full the amount as claimed by Mr. Marcelo because SMELTERS could still
avail of their counsel and services even if belatedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown, <span style="">how</span>ever, that SMELTERS had suffered
damages for it was not able to proceed immediately with the installation,
establishment and operation the smelting plant and production of pig iron.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court would, therefore, grant in the exercise
of its discretion P150,000.00 for said claim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SMELTERS claimed further that it suffered damages represented
by the difference of the costs of materials and other machineries in 1976 when
it should have acquired said items and started operation in comparison with the
costs of materials in 1978 and 1979 when it had paid for said machineries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay in the commencement of the
operation of the smelting plant was the inability of SMELTERS to obtain the
necessary <span class="SpellE">fundings</span>, a circumstance it attributes to
the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court shares the
view of plaintiff for it's supported by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loan application of SMELTERS could not be
granted by the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(DBP for short) and other financial institutions because of the annotations <span style="">of adverse claim on its titles on the
properties bought from NASSCO.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, the DBP would not grant the loan which SMELTERS tried to
obtain on the security of parcels of land burdened with a notice of adverse claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same could be said of the other private
banking institutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be able to
finally obtain loan from Development Bank of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> after a protracted delay, SMELTERS was
required to post a bond of P7.5 million for which it paid</span> premium in the
amount of P46,000.00 which <span style="">defendants
should be made answerable as an item of actual damages.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff has shown by testimony (Marcelo and <span class="SpellE">Cantiller</span>) and by documentary evidence that because of the
delay in the operation of the plant occasioned by the acts of the defendants, procurement
of necessary equipment and machineries had gone up as can be gleaned from the

prices of said equipment and machineries in 1976 as against the year 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants should be liable for the
difference because by their direct act, SMELTERS was unable to obtain the loan
in 1976 and was forced to buy the machineries in question at a much higher
price in 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If SMELTERS was able to
buy the equipment and machineries in 1976, it would have not paid higher prices
when the purchase of said equipment and machineries was finally made in 1978,
then SMELTERS would have been able to start operation in 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gain that <span style="">SMELTERS </span>would have realized in 1976, 1977 and 1978 was estimated
to be P7,168,000.00, which amount is reflected in the Project Study (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L) and testified to by Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Cantiller</span>,
General Manager of plain­tiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants were not able to show that the projected gain for the year

comprehend not only the value of the loss suffered, but also that of the
profits which could have been obtained (Art. 2200, New Civil Code). Profits or
gains (<span class="SpellE">Lucro</span> <span class="SpellE">cesante</span>) could
have been earned by plaintiff had there been no delay in the operation of the
plant which delay, as we had already stated and found, is attributable to
defendants' acts in annotating 'adverse Claims' on plaintiff's titles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to SMELTERS' claim for attorney's fees, the
Court finds that there were several lawyers who represented SMELTERS <span style="">in </span>this proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was Atty. Jules A. Mejia who signed and
filed the complaint and who handled the case until after the partial judgment
was rendered herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then there is Atty.

the circumstances that out of this case, several incidents were brought either
directly to the Supreme Court or to the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is some justification in the claim of SMELTERS for attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the
action of SMELTERS was precipitated by the annotation of adverse claim at the instance
of the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also no
serious controversy that said adverse claim was uncalled for; it lacks both
legal and factual basis and it forces SMELTERS to litigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although in the complaint SMELTERS asked only
P50,000.00 for attorney's <span style="">fees, </span>but
the services rendered by the lawyers for the plaintiff who had to come several
times <span style="">to his </span>Court <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> hundreds of kilometers back and forth, and the
importance of the questions involved, the Court believes that an award of
P150,000.00 for counsel fees in favor of SMELTERS <span style="">is </span>reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should
be stated in this connection that when the complaint was filed in February 1977
the <span style="">plaintiff </span>did not have in
mind that certain incidents <span style="">of the </span>case
will reach the appellate Courts (SC &amp; CA).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Jose Marcelo, Jr., President of plaintiff, testified on <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1979</st1:date> he informed the Court
that he has to pay his lawyers P150,000.00 each. Plaintiff has therefore proven
that it had to disburse more than what was originally stated in the complaint which
under existing jurisprudence the Court may award <span style="">in </span>excess of what is prayed for provided the award is
reasonable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants' counterclaim against SMELTERS should be, as they
are hereby denied, in view of our findings and conclusions heretofore stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Coming to the third-party complaint filed by defendants
against NASSCO, the Court believes that said third-party complaint should be
dismissed, after the Court has arrived on the conclusion above indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover the two contracts between NASSCO and
SAN MAURICIO, and NASSCO and MARSMAN does not contain any warranty, so that
defendants corporation bought the lands or any right therein at their
risk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of a warranty clause
in the aforesaid contract is significant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike ordinary contracts of sale and assignment or rights, the omission
of the warranty clause in the aforesaid <span style="">contracts
would only mean that NASSCO could not be held liable for damages if, later on,
there would arise some controversy about the transaction on the title of the land
sold by NASSCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of NASSCO in
selling the property in litigation to SMELTERS is duly authorized by law, that
is by P.D. 837 and unquestionably approved by the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
matter was fully established with the testimony of Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Pacificador</span>, former Acting Chairman of NASSCO, who in no
uncertain words said that the approval of the sale to SMELTERS by the President
was done in his presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Documentary
evidence proving the same has also been submitted by the plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. E, E-1 &amp; E-2).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>NASSCO, therefore, could not be held accountable for the sale of said
property to SMELTERS.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the corporate life of NASSCO expired on January 6,
1976, and although under Section 77 of the Corporation Law, it has three (3)
years to continue as a corporate body for the purpose of prosecuting and
defending suits by or against it and of enabling it to gradually settle and
close its affairs, to dispose of and convey its property and divide its <span class="SpellE">equital</span> stock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
three-year period has already expired on <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="1">January
 6, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court seriously
doubts whether an action against NASSCO could still be maintained after the
period provided for in Section 77 of the Corporation Law has lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court believes that after the expiration
of the three-year period after the charter of NASSCO has expired, the present
third-party complaint by defendants against NASSCO<span style=""> should be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have carefully read
the very lucid <span style="">discussion of </span>these
assignments of error, and it must be admitted that a<span style="">ppellants </span>have made a creditable and forceful presentation of
their cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taken alone, one could
readily be convinced by appellants' brief that indeed the trial court erred as
pointed out by them.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But it is most important
to note that beyond the issues so well presented and discoursed by appellants
lies the <span style="">sole point of </span>fact that
is to Our mind decisive in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the vehement and ingenious arguments and counter-arguments regarding
</span>the <span style="">validity of the documents of
sale or resale of November 23, 1973 by NASSCO to SAN MAURICIO, of June 26, 1975
<span style="">also by NASSCO i</span>n favor of
MARSMAN and other documents related may be deemed as merely peripheral and
tangential, if not immaterial, as long as it is not determined definitely what
was conveyed by SAN MAURICIO to NASSCO on November 19, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If what was transferred then included the
mining claims and mineral rights of SAN <span style="">MAURICIO,
</span>We would have no alternative than to make Our decision on that basis,
pursuing to their logical conclusion the legal effects of Proclamation 500 of
December 23, 1968 and Presidential Decree 837 of December 6, 1975 upon whatever
transactions might have transpired among the parties hereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We say that the question
of what was sold by SAN <span style="">MAURICIO to
NASSCO </span>on November 19, 1957 is the pivotal point to be determined here
because it cannot be denied that from the constitutional point of view and in
the light of the vested rights <span style="">principle,
if the </span>mineral rights and mining claims of SAN MAURICIO were perfected
before that date, and it sold to NASSCO only the </span><span style="">"<u>surface rights</u>" </span><span style="">in their 170 hectares of land, then neither Proclamation 500 nor
Presidential Decree 837 could deprive it of those mineral rights and mining
claims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with this
vital issue, <span class="SpellE">SMELTER's</span> brief posits that the very
document of transfer itself, copy of which <span style="">is </span>annexed to it as Appendix "A" is the indubitable
proof that what were conveyed <u>were not only the surface rights but the
mining claims </u></span><u><span style="">themselves</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Thus, the pertinent portion of the said
document states clearly and unequivocally:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That for and in consideration of the amount of TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND PESOS (P200,000.00), Philippine Currency, to be paid by the NATIONAL

78-79, Brief for Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot close Our eyes
to the unambiguous tenor of this quoted paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, We have no basis to discuss
"surface rights" at all, for those words do not even appear in the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two other paragraphs thereof
make explicit reference also to <u>mining claims</u>, not "<u>surface

hereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underlining ours) (Idem)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Not without some degree
of strictly technical plausibility, appellants contend that SMELTERS'
production of the above-quoted instrument of transfer of </span><st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="11"><span style="">November
 19, 1957</span></st1:date><span style=""> is out of
place in this Court, the same not having been introduced or presented as
evidence at the trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, with rare commendable candidness <span style="">in </span>advocacy,
and induced evidently by the undeniable accuracy of Appendix "A",<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(2)</span></span></a> instead of standing pat on their technical
procedural objection,<span style=""> appellants would
want Us to devalue said document by maintaining that "contemporaneous and
subsequent acts of the vendor (SAN MAURICIO) and the <span style="">vendee (NASSCO) in </span>relation therewith, covering a period <span style="">of over 16 years, clearly show </span>that
they treated the instrument of <span style="">sale to
the exclusion </span>of the 20 mining claims, since <span style="">NASSCO under its </span>charter was not authorized to engage </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">mining." (p. 5, Appellant’s Reply <span style="">Brief) </span>And the case of Nielson &amp; Co., Inc. <span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> </span>Consolidated
Mining Co., 18 SCRA 1050-1051 and <span style="">the
earlier one of </span><span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> vs. Mariano, 37 Phil.
840 are cited to support the proposition that in the construction of contracts
the intention of the parties may be proven by subsequent acts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court does <span style="">not see how the </span>cases cited can be
controlling in the </span><span style="">cases at </span><span style="">bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The primary </span>and elementary rule of
construction of documents is that when the words or language thereof is clear
and plain or readily understandable by any ordinary reader thereof, there is
absolutely no room for interpretation or construction anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the case of Nielson had in contemplation
was a contract the language of which evinced doubt as to the intention of the
parties, hence the ruling that once the intention is determined it becomes part
of it as if "originally expressed therein in unequivocal terms."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as the Mariano case <span style="">is </span>concerned, it referred to
agreements subsequent to the questioned contract and the issue was whether or
not <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence could be admitted to prove the
later agreement, and, naturally, this Court rightly held that such subsequent
agreement was not covered by the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule,
since the said rule covers only prior and contempo­raneous agreements which are
deemed to be integrated into the written contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">More importantly,
however, appellants' attempt to demonstrate the so-called ''contemporaneous and
subsequent acts of vendor and </span>vendee" <span style="">is successfully rebutted in <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
rejoinder <span style="">brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two points </span>(1) that SAN MAURICIO filed
affidavits of assessments from after 1957 is pointedly belied by Annex
"A" of the said rejoinder brief, a certificate of <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
L. de Jesus, Register of Deeds &amp; <span style="">Mining
</span>Recorder of the Bureau of Mines at <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte that is true that SAN MAURICIO owned 120
claims at <span class="SpellE">Luklukan</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, but that during the year 1958, the
San Mauricio Mining Company appears to have filed affidavits for only one
hundred (100) claims, not including the follow­ing twenty (20) claims listed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

parties having at their beck and call, what with their respective resources,
lawyers of nationally well recognized talent and ability, why did they execute
a document that anyone can only read otherwise?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under these
circumstances, We are convinced that, all technical ratiocinations
notwithstanding, the incontrovertible fact that appears clear and indisputable
is that by the Deed of Transfer of November 19, 1957, NASSCO acquired from SAN
MAURICIO not only </span><u><span style="">surface
rights</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">over the latter's land in ques­tion but
actually </span><u><span style="">its mining claims
and mineral rights</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">explicitly specified in said document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold, consequently, that neither
Proclamation 500 nor Presidential Decree 837 deprived either SAN MAURICIO or
MARSMAN of any vested rights in the lands here in dispute.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Having arrived at this
conclusion, it should be readily understandable, as it would be inevitable, how
the rest of the remaining issues in this controversy have to be resolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main prop of appellants' posture is obviously the resale or
retransfer document from NASSCO to SAN MAURICIO of November 23, 1973,
particularly because, for reasons not satisfactorily shown even by appellants
themselves, it refers to the "Deed of Absolute Sale" of November 19,
1957 as one "of the surface rights over 144.62 hectares of land covering
twenty mining claims of SAN MAURICIO - - to be the site of the Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> Smelting Plant of NASSCO."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps, if all that We had to consider were
the face of the document thus relied upon by appellants, We could probably
recognize the validity of their defenses and counterclaims herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But looking deeper into
the relevant circumstances, We cannot but realize certain insurmountable
obstacles that to Our mind completely bar the prayers of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already remarked that even the
luminous and comprehensive pleadings and briefs of appellants do not give Us a
glimpse of the inscrutable factors that led to the preparation and signing or
execution of the resale document </span><span style="">in
question </span><span style="">in its extant
tenor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If fault <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
could be attributed to a failure of the public officials who took part therein,
We can only say that as a matter of law rooted in the protection of public
interest, and also as a general policy to protect </span>the <span style="">government and the people against misbehavior
or mischief of its personnel, their errors in the performance of their duties
should never deprive the people of the right to rectify such error and recover
what might be lost or be bartered away in any actuation, deal or transaction
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be borne in mind <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the instant cases at bar that </span><span style="">NASSCO together </span><span style="">with other government owned or controlled
corporations was placed under the Uniform Charter of Government Corporations
thus partaking of the nature of a regular government or official public
entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correspondingly, therefore, the
mistakes of its officials could not legally bind the state, without prejudice
in appropriate cases where connivance or corruption is absent, to the other
party being duly reimbursed any payment it has made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have carefully read
the documents, alluded to by appellants, beginning with the resale deed of
November 23, 1973 thru the deed of assignment in favor of MARSMAN dated June
26, 1975, and, of course, all the other papers which are subsidiary thereto,
complimentary thereof or have evidently flowed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
and truth to tell, they do refer to "surface rights".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But We cannot go against the hard fact We
have found indubitably demonstrated by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that
the original transaction of </span><st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="11"><span style="">November 19, 1957</span></st1:date><span style=""> definitely referred to </span><u><span style="">mining </span></u><u><span style="">claims</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No plausible explanation has been shown of
the apparent discrepancy, and the only inference We can make out of it is that
the public officials who took part in the preparation thereof were either
unaware of the exact import of the documents or the situation they were dealing
with, or, were induced by factors which cannot be revealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the public interest involved in
the matter cannot be made to suffer, </span>as We have already explained, by
their strange or unusual actuations.</p>

<p class="BODY">What compounds the unexplained and inexplicable tenor of the
deeds and documents relied upon by appellants is that after the issuance by His
Excellency, President Ferdinand E. Marcos of Proclamation No. 500 on December
23, 1968, that is, while the deed of transfer of November 19, 1957 was still
the basis of the government's ownership of the land in question, including the
mineral or mining claims in question, the said property was withdrawn
"from sale or settlement" and placed "under the <u>administration</u>
<span style="">(only and no more) of the National
Shipyards and Steel Corporation."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon these premises, it is indubitable that NASSCO had no legal authority
whatsoever to dispose of what was placed under its administration only, and any
official of NASSCO </span>who <span style="">acted in
excess of the powers defined by the proclamation performed nothing more,
nothing less than <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span> acts
entirely devoid of any effect or force in law.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With what We have just
discussed and held it would hardly be necessary for </span><span style="">U</span><span style="">s </span>to <span style="">delve deep into the
factual issue of whether or not the Deed of Transfer dated November 23, 1973,
Exhibit C-2, was approved by the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lengthy and well rationalized discourse
of the trial court leading to the conclusion that the signature of former
Assistant Executive Secretary, now Assemblyman, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>
Zamora had been forged, a conclusion based mainly on the testimony of Assemblyman
Zamora himself, not only denying the authenticity of the signature over the
name reading Rolando Zamora (instead of <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>, his
real name) but explaining the badges therein showing lack of regularity thereof
thus reveling its falseness, satisfies Us, and We do not hesitate to give Our
assent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specially having in view
the lack of legal authority of the NASSCO officials concerned to act on the
matter in the light of Proclamation 500, We also find and hold that the
supposed transaction with MARSMAN of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="6"><span style="">June 26, 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> has not been sufficiently shown to have been
approved by then Assistant Executive Secretary Roberto Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, how could those alleged transactions
have been approved when they appeared on their faces to be <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of Proclamation 500 which had not been neither repealed nor even amended in any
manner which would make disposal by NASSCO of the property in question
permissible?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why would NASSCO retransfer
or <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> surface rights when it acquired million
claims?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Withal, looking at this
particular point in dispute from another angle, the unavoidable conclusion
would still favor <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> SMELTERS, for assuming
that NASSCO did retransfer to appellants the "<u>surface rights</u>"
referred to in the pertinent deeds, not only would the result be that the
mining claims were intentionally excluded from the retransfer but also that
NASSCO reserved the right to withdraw "anytime the use of the surface
rights from (<span class="SpellE">Marsman</span>, in particular) as public
interest may so require as may be determined by the President pursuant to the
context of Proclamation No. 500, series of 1968". (See p. 126, Record)</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(3)</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And what totally and definitely consolidated in NASSCO full
ownership of the properties herein involved-mining claims, surface rights and
improvements and all-and made its authority to dispose of and transfer the same
to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> all the more unquestionable and,
therefore, the sale impugned here indisputably valid and legal was the
legislative recognition, even if, in the <span style="">juridical
sense, this </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">practically
superfluous, of <span class="SpellE">NASSCO's</span> ownership of said prop</span>e<span style="">rties with the right, power and authority to

<p class="BODY">Corning now to the two supposedly private lands of <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos and the <span class="SpellE">Bambas</span>, comprising thirteen (13) and twenty-two (22)
hectares, respectively, We note that although NASSCO was a party to the two
compromised civil cases<span style=""> </span>involving the same, as defendant, together with SAN MAURICIO
and MARSMAN, NASSCO does not appear to be a party to "Deed of Assignment
and Quitclaim Rights to Real Property" dated June 23, 1975, Annex 5 of SAN
<span class="SpellE">MAURICIO's</span> and <span class="SpellE">MARSMAN's</span>
third party-complaint nor to the Deed of Sale by the <span class="SpellE">Bambas</span>
of July 4, 1975, Annex 6, id.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More, it
is expressly stipulated in Annex 5, just referred to, that "(T)his sale or
assignment and quitclaim made in favor of the Second Party (<span class="SpellE">Marsman</span>)
is deemed subject to whatever rights that the National Shipyards and Steel
Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Nassco</span>), party defendant in Civil Case
No. 1613 aforementioned, may still have, if any in the area", thereby
indicating that NASSCO had not compromised its own claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, We find Ourselves in no position <span style="">in </span>the instant cases at bar to make
any final ruling regarding the said properties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those lands of <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> and the <span class="SpellE">Bambas</span>
were involved in Civil Cases Nos. 1613 and 1452 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They appear to be private agricultural lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the records of those cases are not before
Us in the instant proceedings, neither the papers of the amicable settlement
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider Ourselves unable to
make any definite ruling as to them, considering particularly, that the trial
court made no particular finding regarding them in its rather extensive
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, We
have no alternative but to decide the present cases only insofar as they affect
the deeds of November 23, 1973 and June 26, 1975 in relation to the acquisition
of NASSCO of the mining claim of SAN MAURICIO on November 19, 1957, as above
discussed, without prejudice to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> taking
the correspond­ing legal steps to make clearer its rights over the 38 hectares
just mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, We hold
and declare that the sale by NASSCO on December 29, 1975 to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
SMELTERS of the lands covered by the deed of SAN MAURICIO in favor of NASSCO of
November 19, 1957, bearing as it does the President's approval on January 6,
1976 <span style="">(See </span>Annex 1 of Comment of
defunct NASSCO dated February 12, 1979) is legal and valid, the alleged<span style=""> inadequacy, or even "immorality"
of the considerations therein stated notwithstanding, the justification of the
stipulated consideration being sufficiently discussed in the decision of the
trial court, with which We find no cogent reason to disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As His Honor well pointed out, the price
alleged by appellants is in truth even inaccurate, for the amount of money
actually paid </span>by SMELTERS, as stipulated in the deed is much <span class="SpellE">much</span> more, in addition to obligations undertaken by the
buyer to rehabilitate <span style="">and develop </span>the
<span style="">property and smelting plant which will
require a considerable sum, justly adequate for which it bought what is
practically a long abandoned junk that had lost its original purchase price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have read the deed itself and take
judicial notice of the relevant circumstances surrounding its execution as such
are indicated in the appealed decision and hereby confirm His Honor's
conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the damages assessed by the trial court against
appellants, We consider the amount awarded by the trial court as supported by
the evidence of record and the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the prayer for additional damages of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
ought to be submitted for evaluation by the trial court in a subsequent hearing
for the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered affirming the
decision of the trial court dated August 21, 1979, subject to the
qualifications stated in the above opinion as to the de <span class="SpellE">los</span>

of SMELTERS' reply to the answer (referred to in paragraph (d), pp. 37-38 of

not inconsistent but are, on the contrary in line with said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
fundamental position, sustained by Our foregoing opinion, that in view of
Proclamation 500 and P.D. 837, <span class="SpellE">NASSCO's</span><span style=""> right and authority to sell the properties
in question to SMELTERS cannot be legally affected by such purported retransfer
