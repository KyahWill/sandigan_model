Information for the crime of Murder was filed against Prudencio Damiar, 
Crispulo Damiar, Porferio Damiar, Bailon Monroy, Cecilio Rosario, 
Rodrigo Boncales, Leoncio Licanda and two unidentified persons 
designated as John Doe and Richard Doe before the then Court of First 
Instance of Samar, docketed as Criminal Case No. C-1106.  At the 
arraignment, all the accused pleaded not guilty, except Prudencio Damiar
 who claimed the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender, 
provocation on the part of the deceased, passion and obfuscation.
<p>
After trial, the lower court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, accused Prudencio Damiar, Porferio Damiar, Bailon 
Monroy and Leoncio Licanda are hereby found guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime of murder and sentences them as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "(a)  with respect to Porferio Damiar, Bailon Monroy and Leoncio
 Licanda there being proven the aggravating circumstances of taking 
advantage of superior strength and by a band, without any mitigating 
circumstance to offset the same, to DEATH; </p>
    <p> "(b)  with respect to accused Prudencio Damiar there being no 
mitigating or aggravating circumstances to consider after offsetting the
 same, to RECLUSION PERPETUA; and </p>
    <p> "(c)  that all said accused Porferio Damiar, Bailon Monroy, 
Leoncio Licanda and Prudencio Damiar to jointly and severally indemnify 
'the heirs of the deceased Alvaro Palacio the sum of P6,000.00 and to 
pay the costs. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "Accused Crispulo Damiar alias Crispon Damiar, Cecilio Rosario and
 Rodrigo Boncales are hereby acquitted of the Crime charged for failure 
of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, with 
costs de oficio. </p>
  <p> "The release is hereby ordered unless they are held for another offense." (pp. 91-92, Rollo) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On October 14, 1980, this Court issued a resolution dismissing the case 
against Porferio Damiar with respect to his criminal liability on the 
ground that he died on July 27, 1977 "as confirmed by the death 
certificate Submitted by the Director of Prisons, through the Solicitor 
General."
</p><p>
The facts, as established by the evidence for the prosecution, are as 
follows:  On August 9, 1964, Alvaro Palacio with his parents, went to 
the island of Panganoron, within the jurisdiction of the municipality of
 Capul, Samar, to see their coconut plantation and to tell their 
tenants, among whom were Blas de la Vega and Emilio Balat, to make 
copra.
</p><p>
On August 14, 1964, about 3:00 in the afternoon, Alvaro Palacio, Blas de
 la Vega and a Moro fisherman left for the farm of Blas to get 
vegetables and sweet potatoes.  While walking along a trail with the 
Moro leading the way, followed by Alvaro and Blas, they heard several 
gun blasts and immediately the Moro ran towards the house of Martin 
Palacio.  Alvaro fell Blas de la Vega, who was about eight meters 
behind, dashed towards the bushes on the right side of the trail and 
there lay prone on the ground.  Looking up, Blas saw nine (9) persons 
emerge from the tall grasses but he recognized seven (7) only, namely:  
accused Bailon Monroy, Porferio Damiar, Rodrigo Boncales, Leoncio 
Licanda, Prudencio Damiar, Cecilio Rosario and Crispulo Damiar.  
Thereafter, he saw Bailon Monroy shoot Alvaro Palacio who was already 
lying on his side, with a .45 caliber pistol.  This was followed by 
Leoncio Licanda who fired at close range, about a yard away from the 
victim.  Porferio Damiar then held Alvaro by the hair and, with a bolo, 
made a thrust at the body of the latter.  The others:  Crispulo Damiar, 
Cecilio Rosario, Rodrigo Boncales and Prudencio Damiar were each 
carrying a carbine, and they were around, about a meter away, during the
 shooting and stabbing incident.
</p><p>
After the group had left, Blas went out of his hiding place and ran to 
the house of Emilio Balat and told the latter everything he had seen.  
Emilio went to fetch Philippine Constabulary soldiers.  In an hour he 
was back with two (2) PC officers who questioned Blas about the 
incident.  They then went to the scene of the crime, placed the deceased
 Alvaro Palacio on a cot and carried him to the house of Martin Palacio 
in Panganoron.
</p><p>
Post-mortem examination of the deceased, Alvaro Palacio, was conducted 
by Dr. Manuel Buñag, Municipal Health Officer of San Antonio, Samar and 
his findings were:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.  gunshot wound at the upper part of the neck the bullet 
entering on the left lateral side below the left ear, 1 cm. in diameter 
and exiting at the right side below the right ear.  (p. 11, tsn., Sept. 
5, 1966 Hearing) </p>
  <p> "2.  gunshot wound caused by the bullet entering the left lateral 
side of the thorax, below the left axilla, and behind the midaxillary 
line.  The bullet traversed the thorax and lodged beneath the skin on 
the opposite side of the body.  The bullet was extracted; wounds 1 and 2
 were both 1 cm. in diameter (p. 13, t.sn., Id). </p>
  <p> "3.  a pair of gunshot wounds on the anterior surface of the right
 arm below the right shoulder, the upper wound measuring 3 1/2 cms. and 
the lower one measuring 2 1/2 cms. (marked as 'e' and 'f', respectively 
in Exh.s. A-1).  The guns could have been fired at close range because 
the wounds were black showing signs of gunpowder burns (pp. 16, 27, 
tsn., Id.) </p>
  <p> "4.  a gunshot wound on the same arm, 4-1/2 cms. below the two 
wounds, measuring 2-1/2 cms. and penetrating to the opposite side of the
 arm.  The exit wound measured 3 cms. with powder burns on the anterior 
parts of the arm near the bullet's point of entrance (p. 18, tsn., Id.).
 </p>
  <p> "5.  gunshot wound at the back below the right shoulder, measuring
 2-1/2 cms. in diameter, penetrating the thoraxic cavity, with no 
visible point of exit for the bullet (p. 19, tsn., Id.) </p>
  <p> "6.  an incised, wound located at the left side of the chest, near
 the base of the neck, below the left clavicle, measuring 2-1/2 cms. 
penetrating the thorax, possibly damaging the left lobe of the lung.  
This wound was caused by a sharp pointed instrument, possibly by a small
 bolo (pp. 20-21, tsn., Id.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to Dr. Buñag, wounds 1, 2, 5 and 6 were fatal and possibly 
three kinds of weapons were used, namely:  a small caliber weapon, a big
 caliber weapon and a sharp bladed instrument.  Death was due to 
internal hemorrhage.
</p><p>
Alvaro Palacio, at the time of his death, was 28 years old, a bachelor and a second year commerce student.
</p><p>
Appellant Leoncio Licanda testified that about 3:00 in the afternoon of 
August 14, 1964 he was on his way to his farm in Panganoron when he met 
Alvaro Palacio, Blas de la Vega and a Moro coming from an anchorage, 
called Looc, and he heard Blas said:  "Go to your house at Sitio 
Katorse." Alvaro Palacio and the Moro left for Sitio Katorse, while he 
and Blas went up the hill to his (Licanda) coconut plantation.  Few 
minutes after he had arrived in his farm, the Moro came and was asking 
for Blas.  He told him that Blas proceeded to the upper hill.  Upon 
observing that the Moro was pale, he inquired what had happened and he 
was told that Alvaro was shot by someone he did not know because he did 
not see.  He certainly did not have anything to do with the slaying of 
Alvaro Palacio and suspected that he was implicated because Blas could 
be interested in the land he was working on.
</p><p>
Accused-appellant Bailon Monroy declared that he is the son-in-law of 
Bartolome Solarta who has a land case with Martin Palacio, father of 
Alvaro.  He was in Tarnate and Sila, with Cpl. Arsolon on August 14, 
1964.  He denied having anything to do with the death of Alvaro Palacio.
</p><p>
Appellant Prudencio Damiar admitted having shot to death and stabbed the
 deceased with a bolo because the latter has been pestering him.  When 
Alvaro and the Moro arrived in his house at Sitio Katorse on August 14, 
1964, Alvaro took the eggs from the nest and the rooster which was in 
the yard and, thereafter, handed them to the Moro.  He tried to retrieve
 them but the deceased held his left hand and pushed him.  Alvaro then 
pulled his .45 caliber and shot at a rooster, after which the two left. 
 He got his carbine, followed end hid behind the banana plants.  When 
the deceased and the Moro were approaching, he fired at Alvaro, two or 
three times.  The deceased turned around and, at that juncture, he 
unsheathed his bolo, approached his victim and held the head.  Upon seeing
 that his eyes were still moving, he made a thrust on the right side of 
the clavicle.  He then took the .45 caliber pistol from the deceased and
 then shot him with it.  Thereafter, he went to the beach, rode in a 
banca for Tarnate to surrender, as he did to the Chief of Police.  He 
was alone when he killed Alvaro Palacio.
</p><p>
Commenting on the evidence presented by both parties, His Honor, the trial judge said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A careful analysis of the evidence presented for the prosecution 
and the defense, shows that there is no question to the fact that the 
deceased Alvaro Palacio died for having been shot and stabbed by a 
bladed instrument in Sitio Katorse wherein the nearest house is only 
around 75 meters away.  The only thing to be resolved is whether the 
deceased was killed by nine persons, seven of whom are the accused 
herein as contended by the prosecution or only by accused Prudencio 
Damiar as maintained by the defense.  This Court believes and so holds 
that the deceased, while walking in Sitio Katorse at the very place 
where the nearest house is only around 75 meters away, was ambushed when
 he suddenly and without any warning received a barrage of gunfire and 
when lying prostrate on the ground was fired upon by Bailon Monroy and 
Leoncio Licunda with a .45 caliber pistol one after the other and that 
there­after Porferio Damiar stabbed him.  The testimony of Blas de la 
Vega on the ambush and the subsequent firing by Monroy and Licanda and 
the stabbing by Porferio Damiar is worthy of belief especially when we 
consider his demeanor on the witness stand and the nature of his 
testimony.  Said testimony even became clearer end convincing during the
 cross-examination especially when he was required to demonstrate his 
position while hiding behind the bushes and how each of the accused, 
Monroy, Licanda and Porferio Damiar shot and stabbed the deceased.  It 
would be impossible to conceive how Blas de la Vega, an illiterate, 
could testify in the manner he did despite the rigid cross-examination 
had he not been really at the scene of the crime.  If his testimony is 
fabricated it would be easier for him to impute on all the seven accused
 certain criminal acts and not only limit it to three.  The fact, 
however, that the other three accused, namely:  Rodrigo Boncales, 
Cecilio Rosario and Crispulo Damiar alias Crispon Damiar were at the 
scene of the crime will not be enough to make them liable.  It is a well
 known rule that without proof of conspiracy, mere passive presence at 
the scene of the crime does not constitute complicity (People vs. 
Silvestre, 56 Phil. 53; People vs. Samano, et al., 77 Phil. 136).  There
 was no showing in the instant case that the said four accused, one way 
or another, conspired for the killing. </p>
  <p> "On the other hand, the defense of Porferio Damiar, Bailon Monroy 
and Leoncio Licanda like all the other accused is mere alibi and their 
presence is not so far away from the scene of the crime as Porferio 
Damiar was in the same island of Panganoron where the deceased was 
ambushed or in a farm around 400 meters away where the deceased was 
killed; that Bailon Monroy was in the island of Tarnate which is only 
around 1 1/2 miles away from the island of Panganoron; and Leoncio 
Licanda was also in the same island of Panganoron when the incident 
happened. </p>
  <p> "The Court has ruled every now and then that the defense of alibi,
 one of the weakest defenses oftenly resorted to by the accused, cannot 
prosper where the accused had been positively identified by the offended
 party and witnesses (People vs. Gecole, et al., CA - 43, O.G. 3772).  
This doctrine has been repeatedly reiterated by the Supreme Court in 
People vs. Arpon, G.R. No. L-9044, prom. January 29, 1957; People vs. 
Umali et al., 54 O.G. 347, wherein it was said that the defense of alibi
 is considered too weak to overcome the positive, clear and satisfactory
 evidence of the prosecution pointing to the accused as the planners and
 authors through participation of the death of the deceased.  Moreover, 
to establish an alibi, the accused not only show that he was present at 
some other place about the time the crime was committed but also that he
 was at another place for so long a time that it was physically 
impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was 
committed either before or after the time he was at such other place.  
(People vs. Pili, 51 Phil. 965; People vs. Resabal, 50 Phil. 780).  It 
will be noted that right after the identification of the seven (7) 
accused and the criminal acts of the three of them namely:  Bailon 
Monroy, Leoncio Licanda and Porferio Damiar, Blas de la Vega immediately
 told the incident to Emilio Balat right on that same day and this 
spontaneity of identification and narration of the criminal act 
immediately after the commission of the crime and the lack of strong 
motive on the part of said De la Vega to implicate the seven (7) accused
 especially accused Porferio Damiar, Bailon Monroy and Leoncio Licanda 
are guarantees of veracity.  (People vs. Pabilar, G.R. L-7012, prom. 
November 12, 1956).  His sincerity is further proven when he did not 
impute any criminal act on the part of the other four accused, namely:  
Cispulo Damiar, Cecilio Rosario, Rodrigo Boncales and Prudencio Damiar, 
but only their presence.  It is true that witness Blas de la Vega gave a
 statement (Exh. '1-PD', '1-ML', '1-BD', '1-R') during the preliminary 
investigation before Judge Victor Cabili, Municipal Judge of Capul, 
Samar, wherein there appear statements which the defense claimed to be 
contradictory to what he stated in open court.  But said contradictions 
are not on material points and do not affect whatsoever the substance of
 the testimony.  At any rate, De la Vega, who is unschooled and do not 
even know how to read and write explained that he cannot understand why 
the discrepancies appeared therein.  In accordance with judicial 
experience, affidavits are, as a general rule, unreliable evidence and 
therefore any discrepancy that it may have if satisfactorily explained 
does not discredit the witness.  (People vs. Timbang, 74 Phil. 295; U.S.
 vs. Lazaro, 34 Phil. 871).  An eminent author also said that ex-parte 
affidavits are generally incomplete, often for want of suggestion and 
inquiries ( 2 Moore on Facts, Sec. 938). </p>
  <p> "The Court has also found that the killing is accompanied by treachery, taking advantage of superior strength and by a band. </p>
  <p> "There is treachery when the deceased while walking in the trail, 
was suddenly and without any warning fired upon and stabbed by the 
accused who were then hidden (People vs. Dosal, G.R. Nos. L-4214 and 
L-4316, prom. April 17, 1953) thus employing method which insured the 
commission of the crime and at the same time eliminate (or diminish) the
 risk to their own persons from the defense that the deceased might 
offer.  Abuse of superior strength is shown by the fact that there are 
four armed accused who helped one another while deceased was lying 
prostrate on the ground and the four accused still fired at and stabbed 
the deceased (U.S. vs. Tandoc, 40 Phi. 954), abusing therefore their 
superior strength not only as to their number but also to their arms.  
Likewise, the crime was committed by a band as there were more than 
three armed malefactors who acted together in the commission of the 
offense (People vs. Laoto, et al. 52 Phil. 44).  The Court cannot admit 
uninhabited place as an aggravating circumstance because there was no 
clear evidence that the accused purposely sought the solitude of the 
place in order to better attain their purpose.  Moreover, it is a place 
where the nearest house is around 75 meters away where help therefore is
 not impossible to come.  The prosecution also failed to prove scoffing 
at the corpse of the victim and evident premeditation. </p>
  <p> "It is clear therefore that the crime of murder was committed 
qualified by treachery with the aggravating circumstances of taking 
advantage of superior strength and by a band. </p>
  <p> "On the other hand, the Court considers the mitigating 
circumstances of plea of guilty and voluntary surrender in favor of the 
accused Prudencio Damiar only but which mitigating circumstances are 
offset by the aggravating circumstances of taking advantage of superior 
strength and by a band.  The Court can not find in favor of the other 
accused any mitigating circumstance." (pp. 192-197, Record). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellants claimed that the trial court erred (1) in convicting Porferio
 Damiar, Bailon Monroy and Leoncio Licanda of the crime of murder, and 
in sentencing them to suffer the horrible penalty of death giving full 
faith and credit to the testimonies of Blas de la Vega and Emilio Balat,
 (2) in not finding the testimonies of Blas de la Vega and Emilio Balat 
fabricated, utterly biased, highly incredible and improbable and replete
 with inconsistencies on material points, and unworthy of credence, (3) 
not finding the evidence of the said accused-appellants more worthy of 
credence, and in not acquitting them, (4) in appreciating the 
aggravating circumstances of "taking advantage of superior strength" and
 "by a band" against appellant Prudencio Damiar who voluntarily 
surrendered and owned full responsibility of the killing of the 
deceased, (5) in not appreciating the mitigating circumstances of 
"passion" and "obfuscation" in favor of appellant Prudencio Damiar, and 
(6) in sentencing appellant Prudencio Damiar to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua.
</p><p>
The first three assigned errors raise the question of credibility of 
witnesses - Blas de la Vega and Emilio Balat.  Appellants point out that
 Blas could not have witnessed the incident because a person in his 
situation would have run as far away and as fast as he could, instead of
 lying prone for about 20 minutes and observing the minute details of 
the incident as they happened.
</p><p>
We are not in agreement with this view.  Persons react differently to a 
given situation.  Some would have really run away and be fired at by the
 assailants to do away with an eyewitness; others would do what Blas de 
la Vega did, to avoid detection and see what would transpire before him.
  Thereafter, it was only natural to inform Emilio Balat what he saw 
because the deceased had been staying at the latter's house.
</p><p>
However, We take note of the fact that while the incident happened on 
August 14, 1964, it was on September 10, 1964, almost a month after, 
when Blas de la Vega executed an affidavit in question and answer form 
before the Municipal Judge of Capul, Samar and wherein he failed to 
state that Leoncio Licanda fired at the deceased.  Hereunder is what he 
said in his affidavit, Exhibit "1-PD', "1-ML", "1-BD", "1-H."

    A     I went to the house of Martin Palacio at Panganoron, then I 
notified his tenant, Emilio Balat and immediately Emilio Balat fetched 
the PC detachment at Maragat, Capul, Samar, and then Emilio Balat left 
for Dalupirit to notify Martin Palacio, father of Alvaro Palacio.

It was during the trial of the case when De la Vega testified that 
Licanda shot the deceased with a .45 caliber pistol (p. 14, Appellee's 
Brief).  His failure to state in said Affidavit the fact that Leoncio 
Licanda also fired at the deceased, and to declare during the 
preliminary investigation about Licanda's participation - a very essential
 detail in the solution of the crime - engenders a suspicion that Blas 
de la Vega was not candid and truthful in his testimony on this point.  
The omission on so important a matter has rendered the evidence for the 
prosecution insufficient to establish Licanda's guilty connection to the
 requisite of moral certainty.  He falls in the same category as Crispulo
 Damiar, Cecilio Rosario and Rodrigo Boncales who were acquitted by the 
court a quo.
</p><p>
We agree with the appellants that the lower court should not have 
considered the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength.  
This is absorbed in treachery.  Likewise, the aggravating circumstance 
of in band was not established.  There were only three who laid hands on
 the victim, namely:  Bailon Monroy and Prudencio Damiar who each fired 
with their pistol, and Porferio Damiar who stabbed him.  Thus, Prudencio
 Damiar is entitled to two mitigating circumstances of voluntary 
surrender and plea of guilty.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, appellants Prudencio Damiar and Bailon Monroy are found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, and
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (a)   Prudencio Damiar is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate 
penalty of from EIGHT (8) YEARS and TWENTY (20) DAYS of prision mayor, 
as minimum, to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, TEN (10) MONTHS and TWENTY (20) DAYS
 of reclusion temporal, as maximum; and
  </p>
  <p>
    (b)   Bailon Monroy is hereby sentenced to reclusion perpetua.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Both appellants are also sentenced to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased Alvaro Palacio, jointly and severally, in the amount of 
P30,000.00.  (People vs. de la Fuente, G.R. Nos. L-63251-52, Dec. 29, 
1983)
</p><p>
On reasonable doubt, Leoncio Licanda is hereby ACQUITTED.
SO ORDERED.
