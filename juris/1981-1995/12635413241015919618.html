				G.R. Nos. 69810-14, June 19, 1985</h4>
				<H3>TEODULO RURA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. GERVACIO A. LOPENA, PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE 2ND MUNICIPAL CIRCUIT TRIAL COURT OF TUBIGON-CLARIN, TUBIGON, BOHOL AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case involves the application of the Probation Law (P.D. No. 968, as amended), more specifically Section 9 thereof which disqualifies from probation those persons:<br><blockquote>"(c) who have previously been convicted by final judgment of an offense punished by imprisonment of not less than one month and one day and/or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos."</blockquote>Petitioner Teodulo Rura was accused, tried and convicted of five (5) counts of estafa committed on different dates in the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Tubigon-Clarin, Tubigon, Bohol, denominated as Criminal Case Nos. 523, 524, 525, 526 and 527.<br><br>The five cases were jointly tried and a single decision was rendered on August 18, 1983.&nbsp; Rura was sentenced to a total prison term of seventeen (17) months and twenty-five (25) days.&nbsp; In each criminal case the sentence was three (3) months and fifteen (15) days.<br><br>Rura appealed to the Regional Trial Court of Bohol but said court affirmed the decision of the lower court.&nbsp; When the case was remanded to the court of origin for execution of judgment, Rura applied for probation.&nbsp; The application was opposed by a probation officer of Bohol on the ground that Rura is disqualified for probation under Sec. 9 (c) of the Probation Law quoted above.&nbsp; The court denied the application for probation.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration was likewise denied.&nbsp; Hence the instant petition.<br><br>The question which is raised is whether or not the petitioner is disqualified for probation.<br><br>In denying the application for probation, the respondent judge said:<br><blockquote>"Though the five estafa cases were jointly tried and decided by the Court convicting the accused thereof, yet the dates of commission are different.&nbsp; Upon conviction, he was guilty of said offenses as of the dates of commission of the acts complained of." (<i>Rollo</i>, p. 58.)</blockquote>Upon the other hand, the petitioner argues:<br><blockquote>"We beg to disagree.&nbsp; There is no previous conviction by final judgment to speak of.&nbsp; The five (5) cases of Estafa were tried jointly and there is only one decision rendered on the same date — August 18, 1983.&nbsp; It could not be presumed that accused-petitioner had been con­victed one after the other for the five cases of Estafa because the conviction in these cases took place within the same day, August 18, 1983 by means of a Joint Decision, and not in a separate decision.<br><br>"Previous conviction, we submit, presupposes that there is a prior sentence or that there was already a decision rendered which convicted the accused.&nbsp; In this instant cases, however, there is only one decision rendered on the five (5) counts of Estafa which was promulgated on the same date.&nbsp; In other words the effects of conviction does not retract to the date of the commission of the offense as the trial court held." (Id., pp. 8-9.)</blockquote>We hold for the petitioner.&nbsp; When he applied for probation he had no previous conviction by final judgment.&nbsp; When he applied for probation the only conviction against him was the judgment which was the subject of his application.&nbsp; The statute relates "previous" to the date of conviction, not to the date of the commission of the crime.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is granted and the respondent judge is directed to give due course to the petitioner's application for probation.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Makasiar, (Chairman), Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Escolin</i>, and <i>Cuevas, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
