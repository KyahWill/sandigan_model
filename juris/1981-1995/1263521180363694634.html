Petition for <em>certiorari </em>and prohibition to annul the 
proceedings in Civil Case No. 1065-B, entitled "Feliberto V. Castillo, 
plaintiff, versus Salome M. Castillo, et al, defendants," which is 
pending before the former Court of First Instance of Bulacan, Branch IV.
<p>
Private respondent and petitioner are husband and wife.  Sometime in 
October, 1979 a complaint dated October 8, 1979 was filed by private 
respondent against petitioner for administration of conjugal properties,
 alleging that in August, 1971 petitioner took possession and 
administration of the assets of the conjugal partnership; that they were
 separated <em>de facto</em> in the latter part of 1973; and praying, 
among others, that the possession and administration of real properties 
belonging to the conjugal partnership located in the province of Bulacan
 and City of Manila be transferred to him and that the sale of a parcel 
of land and building registered in the name of the spouses made by 
petitioner be nullified.
</p><p>
Summons was issued by the respondent court.  The address of petitioner 
as alleged in the complaint and indicated in the summons is 129 or 35 
Lapu Lapu Street, Caloocan City, Metro Manila.  On October 19, 1979, 
Deputy Sheriff Felixberto L. Samonte instead of serving the summons at 
the aforesaid address, served it at No. 8 Mango Road, Malabon, Metro 
Manila, but was informed by Atty. Jose M. Castillo, a son of the 
spouses, that petitioner is not residing in said address and is 
presently in the United States of America.  When the Deputy Sheriff 
inquired the location of 129 Lapu Lapu Street, Caloocan City, Atty. 
Castillo accompanied him in said address where his brother, Feliberto M.
 Castillo, Jr. is residing.  In said address, the Deputy Sheriff was 
likewise informed that petitioner is abroad.  On October 24, 1979 the 
Castillo brothers filed a manifestation before the respondent court that
 petitioner is abroad.
</p><p>
In a letter dated December 12, 1979 private respondent requested the 
Deputy Sheriff to serve the summons at No. 8 Mango Road, Northern Hills,
 Malabon, Metro Manila.  On December 14, 1979 the Deputy Sheriff served 
the summons on the said address delivering a copy thereof to a certain 
Chua Yok, an overseer of one Ngo Kieng, who was the lessee of the 
premises belonging to the conjugal partnership of petitioner and private
 respondent.
</p><p>
For failure of petitioner to file answer, on March 24, 1980, private 
respondent filed a motion to declare the former in default which was 
granted by the trial court on April 17, 1980.  Private respondent was 
allowed to present his evidence ex-parte.  As private respondent has 
already presented his evidence and the case is pending decision before 
the lower court, the present case was instituted raising the sole 
question as to whether valid service of summons was made upon 
petitioner.  On January 11, 1981 a temporary restraining order was 
issued by this Court restraining the court <em>a quo</em> from further proceeding with the case.
</p><p>
The petition is meritorious.  There was no valid service of summons upon
 petitioner.  Courts acquire jurisdiction over the person of a party 
defendant and of the subject matter of the action by virtue of the 
service of summons in the manner required by law.  In the present case, 
petitioner is a resident temporarily out of the Philippines.  Such being
 the case, service of summons is governed by Section 18, Rule 14 of the 
Rules of Court which states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 18. - Resident temporarily out of the Philippines. - When
 an action is commenced against a defendant who ordinarily resides 
within the Philippines, but who is temporarily out of it, service may, 
by leave of court be effected out of the Philippines as under the 
preceding section."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Under Section 17, service of summons may, by leave of court, be effected
 out of the Philippines by personal service or by publication in a 
newspaper of general circulation in such places and for such time as the
 court may order, in which case a copy of the summons and order of the 
court shall be sent by registered mail to the last known address of the 
defendant.  Failure to comply with the above provisions of law, as in 
this case, is a fatal defect in the service of summons as to annul the 
proceedings taken by the lower court.  Chua Yok, a mere overseer of the 
lessee of the premises owned by the parties herein, and to whom the 
summons was served, is not in anyway authorized to receive any pleading 
in behalf of petitioner.  Hence, service of summons to him is not proper
 and legal.
</p><p>
Non-service of summons upon petitioner constitutes a deprivation of 
procedural due process.  It is fair and just that she be given her day 
in court.  It is a jurisdictional defect proper for the present 
recourse.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the proceedings in Civil Case No. 1065-D is hereby declared 
null and void.  The now Regional Trial Court, to which the case below 
has been assigned, is hereby directed to allow private respondent to 
apply for the issuance of an alias summons on petitioner, and after 
issues have been joined, to proceed to trial and judgment accordingly.  
No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos</em>, and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar</em>, J., (Chairman), joins Aquino, J., in his concurring opinion.

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
AQUINO, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
Salome Castillo of 2385 Seabright, Long Beach, California, should be 
considered already served with summons through Jose M. Castillo, the 
lawyer of his mother in this case, the son of the parties, his father's 
opponent, and a resident of 8 Mango Road, Malabon.  He should be given 
15 days from notice of the finality of the judgment in this case to 
answer the complaint in Civil Case No. 1065-D.  He should endeavor to 
settle the case amicably.
