				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Court grants the petition and as prayed for also by the Office of the 
Solicitor General, sets aside the questioned decision of May 14, 1981 of 
respondent commission which dismissed peti­tioner's appeal on the basis of a 
mere technicality (of petitioner's failure to furnish respondent-employer with a 
copy of his memo­randum of appeal), and reinstates its earlier decision of March 
10, 1981 for reinstatement of petitioner-employee to his position with 
respondent-employer. 
<p>Respondent commission's original decision of March 10, 1981 reversed the 
labor arbiter's decision of March 6, 1980 which granted respondent-employer's 
application for clearance to dismiss petitioner from his employment of about 
seven (7) years tenure as a "finisher" of furniture (for alleged "chronic 
tardiness"), solely on the basis of petitioner's alleged "wanton apathy and 
indifference to his cause" notwithstanding said labor arbiter's own finding that 
the employer's evidence "is weak and the facts of the case do not justify 
dismissal." Respondent commission ordered respondent-employer "to reinstate 
oppositor to his former or substantially equivalent position without backwages 
within ten (10) days from re­ceipt of this Decision," ruling as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The appeal is grounded on 1) grave abuse of discretion and 2) the decision 
is not supported by law and evidence.&nbsp; In arguing his case, oppositor alleges 
that the Labor Arbiter below erred in granting the clearance to terminate his 
services solely on alleged indifference and wanton apathy attendant in the 
pro­secution of his case.&nbsp; Oppositor maintains that his failure to attend the 
hearings was due to the negligence of the counsel provided by the Union; that in 
several occasions he waited for a long time to talk to his counsel but to no 
avail; that he was not informed of the scheduled hearings; and that it is unfair 
to grant the clearance to terminate oppositor's services because of the failure 
of the counsel to attend the hear­ings. </p>
<p>"We have gone carefully over the records of this case and we rule for the 
reversal of the deci­sion appealed from. </p>
<p>"We quote hereunder the uncontroverted find­ings of the Labor Arbiter below, 
and consider the same as our own: </p>
<p>'We find Luis Estrada's tardiness not a sufficient cause for dismissal.&nbsp; He 
was only late or tardy for six (6) times on May 5 and 15, 1979; on June 5, 26, 
27 and June 30, 1979.&nbsp; Certainly such tardi­ness is not chronic and on the 
hypothesis that it is chronic, the same does not merit the supreme penalty of 
dismissal consider­ing that Estrada has been in the service for 7 years.' 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed we rule that the penalty of dismissal for the tardiness committed is 
too harsh.&nbsp; We find suspen­sion a more appropriate penalty considering the facts 
attendant to this case and we vote for reinstatement without backwages, the 
period by which oppositor is out of service be considered as penalty of 
suspen­sion for his tardiness. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, decision appealed from is here­by Reversed and the application 
for clearance Denied." </p></blockquote>
<p>On respondent-employer's motion for reconsideration, how­ever, respondent 
commission rendered another decision under date of May 14, 1981 (setting aside 
its original decision of March 10, 1981 for petitioner's reinstatement) and 
without discussing the merits of the case, it sustained the sole ground of 
procedural technicality raised of the employer's not having been furnished with 
copy of petitioner's memorandum of appeal (contrary to the requirements of 
Article 223 of the New Labor Code and section 9, Rule XIII of its implementing 
Rules and Regulations) and dismissed petitioner's appeal "for failure to meet 
the requirement of a per­fected appeal" - notwithstanding the commission's own 
finding of the lack of sufficient cause to justify petitioner's dismissal from 
employment in its original decision of March 10, 1981. </p>
<p>We find the Solicitor General's stand in their comment to be well-taken and 
in accordance with the constitutional injunc­tion to afford protection to labor 
and the workers' right of security of tenure,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Considering that there is no basis for the dismissal of petitioner, it would 
be inconsistent with the requirement of social justice to terminate his 
employment on mere grounds of technicality. </p>
<p>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x </p></blockquote>
<p>Neither can private respondent validly complain that it has been denied its 
right to due process by having been allegedly deprived of the opportunity to 
answer petitioner's appeal on account of the lat­ter's failure to furnish the 
former with a copy of his memorandum of appeal.&nbsp; Since the entire re­cord of the 
case on appeal is open for review by the NLRC, the absence of an answer or 
opposition to the appeal would not really have a significant bearing on the 
adjudication of the case, as would otherwise perhaps constitute a denial of 
private respondent's right to due process.&nbsp; Besides, private respondent had 
already the opportunity to an­swer petitioner's appeal when he filed a motion 
for reconsideration of the earlier decision of the NLRC.&nbsp; Significantly, 
however, said respondent never touched on the merits of the case in his 
aforementioned motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Instead, it relied solely on 
technicality to oppose petitioner's appeal which thereby reasonably creates the 
impression that its case is weak as in fact it is."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>As stated by the Chief Justice for the Court in Meracap vs. International 
Ceramics Mfg. Co., Inc., "for the strictly juridical standpoint, it cannot be 
too strongly stressed, to follow Davis in his masterly work, Discretionary 
Justice, that where a decision may be made to rest on informed judgment rather 
than rigid rules, all the equities of the case must be accorded their due 
weight.&nbsp; Finally, labor law determinations, to quote from Bultmann, should be 
not only secundum rationem but also secundum caritatem."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
<p>In Phil. Blooming Mills Employees Organization vs. Phil. Blooming Mills Co., 
Inc.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> the Court through Mr. Justice 
Maka­siar stressed the dominance and superiority of constitutional rights over 
statutes and subordinate implementing rules and regulations, thus:&nbsp; ''(D)oes the 
mere fact that the motion for reconsideration was filed two (2) days late defeat 
the rights of the petitioning em­ployees?&nbsp; Or more directly and concretely, does 
the inadvertent omission to comply with a mere Court of Industrial Relations 
procedural rule governing the period for filing a motion for reconsideration or 
appeal in labor cases, promulgated pursuant to a legislative delegation, prevail 
over constitutional rights?&nbsp; The answer should be obvious in the light of the 
aforecited cases.&nbsp; To accord supremacy to the foregoing rules of the Court of 
Industrial Relations over basic human rights sheltered by the Constitution, is 
not only incompatible with the basic tenet of constitutional government that the 
Constitution is superior to any statute or subordinate rules and regulations, 
but also does violence to natural reason and logic." </p>
<p>Respondent commission's original decision of March 10, 1981, which is hereby 
reinstated as the correct decision, ordered the reinstatement within ten (10) 
days of petitioner to his former position without backwages, with the said 
period (of almost two years from June 11, 1979 to March 10, 1981) when he was 
out of employment considered as penalty for his tardiness." Even this penalty of 
suspension may be considered as quite harsh, amounting to several months pay 
lost per day that petitioner was tardy.&nbsp; Petitioner, at the very least, should 
therefore be entitled to backwages from the date of promulgation of said 
decision on March 10, 1981 until his actual reinstatement. </p>
<strong>ACCORDINGLY</strong>, respondent commission's decision of May 14, 
1981 is hereby set aside and its earlier decision of March 10, 1981 is hereby 
rein­stated and affirmed, with the clarification that respondent-employer is 
ordered to reinstate peti­tioner to his former or substantially equivalent 
position without loss of seniority and other privi­leges within ten (10) days 
from notice hereof and to pay petitioner backwages from March 10, 1981 until his 
actual reinstatement.&nbsp; This decision is immediately executory.&nbsp;
