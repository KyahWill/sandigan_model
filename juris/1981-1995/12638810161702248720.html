<blockquote>For the prosecution <span class="SpellE">Conrada</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span> testified that on July 2, 1973, at about 3:00 o'clock
in the afternoon while she was at home in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Libacao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, lying down
and feeding her baby, the appellant came to the house and asked her where
husband <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span> was
and she informed him that he was not around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant then went inside the room, sat on the bed and held the face of
her baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this the appellant held
her nipple and she brushed his arm aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He held both of <span style="">her shoulders
and pinned her down placing himself on her top.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant <span class="SpellE">unzippered</span> his pants and had his
penis out and he raised her dress (duster) up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She boxed him with her two hands and brushed him aside and she shouted,
as he raised her dress, coupled with a blow on his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she shouted twice he took the pillow and
covered her mouth and he did a push and pull movement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She struggled </span>hard to stand up and the
penis of the appellant was not able to penetrate her vagina because she was
struggling although it was touching her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant knelt on her thigh and pinned down the pillow that was
covering her mouth so she lost consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And when she regained consciousness the appellant <span style="">was </span>still doing the push and pull
movement and his penis was able to penetrate her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at that moment when <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> <span class="SpellE">Icutan</span> arrived who asked
(sic) her what happened to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> was already climbing the ladder the appellant
immediately stood up and jumped out of the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> went
inside the room and she looked <span style="">outside
the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked the complainant </span>why
she was crying and complainant told her that she was forced by the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon her husband arrived and then
she told him that she was forced by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband looked for the appellant around
the house and when he failed to find the appellant he reported the matter to
the Barrio Captain the following day (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1975</st1:date>, pp. 35-43).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The complainant is corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Icutan</span> who stated that at around 3:00 o'clock of July
2, 1973 while she was at the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>, about 50 arms stretch from the house of <span class="SpellE">Conrada</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span>, she heard a baby
crying so she went up to <span class="SpellE">Sabay's</span> house but upon
reaching the stairs she saw <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span> peeping at one side of the house out of the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the appellant jumped out she
scolded him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked the complainant
why she was crying and complainant told her that she was forced by the
appellant by being made to lie down the (sic) floor with her face upward, her
mouth was pinned with a pillow, and her two shoulders were pinned down on the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant <span style="">also </span>told her that appellant was able
to abuse her and she was even warned to keep quiet otherwise she will be in
danger (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="6">June
 27, 1974</st1:date>, pp. 2-5).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span>
also testified that on that fateful day, he went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Conrada</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span> at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>, when he heard then complainant crying and so he
went to the corner of the house and peeped and he saw the appellant on top of
the complainant who was continuously boxing him as he did the push and pull
movement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Icutan</span>, the mother-in-law of the complainant, arrived
who (sic) asked <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> why he was there and he told
her to go up and see what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> went up, the appellant jumped out of the house
through the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pulled up his
trousers, and ran away towards his home <span style="">down
the stream which is over one (1) kilometer away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this incident he went to the place
where the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> thatches are which he bought from <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span> which he tied and brought home (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
</span><st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="2"><span style="">Feb. 4, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">,
pp. 2-5).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand the appellant testifying in his defense, stated
that on <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1973</st1:date>, at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon
he went to the house of the complainant to inquire about the status of the mountain
land he acquired from <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span>,
<span style="">husband of the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land was verbally sold to him in 1967 for
P200.00 after which he possessed the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As there was no document covering the sale he went to their house to ask
that it be documented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therein he found
the offended party and <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> <span class="SpellE">Icutan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seated (sic) on the bench of the balcony
of the house staying there for about half an hour to wait for <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span>, as the offended
party told him that her husband was at his </span>work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied having sexual intercourse with the
offended party much less that he was armed at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the incident, that is on <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1973</st1:date> he went to see <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span> when he talked to
him about the proposed instrument covering the sale of the land but <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> was not agreeable and was even angry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he file (sic) a complaint with the <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> PC Provincial Command on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span> testified against him because one Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> mortgaged a land to him and he drove out <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span> as <span style="">overseer of said </span><span style="">land </span><span style="">because he was abusing it by cutting down the coconut trees and
palms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage of the land is shown
by letters he sent to the late Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 6 &amp; 7).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The consideration of the mortgage was P1,200.00 (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
</span><st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="9"><span style="">Sept. 13, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">,
</span>pp. 68-76).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant argues that as the offended <span style="">part</span>y<span style=""> </span>failed to
submit herself to medical examination thus the prosecution failed to establish
the alleged sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it
to state here that the offended party and her husband are simple and uneducated
people who are not expected <span style="">to </span>know
<span style="">the </span><span style="">evidentiary value of such a medical examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., </span><st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="4"><span style="">April 3,
 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, p. 60) As a
matter of fact when they learned of the need for such an examination, on July
6, 1975 she went to the <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> Provincial Hospital for
the purpose, but due to the length of time that elapsed, no sign of sexual
intercourse of (sic) force inflicted could be found (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
</span>March 1, 1975, p. 21).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless such a medical examination of the victim is not <span style="">indispensable in a prosecution for rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Selfaison</span>,
1 SCRA 235, 242, it was held --<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘In fact, it is not even necessary that there be a medical
examination of the victim in cases of rape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether <span style="">or </span>not the charge
will prosper depends upon the evidence offered and so long as such evidence
convinces the court, a conviction for rape is proper.’</p>

<blockquote>The appellant's theory is that, even assuming he had sexual
intercourse with the offended party, it was committed by appellant with her
consent, citing paragraph 4 of the sworn statement of the offended party of
July 20, 1973 before the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Libacao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far supporting the theory of appellant, said
portion of the statement show (sic) that the appellant tried to force his
attention on the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she
resisted, he placed a pillow over her mouth and pressed her by the shoulder
placing himself on her top by pressing down her two legs and inserting his
penis in her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in <span style="">the </span>other portions of the same
statement the offended party stated that the appellant even threatened her to
keep quiet or something will happen to her and that she could not shout because
<span style="">her </span>mouth was covered with a
pillow (pars. 5 &amp; 8, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that at the time the appellant went inside the
room of the offended party she was breast feeding her baby she must have put
down the baby to resist the advances <span style="">of
the appellant who started to touch her nipple and not as surmised by the
appellant that </span>she <span style="">voluntarily
put aside her baby at the moment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The appellant also pointed out alleged material contradictions
between the testimony of the offended party and her sworn statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in her sworn statement she never alleged
she lost consciousness in her testimony she stated otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The omission of this fact in her sworn
statement does not detract from the fact that she actually lost consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that affidavits, being <u>ex</u>
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">are
almost always incomplete and often inaccurate (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacala</span>,
58 SCRA 370; People v. <span class="SpellE">Jovellano</span>, 56 SCRA 156).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Another alleged contradiction is that while the complainant
testified she shouted twice in her sworn statement she said she was not able to
shout as her mouth was covered with a pillow there is no contradiction in this
aspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that she shouted
so <span style="">the appellant covered her mouth with
a pillow when (sic) obviously she could not shout anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At any rate, the issue boils down to the matter of credibility of
witnesses and the traditional rule <span style="">is </span>that
it is the province of <span style="">the trial court
to determine the credibility of witnesses because of its superior advantage of
observing the conduct and demeanor of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the witnesses while
testifying on the witness stand, and that on appeal its findings shall not be
disturbed unless some fact or circumstance may have been overlooked that may
otherwise affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court in this
issue.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>However, the penalty imposed by the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>is incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
prosecution has established that the crime of rape has been committed then the
imposable penalty shall be <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> </span><span style="">in accordance with Article 335 of the Revised
Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 2, of Act 4103
as amended by Act 4225, known </span>as <span style="">the
Indeterminate Sentence Law, the said law shall not apply to persons convicted
of offenses punished by death or life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code,
it provided </span>as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘ART.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>63.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Rules</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>application</u>
<u>of</u> <u>indivisible</u> <u>penalties</u>. - In all cases in which the law
prescribes a single indivisible penalty, it shall be applied by the courts
regardless <span style="">any mitigating or

and irreparable injustice would be inflicted upon hapless victims of the most
detestable crime committed in remote areas of the country where no doctors who
could conduct the medical examination immediately after the commission of the
crime would be available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not
likewise unmindful of </span>the <span style="">fact
that it is with the utmost reluctance that a victim of rape submits herself to
a medical examination immediately after the commission of the crime for, in
many instances, what pre-occupies her mind is not the filing of a complaint but
rather the fear of what the assailant would further inflict upon her by a
revelation of her harrowing experience, or the embarrassment and humiliation
that a trial would visit upon her as she publicly bares the ignominy undergone
which would forever affect her honor and reputation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second assigned error
in the Supplemental Brief is a delayed after-thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his main brief, appellant did not even
intimate that the trial court erred in not sustaining the defense claim of
sufficient motive on the part of the </span>complainant to concoct the
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis for this claim is <span style="">the alleged land dispute between appellant
and the family of the <span class="SpellE">Sabays</span> which, according to the
former, "was more than sufficient </span>motive on the part of the <span class="SpellE">Sabays</span> to concoct this charge." The testimony of the
appellant both on direct examination<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>

fails even to remotely suggest such a conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as correctly ruled by the trial
court:<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> While
the Court finds that there exists bad blood between the accused and <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span>, to the mind of the
Court such a circumstance could not give rise to a fabrication of the charge of
rape in which the person of the offended party, her honor and good name would
be subject to ridicule and contempt by the people who might hear her having
been ravished by another man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And much
more, a husband in his right senses would hardly allow that to happen to his
wife.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The differences existing between the accused and <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span> was (sic)
nevertheless settled at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Martelino</span></st1:placename></st1:place> by the Philippine
Constabulary authorities to (sic) whom the accused, the records show, had filed
a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span>
after a complaint of rape was filed against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabay</span> had paid the accused, it was a pure
indebtedness."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The suggestion of
appellant that complainant was used by her husband to exact vengeance on
appellant is entirely unacceptable, not only because it is pure speculation, but
also because it is so unnatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
makes a mockery of the sanctity of the relationship of husband and wife in an
inviolable social institution, the Filipino family, and of the traditional high
regard and respect the Filipino male has for his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, and in relation
to the third assigned error in the Supplemental Brief, the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Agrifina</span> <span class="SpellE">Icutan</span> were
not indispensable to prove the commission of the crime of rape in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, their testimonies may
even be disregarded, for the testimony of the complainant is sufficient enough
to produce conviction in an unprejudiced mind.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We finally rule that the
award of moral damages, which neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals
granted, </span>is <span style="">in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape necessarily brings to the victim mental
anguish, </span>fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, moral shock,

award to the complainant the sum of P30,000.00 as moral damages.</p>
