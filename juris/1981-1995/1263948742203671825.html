				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Fernando Clavo, Jr. appeals from the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XVIII in Criminal Case No. 84-30346, the dispositive portion of which is as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the accused Fernando Clavo, Jr. y Baldosa is hereby declared guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having violated Sec. 4, Article II of Republic Act 6425, as amended in relation to Sec. 2(1), Art. I thereof by selling dried marijuana flowering tops. He is accordingly sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P20,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.<br><br>“The two tea bags containing marijuana flowering tops presented as evidence in this case are hereby ordered sent to the Dangerous Drugs Board for its proper destruction and disposition.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>(p. 4, Decision; p. 65, <i>Rollo</i>)<br><br>on the following assignments of error:<br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION AND IN DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE; AND<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME AS CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION. (Brief for the Accused-Appellant, p. 54, Rollo)</blockquote>The facts established by the prosecution are summarized in the People's Brief, to wit:<br><blockquote>“About a month prior to September 25, 1984 Patrolmen Wilfredo S. Ortega, Florentino Angelo, Jr., and Noel Viscarra, all members of the Western Police District (WPD), Manila assigned to the Drug Enforcement Section, conducted a surveillance in the vicinity of the house located at No. 1344 G. Tuazon, Sampaloc, Manila, regarding the illegal sale of marijuana (p. 2, TSN, December 5, 1984). As a result of this surveillance, they came to know that the suppliers of marijuana along G. Tuazon, Sampaloc, Manila, were a certain Alex, appellant Fernando Clavo, Jr., and one whose name they did not know (p. 4, TSN, December 5, 1984).<br><br>"On September 25, 1984 at around 12:30 p.m., they conducted a buy bust operation (P. 4, TSN, December 21, 1984). As planned, Patrolman Ortega would pose as buyer of marijuana and on signal of Patrolman Ortega, Patrolmen Angelo, Jr. and Viscarra would frisk and apprehend appellant. On that particular date and time, Patrolman Ortega pretended to be a student carrying notebooks. He had a long mustache and wore faded maong (p. 3, TSN, December 5, 1984). He was standing in front of house No. 1344, Tuazon St., Sampaloc, Manila and was convincing appellant to sell to him marijuana. Patrolman Ortega gave to appellant two (2) ten-peso bills, which were previously marked with initials by Patrolmen Ortega and Viscarra. Apellant left and went across the street. After about three or four minutes, appellant came back, and handed two tea bags of marijuana to Patrolman Ortega. Upon signal of Patrolman Ortega, appellant was accosted and apprehended by Patrolmen Angelo, Jr. and Viscarra. Patrolman Ortega helped in the apprehension of appellant (p. 6, TSN, December 5, 1984). The marked two ten-peso bills were confiscated from appellant by Patrolman Angelo, Jr. (P. 13, TSN, December 21, 1984).<br><br>“After appellant was apprehended he was brought to the police station for investigation. Appellant was investigated by Patrolman Viscarra. Appellant verbally admitted that he handed marijuana to Patrolman Ortega who posed as a buyer. Patrolman Viscarra asked appellant where the marijuana came from. Appellant replied that it came from a certain place in Forbes known as “Lungga”. Patrolman Viscarra prepared the Crime Report and the Booking and Information Sheet of appellant (pp. 18-21, TSN, December 21, 1984).<br><br>“On September 25, 1984 about 2:30 p.m. Leonora Vallado, a Supervising Forensic Chemist of the National Bureau of Investigation received from Patrolman Viscarra dried pieces of marijuana or dried marijuana flowering tops contained in a sealed plastic bag with rolling papers with marking together with an official letter-request (p. 4, TSN, November 26, 1984). She subjected the specimen to microscopic and chemical examination and she found that the flowering tops are positive for marijuana (p. 5, TSN, November 26, 1984; Exh. “B”). She also conducted a chromatographic examination and found the specimen positive for marijuana (p. 6, TSN, November 26, 1984; Exh. “C”).” (pp. 2-5, Brief for the Appellee; pp. 78-81, <i>Rollo</i>)</blockquote>Consequently, Fernando Clavo, Jr. was charged with the serious crime of drug pushing as defined and penalized under Sec. 4, Art. II in relation to Section 2 (1) of Article I of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, otherwise known as Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, in an Information which reads:<br><blockquote>“That on or about September 25, 1984 in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, deliver, give away to another or distribute any prohibited drug, did then and there willfully and unlawfully sell or offer for sale dried marijuana flowering tops and rolling papers contained in two (2) sealed teabags, which is a prohibited drug.” (p. 1, Brief for the Appellee; p. 77, <i>Rollo</i>)</blockquote>Appellant pleaded not guilty when arraigned. But as against the foregoing evidence of the prosecution, appellant had only his own uncorroborated testimony denying the damaging testimonies of the three (3) policemen. He claimed that he was only resting inside an abandoned vehicle baside a junk shop after he had sold and delivered empty bottles to his buyer and capitalist, when one of the policeman in plain clothes approached him and asked him if he knew a certain Alex.<br><br>According to appellant, he told the man that he knew Alex. Then he was asked by the man to accompany him to Alex. He, however, refused because he was tired. Instead, he just pointed to the man the house of Alex which was at No. 1317 G. Tuazon. The man then left.<br><br>A short while later this man returned with two other men and they arrested him and brought him to their jeep parked some distance away. There he saw Pat. Angelo and Viscarra seated inside the owner-type jeep. He was then brought to the Police headquarters where he was further investigated.<br><br>When he was asked what could be the reason why these three policemen would be falsely implicating him as a pusher he said that it was because he had refused to help them arrest Alex. He disclosed that five days after his arrest the police authorities succeeded in arresting Alex and he has been charged accordingly.<br><br>The appellant also gave as a possible reason why the policemen arrested him the fact that he had tattoos. When he explained to them that these tattoos had been acquired by him during his incarceration at Sablayan Penal Colony and showed to them his parole papers, the policemen still insisted on arresting him and later charging him as a pusher (p. 64, <i>Rollo</i>).<br><br>In its now assailed Decision the trial court ruled:<br><blockquote>“The resolution of this case hinges principally on a question of credibility. This Court finds no sufficient reason to discredit the testimonies of the three policemen who arrested the accused immediately after he sold to one of them the two tea bags containing marijuana. This Court is not convinced by the claim of the accused that the reason why he was implicated by these policemen is simply because he refused to help them arrest Alex and because he had tattoos.” (Decision, pp. 3-4, <i>Rollo,</i> pp. 64-65).</blockquote>We affirm the conviction. The findings of the trial court are in accord with law and substantiated by the evidence and therefore deserve to be upheld.<br><br>Prosecution witness Patrolman Wilfredo S.

Patrolman Ortega's testimony was corroborated on material points by the testimonies of Patrolmen Angelo and Viscarra. The testimonies of these prosecution witnesses have clearly established appellant's culpability. It has not been shown that they had any improper motive to testify falsely against appellant. They testified as they did merely in compliance with their duty as enforcers of the law (<i>People v. Eslabon,</i> 145 SCRA 396). As stated in <i>People v. Patog,</i> (G.R. No. 69620, September 24, 1986):<br><blockquote>“Where there is no evidence and nothing to indicate that the principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit.” See also <i>People v. Campana,</i> 124 SCRA 271, <i>People v. de Jesus,</i> 145 SCRA 521).</blockquote>On the other hand, the defense offered by appellant is clearly concocted and deserves no credence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from being in accord with law and the evidence, the same is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Melencio-Herrera, (Chairman), Padilla, Sarmiento,</i> and <i>Regalado, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
