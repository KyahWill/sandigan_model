				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Through this Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Philippine National
Oil Company-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) seeks to declare null and
void, for lack of jurisdiction, the Order of public respondent, the Deputy
Minister of Labor, sustaining <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">his </span>jurisdiction
over the instant controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner PNOC-EDC is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>subsidiary
of the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="1">20 January 1978</st1:date>,
it filed with the Ministry of Labor and Employment, Regional Office No. VII, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City (MOLE), a clearance application to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">dismiss/terminate the services of private
respondent, Vicente D. <span class="SpellE">Ellelina</span>, a contractual
employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The application for
clearance </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">premised on <span class="SpellE">Ellelina's</span>
alleged commission of a crime (Alarm or Public Scandal) during a Christmas
party on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">19 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">December 1977 at petitioner’s camp in <span class="SpellE">Uling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, when, because of the
refusal of the raffle committee to give him the prize corresponding to his lost
winning ticket, he tried to grab the <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifle
of the PC Officer outside the building despite the warning shots fired by the
latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Clearance to dismiss was
initially granted by MOLE but was subsequently revoked and petitioner was
ordered to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Ellelina</span> to his former position,
without loss of seniority rights, and with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from </span><st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 13.0pt">1 February 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
up to his actual reinstatement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner appealed to
the Minister of Labor who, acting through public respondent, affirmed, on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">14
 August 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the
appealed Order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this Petition
predicated substantially </span>on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">following
grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 277 of the
Labor Code, the Ministry of Labor and Employment has no jurisdiction over
petitioner because it is a government-owned or controlled corporation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ellelina's</span>
dismissal is valid and just because it is based upon the commission of a crime.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, public respondent contends:</p>

<blockquote>(a) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>While the petitioner is
a subsidiary of the PNOC, it is still covered by the Labor Code and, therefore,
within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor inasmuch as petitioner was
organized as a private corporation under the Corporation Law and registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from assailing the Labor Department's
jurisdiction, having subjected itself to the latter when it filed the
application for clearance to terminate <span class="SpellE">Ellelina's</span>
services; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Dismissal is too harsh a
penalty.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The issues that confront
us, therefore, are (1) whether or not public respondent committed grave abuse
of discretion in holding that petitioner is governed by the Labor Code; and (2)
whether or not <span class="SpellE">Ellelina's</span> dismissal was justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Under the laws then in
force, employees of government-owned and/or controlled corporations were
governed by the Civil Service Law and not by the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Article 277 of the Labor
Code (PD 442) then provided:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The terms and conditions of employment of all government
employees, including employees of government-owned and controlled corporations
shall be governed by the Civil Service Law, rules and regulations x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In turn, the 1973
Constitution provided:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Civil Service embraces every branch, agency, subdivision
and instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled
corporations."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In National Housing
Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Juco</span> (L-64313, January 17, 1985, 134
SCRA 172), we laid down the doctrine that employees of government-owned and/or
controlled corporations, whether created by special </span>law o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">r formed as subsidiaries under the general
Corporation Law, are governed by the Civil Service Law and not by the Labor
Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">However, the above
doctrine has been supplanted by the present Constitution, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The Civil Service embraces all branches, subdivisions,
instrumentalities and agencies of the Government, including government–owned or
controlled corporations with original charters." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(Article IX–B, Section 2 (1))<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Thus, under the present
state of the law, the test in determining whether </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">government–owned or controlled corporation is subject to the Civil
Service Law is the manner of its creation such that government corporations created
by special charter are subject to its provisions while those incorporated under
the general Corporation Law are not within its coverage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In NASECO vs. NLRC (G.R.
No. 69870, November 29, 1988), we had occasion to apply the present Constitution
in deciding whether or not the employees of NASECO (a subsidiary of the NIDC,
which is in turn a subsidiary wholly–owned by the PNB, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">government–owned corporation) are covered by the Civil Service Law or
the Labor Code notwithstanding that the case arose at the time when the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1973 Constitution was still </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We held that the NLRC has jurisdiction over the employees of NASECO
"on the premise that it is the 1987 Constitution that governs because it
is the Constitution in place at the time of decision;" and that being a
corporation without an original charter, the employees of NASECO are subject to
the provisions of the Labor Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We see no reason to
depart from the ruling in the aforesaid case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We hold, therefore, that
the PNOC-EDC, having been incorporated under the general Corporation Law, is a
government-owned or controlled corporation whose employees are subject to the
provisions of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
apparently the intendment in the NASECO case notwithstanding the fact that the
NASECO therein was a subsidiary of the PNB, </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">government-owned corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In so far as <span class="SpellE">Ellelina</span> is concerned, we hold that the reinstatement
ordered by public respondent, without loss </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">seniority rights, is
proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, consistent with the
rulings of this Court, <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be limited to
three years from </span><st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1 February 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
dismissal ordered by petitioner was a bit too harsh considering the nature of
the act which he had committed and that it was his first offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the Petition is DISMISSED, and the judgment
of </span>respondent public official is hereby AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style:italic"><span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,
<span style="font-style:normal">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style:normal">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
