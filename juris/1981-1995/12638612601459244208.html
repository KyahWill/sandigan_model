his employees and to decide when to engage them as protected under our
Constitution, and the same can only be restricted by law through the exercise of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Moreover, in the

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is clear that petitioner has no liability

the agreement that petitioner has no commitment or duty to absorb them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the court does not subscribe to the theory of public
respondent that petitioner should have informed NUWHRAIN of its lease of the
premises and its purchase of the assets and personal properties of <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span> therein so that said employees could have taken
steps to protect their interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
