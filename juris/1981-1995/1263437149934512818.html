				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">ORLANDO FRAGO was charged before the court <i>a quo </i>with rape
and attempted rape, docketed as Crim. Cases Nos. 9144 and 9145, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Crim. Case No. 9144, the Information states that in the early
morning of 26 September 1990, at about four o'clock, in the <i><span style="">poblacion </span></i>of Quezon, Palawan, the
accused Orlando Frago -</p>

<blockquote>x x x entered the sleeping room of the
house belonging to Fortunato Moral where JICELYN LANSAP was sleeping, thereby
Jicelyn Lansap was bodily carried by accused Orlando Frago to a nearby house
belonging to Dado Andor and with lewd design did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously lay with and have carnal knowledge with said Jicelyn
Lansap who at that time was deeply asleep, against her will and without her
consent, to the damage and prejudice of Jicelyn Lansap.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Crim. Case No. 9145, the Information alleges that in the early
morning of 26 September 1990, at about three forty-five, in the <i><span style="">poblacion </span></i>of Quezon, Palawan, the
accused Orlando Frago -</p>

<blockquote>x x x entered the <span style="">room of the </span>dwelling house of Philip Pastera where one RONALYN
PASTERA, a girl 9 years of age, was sleeping, and once inside the room, with
lewd design did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously hold her
head and bodily carry said Ronalyn Pastera, thus commencing the commission of a
felony of Rape directly by overt acts but did not perform all the acts of
execution which would produce the said felony by reason of causes other than
the spontaneous desistance of the accused, that is, Ronalyn Pastera was
awakened and shouted for help, thus forcing the accused to release Ronalyn
Pastera and ran away.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 1 October 1991, after trial, the court <i>a quo </i>rendered
its decision finding the accused guilty of rape in Crim. Case No. 9144 and
sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>with the accessory penalties of
civil interdiction for life and perpetual absolute disqualification, to pay
Jicelyn Lansap P30,000.00 for moral damages, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Crim. Case No. 9145 for attempted rape, the accused was
acquitted on "reasonable doubt occasioned by lack of clear and convincing
evidence that the accused Orlando Frago indeed performed against Ronalyn
Pastera overt acts constituting commencement of the commission of the crime of rape."</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the acquittal of the accused in Crim. Case No. 9145,
we are here called upon to review only his conviction in Crim. Case No. 9144
for rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">In holding appellant liable for rape, the trial court based its
decision mainly on its finding that the accused was positively identified by
his victim, complaining witness Jicelyn Lansap, and that there was no ill
motive on her part to testify against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jicelyn Lansap, a 15-year old high school student, was boarding
in the house of one Fausto Morales in the <i><span style="">poblacion </span></i>together with her cousins Susan and Adea
Bansil.  The version of the prosecution
is that before proceeding to the boarding house of Jicelyn Lansap, the accused,
an ice cream vendor, first went to the residence of Ronalyn Pastera at around
three forty-five in the morning and surreptitiously entered Ronalyn's bedroom
where she was sleeping.  He fanned her
face with his handkerchief and then lifted her bodily from the floor.  He was about to take her out of the room
when she suddenly woke up and screamed for help thus prompting her father to
respond immediately by switching on the lights.  As a consequence, the accused had to drop Ronalyn on the floor
and run out of the house.  The
prosecution would seem to infer that from the house of Ronalyn where he failed
in his alleged attempt to defile her, the accused next went to the boarding
house of Jicelyn some fifty meters away.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Jicelyn, she and her cousins went to bed at about
eight o'clock in the evening of 25 September 1990.  Then at around five-thirty the following morning, she was
awakened by appellant who was already strangling her.  She shouted for help so that he immediately ran away.  She felt pain all over her body, more
particularly in her private part, and discovered that she was no longer wearing
her skirt and underwear.  To her
consternation, she found herself in the vacant house of a certain Dado
Andor.  So she lost no time looking for
her way home.  Upon reaching her
boarding house, she narrated her harrowing experience to her cousins who in
turn related the incident to her mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">At eight o'clock that morning, Jicelyn and her mother went to the
hospital where she was examined by Dr. Marcela Remegio who found Jicelyn with
"Labia Majora and Minora still coaptated and with sign of external
struggle x x x contusion, abrasion all over face x x x around neck x x x
scratch marks on both medial surface of thigh x x x vulva swollen x x x
presence of fresh hymenal laceration at six o'clock x x x [e]xamination for the
presence of spermatozoa was positive x x x physical virginity lost."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, Ronalyn's father and Jicelyn reported the
incidents to the police authorities.  Both Ronalyn and Jicelyn identified the accused as their attacker in the
police line-up on 28 September and 8 October 1990, respectively, and then filed
their formal complaints against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, appellant seeks sanctuary in the alcove of denial
and alibi.  He claims that at nine
o'clock in the evening of 25 September 1990, he was already asleep with his
wife and children.  He woke up at six
o'clock the following morning.  He was
very tired that night because he was vending ice cream in the <i>poblacion</i>
the whole day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal, appellant imputes error to the trial court in
convicting him on the basis of an identification which was made without the
assistance of counsel and according credence to the story of Jicelyn, which he
considers fantastic, thereby denying his constitutional right to be presumed
innocent until proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that it was during his detention, when he was
not assisted by counsel, that he was identified by Jicelyn.  Thus he invokes People v. Hassan<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court affirmed the right of an accused to counsel at all stages of
the proceedings, the most crucial of which is his identification, and denial
thereof entitles him to acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot sustain the argument.  We quote hereunder the pertinent portions constituting the <i>ratio
decidendi </i>in the Hassan case -</p>

<blockquote>x x x x The manner by which Jose Samson, Jr., was made to confront
and identify the accused alone at the funeral parlor, without being placed in a
police line-up, was 'pointedly suggestive, generated confidence where there was
none, activated visual imagination, and, all told, subverted his reliability as
eyewitness.  This unusual, coarse and
highly singular method of identification, which revolts against the accepted
principles of scientific crime detection, alienates the esteem of every just man,
and commands neither our respect nor acceptance' (citing People v. Cruz, No.
L-24424, 30 March 1970, 32 SCRA 181, 186; People v. Olvis, et al., G.R. No.
71092, 30 September 1987; Chavez v. Court of Appeals, No. L-29169, 24 SCRA 663,
679).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, the confrontation arranged by the police investigator
between the self-proclaimed eyewitness and the accused did violence to the
right of the latter to counsel in all stages of the investigation into the
commission of a crime especially at its most crucial stage - the identification
of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the infringement of the constitutional protection to the
rights of the accused should result in the acquittal of the accused in proper
cases as a matter of course, appellant's reliance on <i><span style="">Hassan</span></i><span style=""> </span>is
misplaced and shows a deficient comprehension of our rationalization
therein.  We acquitted the accused in
that case because, among other things, of its peculiar factual milieu.  There was no line-up of suspects.  There was only the accused.  Thus, we observed:</p>

<blockquote>As it turned out, the method of identification became just a <u>confrontation</u>.  At that critical and decisive moment, the
scales of justice tipped unevenly against the young, poor, and disadvantaged
accused.  The police procedure adopted
in this case in which <u>only the accused was presented to witness Samson, in
the funeral parlor, and in the presence of the grieving relatives of the
victim, is as tainted as an uncounselled confession</u> x x x x (underscoring
supplied)<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, Orlando Frago was singled out by Jicelyn in a police
line-up composed of ten persons.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Some
were stout while others were slim, but almost all of them were mustachioed and
five were long-haired.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> In
Gamboa v. Cruz,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
we were explicit -</p>

<blockquote>The right to counsel attaches upon the start of an investigation,
i.e., when the investigating officer starts to ask questions to elicit
information and/or confessions or admissions from the respondent/accused.  At such point or stage, the person being
interrogated must be assisted by counsel to avoid the pernicious practice of
extorting false or coerced admissions or confessions from the lips of the
person undergoing interrogation, for the commission of an offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Any person under investigation must, among other things, be
assisted by counsel.  The above-cited
provisions of the Constitution are clear.   They leave no room for equivocation.  Accordingly, in several cases, this Court has consistently held
that no custodial investigation shall be conducted unless it be in the presence
of counsel, engaged by the person arrested, or by any person in his behalf, or
appointed by the court upon petition either of the detainee himself, or by
anyone in his behalf, and that, while the right may be waived, the waiver shall
not be valid unless made in writing and in the presence of counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As aptly observed, however, by the Solicitor General, <u>the police
line-up (at least, in this case) was not part of the custodial inquest, hence,
petitioner was not yet entitled, at such stage, to counsel</u>.  The Solicitor General states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">When petitioner was identified by the complainant at the police
line-up, he had not been held yet to answer for a criminal offense.  The police line-up is not a part of the
custodial inquest, hence, he was not yet entitled to counsel.  Thus, it was held that when the process had
not yet shifted from the investigatory to the accusatory as when police
investigation does not elicit a confession the accused may not yet avail of the
services of his lawyer (Escobedo v. Illinois of the United States Federal
Supreme Court, 378 US 478, 1964).  <u>Since
petitioner in the course of his identification in the police line-up had not
yet been held to answer for a criminal offense, he was, therefore, not deprived
of his right to </u><u><span style="">be </span>assisted
by counsel because the accusatory process had not yet set in</u>.  The <span style="">police
</span>could not have violated petitioner's right to counsel and due process as
the confrontation between the State and him had not begun.  <u>In fact, when he </u><u><span style="">was </span>identified in the police line-up by
complainant he did not give any statement to the police</u>.  He was, therefore, not interrogated at all
as he was not facing a criminal charge.  <u>Far from what he professes, the police did not, at that stage, exact
a confession to be used against him</u>.  For it was not he but the complainant who <span style="">was </span>being investigated at that time.  He ‘was ordered to sit down in front of the complainant while the
latter was being investigated' (par. 3.03, Petition).  Petitioner's right to counsel had not accrued (underscoring
supplied).<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This ruling was reiterated in the recent case of People v.
Santos.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
We similarly find in the case at bench.  There is nothing in the records which shows that in the course of the
identification from the police line-up the police investigator sought to
extract any admission or confession from appellant.  Thus far, we agree with the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">But we sustain the defense on the insufficiency of the
identification of appellant Orlando Frago.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful dissection of the testimony of Jicelyn herself
indubitably shows that she has no reliable basis for pointing to the accused as
the person who raped her.  She says that
his face was covered; that he had long hair; that while the person who raped
her had high nose <i>(matangos</i>) his nose is just "katamtaman";
that she did not have the opportunity to observe the height of the rapist; and,
that the only evidence of sexual intercourse is the result of the medical
examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that the "contusion, abrasion all over the
face, around the neck, presence of scratch marks on both medial surface of
thigh"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
did not necessarily indicate resistance on her part, contending further that it
is a matter of judicial notice that passionate kissing and petting could
normally produce "injuries." According to him, Jicelyn herself
disclosed that she had a suitor for whom she had "feelings of
affection," thus concluding that she may have submitted herself to him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>rule of long
standing in this jurisdiction, reverence to which remains undiminished to this
day, is that the Court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court
in passing upon the credibility of opposing witnesses unless there appears in
the record some fact or substance of weight and influence which has been
overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted.  This is due to the fact that the trial court
is in a better position to weigh conflicting testimonies, having heard the
witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are indeed reasons to deviate from the general rule.  We have examined carefully the entire
transcript of stenographic notes and we do not hesitate to conclude that the
exception to the rule must be applied.  There was <u>no positive identification</u> of Orlando Frago by
Jicelyn.  Her testimony on direct
examination supports this conclusion.  While she would make it appear that she was able to positively identify
the accused, her account of the incident proved otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">There seems to be no question that, on the part of the Pastera
sisters, they may have recognized appellant positively because their room was
lighted with a wick/gas lamp<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> and
he was not wearing anything on his face.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> They
identified him on 28 September 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
whereas Jicelyn pointed him out only on 8 October 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The possibility that Jicelyn had conferred with the Pastera sisters regarding the
identity of the accused before she testified is not remote because they were
neighbors.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
As a consequence, when Jicelyn testified on 13 August 1991, she gave the same
description of her attacker as that given by Ronalyn Pastera.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, we are inevitably drawn to the
conclusion that Jicelyn's identification of Orlando Frago was merely patterned
after the identification made by the Pastera sisters.  This is then a <u><span style="">derivative</span></u><span style="">, </span>not positive, <u><span style="">identification</span></u><span style="">.  </span>The
identification then of appellant by Jicelyn is doubtful.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Her testimony, standing alone, does not satisfy that quantum of proof required
to support a judgment of conviction.  The material discrepancies therein engender perplexity as to its
veracity and reliability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it appears highly incredible that Jicelyn could be
bodily lifted from her room in her boarding house and taken some three hundred
meters away to the vacant house of Dado Andor where she was supposedly abused<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
without awakening her and her two cousins who were all sleeping side by side
with her.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, we find the following observations of the Solicitor General decidedly
speculative, hence, unacceptable -</p>

<blockquote>x x x appellant's earlier act of fanning his handkerchief over the
face of Ronalyn Pastera evidently shows that there was something in it, most
likely drug, to induce her to remain sleeping.  This same method was apparently employed by appellant to Jicelyn Lansap
that kept her sleeping while being taken to another house and therein raped by <span style="">him,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">because a mere reading of Ronalyn's
testimony on cross-examination would indicate that she did not smell any
substance emanating from her attacker.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's denial and alibi are inherently weak, but the
prosecution cannot rely on their frailty to enhance its cause.  The prosecution must draw its strength from
its own evidence.  As has been
oft-repeated, every circumstance favoring the innocence of the accused must be
taken into account and <span style="">the proof </span>against
him must survive the test of reason.  Only when the conscience is satisfied that the crime has been committed
by the person on trial should the sentence be for conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Unfortunately for the prosecution, its evidence has miserably failed to pass
that conscience test.</p>
