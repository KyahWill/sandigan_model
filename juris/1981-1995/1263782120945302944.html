				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before Us on automatic review is the decision of the Cebu-Bohol Circuit Criminal Court in Criminal Cases Nos. CCC-XIV-2147 and CCC-XIV-2148, which found Eugenia Abano guilty of the crimes of parricide and murder, and Eliseo and Teofilo, both surnamed Cabaña, of two murders.&nbsp; Two death penalties were imposed on each of the accused.<br><br>The information dated May 7, 1980 in Criminal Case No. CCC-XIV-2147 for parricide and murder alleges:<br><blockquote><i>"That on or about the 7th day of February, 1980 at 11:30 o'clock in the evening, more or less in Sitio Tunga, Barangay Cantuod, Municipality Balamban, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Eugenia Abano, then united in lawful wedlock with Agripino Abano, and conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another with Eliseo Cabaña alias Lucio Cabaña and Pablo Cabaña alias Teofilo Cabaña, armed with sharp bladed weapons, with evident premeditation and treachery and in consideration of a prize or reward for the accomplishment their criminal purposes, with deliberate intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab the said Agripino Abano with the weapons aforecited thereby inflicting upon the latter multiple wounds on the vital parts of the body which injuries caused, as a consequence, the instantaneous death of the victim.<br><br>"In addition to the above qualifying circumstances, the offense was committed with the aid of armed men; superior strength and arms; nighttime; in consideration of the prize or reward and perpetrated in the dwelling of the victim."</i></blockquote>Except for the difference in the name of the accused, the absence of the allegation on the accused's relationship to the victim and the fact that Bienvenida Cumad is identified as the victim, the information for murder in Criminal Case No. CCC-XIV-2148 is also dated May 7, 1980 and couched in basically the same language.<br><br>The prosecution's version of the crimes is as follows:<br><br>Eugenia Tolero Abano and Agripino Abano were married in 1948.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> At the time of the commission of the crimes in February, 1980, they had been separated for three years.&nbsp; Eugenia, who was then 57 years old, stayed in the conjugal home in Cumbado, Balamban, Cebu with two of their children, one of whom was mentally incapacitated.&nbsp; To support her dependents, Eugenia worked as copra-maker earning eight pesos a day.<br><br>Agripino, 55 years old, lived with another woman, 50-year-old widow Bienvenida Cumad, at the Abanos' hut some 400 meters away from the conjugal home.&nbsp; Only a bridge separated the Abanos' conjugal home from the hut which was actually located in Tunga, Cantuod, Balamban, Cebu.<br><br>Behind Eugenia's house was another hut which used to be a pig pen.&nbsp; Elevated from the ground by about two feet, only a sack served as its door.&nbsp; It was occupied by Rodolfo Abano, a son of Eugenia and Agripino, and his family.<br><br>At around 7:00 o'clock in the evening of February 7, 1980, Rodolfo's wife, Concordia, saw Eugenia partaking of supper with Eliseo Cabaña and Teofilo Cabaña at the former's house.&nbsp; Concordia knew Eliseo and Teofilo because they were medicine men or quack doctors who frequented Cumbado to treat sick persons.<br><br>Just before midnight or at around 11:30 o'clock that night, Concordia was sleeping near the door of their hut, with her four children lying between her and her husband, when she was awakened by someone pulling her hair.&nbsp; As the hut was lighted by a kerosene lamp, she recognized the man pulling her hair to be Eliseo.&nbsp; With Eliseo was his son, Teofilo Eliseo was standing on the ground but he was able to reach for her hair because of her posi­tion near the door.<br><br>Eliseo tried to cover her mouth and cautioned her not to make any noise.&nbsp; Afraid of what he might do to her with the bolo [pinuti] she noticed he was carrying, Concordia jumped out of the hut.&nbsp; Eliseo then ordered her to accompany him to her father-in-law, Agripino.&nbsp; Along the way, Eliseo and Teofilo instructed her to tell Agripino that his son Rodolfo [Concordia's husband] was suffering from a stomach ache and that he should be brought to a doctor.<br><br>Upon reaching Agripino's hut, Concordia called him saying, "Tay, Tay, wake up, bring Rudy to the doctor because he is suffering stomach ache".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Agripino answered by asking her why Rudy had stomach ache.&nbsp; Concordia told him that Rudy had eaten some­thing raw.<br><br>Eliseo then dragged Concordia towards the road, pointed the bolo at her and said, "You run now, but do not tell your husband about this because if you will tell him I will kill your husband and all the members of your family".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Concordia ran and hid for some time under the big stove between Eugenia's house and her hut before proceeding home.<br><br>Delia Cumad, the 15-year-old daughter of Bienvenida, who was then sleeping in one of the two rooms of Agripino's hut was likewise awakened by Concordia's voice.&nbsp; She heard Concordia telling Agripino that Rudy was sick because he ate something raw.&nbsp; Then she noticed Agripino pass by her on his way to the hut's door.&nbsp; When Agripino was already downstairs, Delia heard an impact the sound of which resembled that of the hacking of a banana trunk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Then she head Agripino calling out, "Day, help Day, I am hacked".&nbsp; Delia tried to prevent her mother Bienvenida from going down the hut but the latter persisted.&nbsp; Bienvenida brought along a kerosene lamp.&nbsp; Because she was afraid, Delia did not even try to peep through the window to see what was happening.&nbsp; Neither did she hear Bienvenida and Agripino mention any names while they were outside the hut.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Almost an hour later, Delia came down the hut.&nbsp; She looked for Agripino and Bienvenida but failed to find them.&nbsp; Scared, she ran to the house of Rosario Montero.&nbsp; On the way, Delia met Rudy and Concordia Abano.&nbsp; Rudy asked her where she was going.&nbsp; Delia replied that she was going to the house of Rosario Montero.&nbsp; She did not tell them what happened to Agripino and Bienvenida.<br><br>As it was too quiet in Rosario's house, Delia proceeded to the house of Pesing Baynas to whom she related what had transpired at their hut.&nbsp; Pesing accompanied her back to their hut.&nbsp; Four meters from that hut, they found the lifeless body of Bienvenida.<br><br>Rodolfo Abano was awakened by his mother Eugenia at around midnight.&nbsp; She asked him to transport Eliseo and Teofilo Cabaña to Matab-ang, Toledo City in his motorized tricycle.&nbsp; When Rodolfo said that he would rather transport them in the morning, Eugenia told him that Eliseo and Teofilo were in a hurry.<br><br>At that time, Concordia was feeding her baby but she accompanied Rodolfo to the garage to get the motorized tricycle.&nbsp; It was on the way to the garage that they met Delia Cumad.<br><br>From the garage, Rodolfo went back to his hut where, after Concordia had alighted from the tricycle, Eugenia boarded it.&nbsp; Near her house, Eugenia got off and Eliseo and Teofilo boarded the tricycle.&nbsp; As he was ferrying them to Matab-ang, Rodolfo noticed that they were carrying a piece of sack that was rolled over a two-feet-long object.&nbsp; From Matab-ang, Rodolfo went back to Cantuod.&nbsp; There he met Bernie Verdeflor who told him that his father and his common-law wife were dead.<br><br>Bienvenida D. Cumad died of "cardio-respiratory arrest secondary to shock and hemorrhage due to multiple wounds on the neck [head], trunk and extremities".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In the medico-legal necropsy report, she is identified as Bienvenida Delfin Abano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Actually, her maiden name was Bienvenida Mancia Delfin but she was mistaken for the legal wife of Agripino by Doctor Ladislao V. Diola, Jr. who conducted the autopsy on the two victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Bienvenida sustained an avulsion which penetrated her skull, and four lacerated wounds in the anterior portion of the neck, the right lumbar region, the right iliac region and the right wrist.&nbsp; The inferior vena cava on both sides of her neck and the left carotid arteries were lacerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Agripino Albano also died of "cardio-respiratory arrest secondary to shock and hemorrhage due to multiple wounds on the head, trunk and extremities".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He sustained twelve lacerated wounds and an abrasion on the head and neck, and twenty-one lacerated wounds, five stab wounds and an avulsion in his trunk and extremities.&nbsp; He had a half-moon fracture in his cranium extending from the left to the right temporal bone and other fractures in his orbital and ethmoidal bones, third cervical vertebra, seventh rib and left elbow joint.&nbsp; He also suffered a subarachnoidal hemorrhage of the brain, and laceration in his upper lobe left lung, middle lobe right lung, septum, right ventricle and right kidney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the course of the investigation conducted by the police, Delia Cumad, Rodolfo Abano, Concordia Abano, Eugenia Abano, Eliseo Cabaña and Pablo [Teofilo] Cabaña were interrogated.&nbsp; Significantly, only the interrogations of Rodolfo and Delia were reduced to writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In his sworn statement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Rodolfo narrated that at about twelve noon of February 9, 1980, his mother, Eugenia, revealed to him that she hired Eliseo and Pablo [Teofilo] Cabaña to kill Agripino and his common-law wife.<br><br>Because of that statement, Vicente S. Cabahug, the sub-station commander of the Balamban Police Force, interrogated Eugenia.&nbsp; At the trial court, Cabahug re­lated how he investigated Eugenia.&nbsp; He testified thus:<br><br><table  ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"><em>"Q.</em></div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify"><em>After the revelation of Rodolfo Abano that it was her mother who hired the other two accused to kill the deceased Agripino Abano and Bienvenida Cumad, what else did you do?</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><em>A. </em></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><em>After the revelation of the said Rodofo Abano of the killing of the father and the common-law wife, I investigated Eugenia Abano as she was made to stay around, then at about 11:00 o'clock on February 11 in the morning, 1980, she admitted and confirmed the revelation of her son, Rodolfo Abano.<br><br></em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><em>COURT [To the witness]:<br><br></em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><em>Q. </em></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><em>But what did she admit?</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><em>A.</em></div></td> <td> <div align="justify"><em>She admitted and she narrated to me that she even burst tears telling me of the agony that she suffered for the last three years her husband was living in the house with a girl aside room her and they were living 200 meters away where she lives and she confided and confessed that she was forced to him the two accused, these Eliseo and Teofilo Cabaña to kill her husband and common-law wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="center"><em>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br></em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><em>ATTY.

But there is no proof that Cabahug offered to secure one for her at the instance of the State especially after she had manifested that she could not afford to hire her own counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Cabahug's omission to make such offer is a grave one.&nbsp; It rendered her alleged confession inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Similarly, there is no evidence that Eugenia was informed of her right to remain silent.&nbsp; Neither is there proof that she had voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived that right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as the unchallenged testimony of Eugenia reveals, she made the confession because the chief of police promised that she would "not be included in the case" as she would be discharged as a prosecution witness.&nbsp; Considering her emotional and mental state at that time, that promise must have overcome Eugenia's better judgment.&nbsp; It became a factor which contributed to the inadmissibility of her confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Chief of police Cabahug's uncorroborated testimony on the confessions of Eliseo and Teofilo Cabaña is likewise bereft of indications that he had observed the procedural safeguards mandated by the Constitution to which the Cabañas are entitled as a matter of right.&nbsp; In fact, from Eliseo's unrebutted testimony, use of threats to extract their alleged confessions is evident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>We agree with the Solicitor General that the municipal judge who conducted the preliminary investigation need not apprise Eugenia of the nature and gravity of the charges against her and the consequences of her admission thereof when she appeared as witness for Concordia Abano.&nbsp; During that investigation, all that was needed was for the investigating judge to remind her that she was under oath and that she should "tell the truth and nothing but the truth".<br><br>But the Solicitor General overlooked an aspect in the presentation of Eugenia as her daughter-in-law's witness which cannot pass the test of fundamental fairness.&nbsp; She was presented as such witness after she had waived her right to preliminary investigation and at a time when she was unassisted by counsel.&nbsp; As it were, Eugenia, an unschooled copra-maker, was left to fend for herself in a proceeding wherein she herself was the accused.<br><br>What added gall to her bitter predicament was the fact that she was presented as a witness to forestall the further detention of her daughter-in-law and insure the latter's discharge as her co-accused&nbsp; only to find herself in the precarious situation of answering questions the implications of which may have been beyond her comprehension.&nbsp; Ironically, the investigating judge cited "human considerations" as a reason for discharging Concordia as an accused, unmindful of the fact that in allowing Eugenia to incriminate herself, he was trampling on her rights as an accused.<br><br>As this Court enunciated in <i>Chavez vs. Court of Appeals, </i>L-29169, August 19, 1968, 24 SCRA 663, 680 and in <i>Bermudez vs. Castillo,</i> 64 Phil. 483, 488, the rule against self-incrimination positively intends to avoid and prohibit the certainly inhuman procedure of compelling a person "to furnish the missing evidence necessary for his conviction".&nbsp; In the <i>Chavez</i> case, we expressed the view that the rule may apply even to a co-defendant in a joint trial.<br><br>The situation would have been different had Eugenia been assisted by counsel during the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; For then, she could have availed herself of legal advice on when to refrain from answering incriminating questions.<br><br>We consider the absence of Eugenia's counsel when she appeared as witness during the preliminary investigation as an irreparable damage which rendered inadmissible her alleged confession.<br><br>The inadmissibility in evidence of the accused's extrajudicial confession, notwithstanding, We find the "web of circumstantial evidence" which the trial court found sufficient for conviction, to have remained unimpaired.&nbsp; Under Section 5 of Rule 133, circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if:&nbsp; [a] there is more than one circumstance; [b] the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and [c] the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; These requirements have been satisfied in the case at bar.<br><br>Concordia testified that she saw Eugenia Abano with her co-accused, Eliseo and Teofilo Cabaña, taking supper together at the former's house hours before the commission of the crimes; that Eliseo and Teofilo forced her [Concordia] to accompany them to Agripino's hut and in order to draw Agripino out of said hut, instructed her to say that her husband Rodolfo needed to be brought to a doctor because of a stomach ache; and that after she returned to her hut, Eugenia woke Rodolfo to ask him to bring Eliseo and Teofilo in his motorized tricycle to Matab-ang, Toledo City.&nbsp; This testimony was not rebutted, but in fact corroborated in part by Delia Cumad, who testified to hearing Concordia calling to Agripino to bring Rodolfo to a doctor as he was suffering from a stomach ache; and by Rodolfo himself, who testified to his being roused from sleep by his mother Eugenia with the request to bring the Cabañas to Matab-ang, Toledo City.&nbsp; Noteworthy is the fact that her request came shortly after the victims were hacked to death as it was while Rodolfo and Concordia were on their way to get the tricycle from the garage that they met Delia, who was then on her way to a neighbor's house to seek help.<br><br>Rodolfo testified that from the garage, he went back to his hut, where after Concordia had alighted from the tricycle, Eugenia boarded it up to a place near the latter's hut where she got off and the Cabañas in turn boarded it.&nbsp; Rodolfo likewise stated that he noticed the Cabañas carrying a piece of sack rolled over a two-foot object.<br><br>The events narrated by Concordia, Delia and Rodolfo constitute an unbroken chain of natural and rational circumstances, which corroborate each other and point beyond reasonable doubt to the complicity of the accused in the crimes.<br><br>The defense attempted to discredit Concor­dia by turning the tables on her.&nbsp; No reason nor motive was however proferred why Concordia would commit the crimes or why she would falsely accuse her own mother-in-law and the Cabañas, who were virtual strangers and against whom she held no grudge, of crimes so grave.&nbsp; On the other hand, among the persons implicated, it was Eugenia Abano who had the motive to order the killing of her hus­band and his paramour.&nbsp; Her initial protestation that she harbored no ill-feelings toward her hus­band and his common-law wife was totally negated by her very own testimony that Agripino used to box and maltreat her every time she objected to his cohabitation with Bienvenida and the suspicion she expressed that it was Bienvenida who induced her husband to maltreat her so that she would die and they would be free to live together.&nbsp; Because her husband was "brave" she could not do anything openly about the situation and she merely kept her resentment concealed within her.&nbsp; Human nature as it is, the tendency is for pent-up emotions to grow and magnify, rather than diminish and disappear, particularly where the cause thereof is constantly present, as in the case at bar, and it is not uncommon in the realm of human experience for such emotions to burst and translate themselves into violence -- thus, the so-called crimes of passion.<br><br>The Court sympathizes with the most pitiful plight of Eugenia Abano.&nbsp; How she must have suffered during the three years that her husband lived with his paramour.&nbsp; The wound in her heart, occasioned by the separation, never had a chance to heal, but was kept raw and bleeding by the brazen and cruel behavior of her husband maintaining a love nest so near the abandoned wife.&nbsp; Four hundred meters in an urban area may seem a long distance, but not so in a rural com­munity where the next-door neighbor may be housed at an even greater distance.&nbsp; It is indeed in cases like this, that the bounden duty of the court to apply the law becomes a painful task and the maxim "dura lex, sed lex" makes its full impact felt.&nbsp; In view of the exceptional circumstances obtaining in the case at bar, the Court recommends executive clemency for accused-appellant Eugenia Abano.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Cebu-Bohol Circuit Criminal Court in Criminal Cases Nos. CCC-XIV-2147 and CCC-XIV-2148, is hereby affirmed with the modification that the civil indemnities for the heirs of the deceased Agripino Abano and the heirs of the deceased Bienvenida Cumad are hereby increased to P30,000.00 each.&nbsp; For lack of necessary votes, the two death penalties imposed on each of the accused are hereby commuted to reclusion perpetua.&nbsp; Let copies of this decision be furnished the Minister of Justice.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, C.J., Feria, Yap, Narvasa, Alampay, Gutierrez, Jr., Cruz,</i> and <i>Paras, JJ., </i>concur.<br><i>Feliciano, J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;
