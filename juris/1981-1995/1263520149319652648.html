review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts, as set forth in the Brief
filed by the Solicitor General, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"After drinking 'tuba' in the evening of <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1976</st1:date>, appellants, Romeo Yap and <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amar</span>, <span class="GramE">proceeded</span>
to the house of a certain <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> Fer­nandez located
at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Magsikap</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> (Exhibits 'G' &amp; 'H'). Upon
arriving there, the two woke up and challenged <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
to come out of his house. The latter peeped through the window, and upon seeing
the appellants fully armed with a bolo and a gun, he did not go out of his
house. He recognized appellant Romeo Yap as the one with a bolo while the other
appellant <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amar</span>,
whose name he only came to know later when <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
was arrested by the authorities had a gun. <span class="GramE">(pp. 159-163, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From there, appellants left (pp. 163-164, Ibid) and proceeded
to the house of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span>, also located in the
same barrio. Upon reaching the latter's house, Romeo called out for Antonio.
Awakened the latter stood up to find out who the caller was and in effect saw
appellant Romeo Yap. The latter asked him to go down, which he did. There he
saw Romeo with his companion, <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amar</span>, armed with a bolo and gun, respectively (pp. 4-7,
Ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After informing Antonio where they came from earlier that
evening, Romeo asked the former to accompany them to Antonio's father-in-law,
Felipe Santiago because his (Romeo's) father wanted to meet them (pp. 9-10, Ibid;
<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '<span class="GramE">A').</span> At first, Antonio
refused; but he was forced to go with them when Romeo threatened to kill him.
The trio arrived at Felipe Santiago's house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>. Forthwith, Romeo instructed Antonio to call his
father-in-law, which the latter did (pp. 26­-30, Ibid). Waking up, Felipe
proceeded to the balcony near the stairways. Thereupon, Romeo who meanwhile had
climbed the stairs introduced himself by saying '<span class="SpellE">Ako</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> <span class="SpellE">Miroy</span>'. Then he continue<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span><span class="SpellE">Natatandaan</span>
mo <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">ginawa</span> mo <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span>
<span class="SpellE">aking</span> <span class="SpellE">kapatid</span>?' To which
Felipe answered, '<span class="SpellE">Wala</span> <span class="SpellE">akong</span>
<span class="SpellE">ginawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">iyong</span> <span class="SpellE">kapatid</span>.' To this, Romeo
said, "<span class="SpellE">Magtapat</span> ka <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">totoo</span>, <span class="SpellE">pag</span> <span class="SpellE">hindi</span>
ka <span class="SpellE">nagtapat</span> <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span> ay <span class="SpellE">papatayin</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>.' Sensing trouble,
Felipe turned towards the door and was about to enter the room when all of a
sudden Romeo hacked him on the back with a bolo. Simultaneously, <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> cocked his gun and pointed its muzzle towards
Antonio. The latter immediately ran towards the woods nearby, even as Romeo
continued hacking to death the helpless Felipe inside the room of his house
(pp. 32-35, 58-62, Ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When appellants left, Felipe was already dead, lying
frustrate (sic) on the floor. Immediately, Felipe's wife who witnessed the
hacking of her husband, called for her brother, <span class="SpellE">Barto­lome</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bandiola</span>, residing about a hun­dred fifty meters
away. The latter responded and came to her sister's succor. Another brother, <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandiola</span>, also arrived
(pp. 62-64, 74-75, <span class="GramE">Ibid )</span>. <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span>
immediately reported the incident to the Police Headquarters of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and came back that same morning with Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Arnulfo</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Dimalaluan</span> and a police pho­tographer.</span> Shortly
thereafter, Sub­station Commander <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> Miranda
with another policeman also arrived. <span class="GramE">Upon instruction of his
chief, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimalaluan</span> moved the body of the
deceased Felipe to verify the wounds he sustained. He then prepared a sketch of
Felipe's cadaver (Exhibits 'C') showing the location of the wounds. (Exhibits
'C-1' to 'C-11'). Another sketch was also prepared showing the place where the
cadaver of Felipe was found lying frustrate inside the house (Exhibit 'D').
There­after, the photographer took <span class="GramE">picture's</span> of the
body of the deceased (Exhibits 'E', 'E-1' to 'E-7'). Follow-up investigation
was also conducted (pp. 79-89, 95, Ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequently, persons who had knowledge of the incident were
invited to the police headquarters where their sworn statements were taken.
Then on March 16 and 17, 1976, Romeo and <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
were ar­rested, one after the other by the police (pp. 233-234, 292, Ibid).
After waiving their constitutional rights to remain silent and be assisted by
counsel (Exhibit 'F'), appellants voluntarily gave their extrajudicial
confessions to the police (Exhibits 'G' and 'H'). (pp. 99-107, <span class="GramE">Ibid )</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

the evening of March 11, 1976, as he was at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Rumbang</span>,
where he resides, at the time; that he did not know the latter personally
during his lifetime; that he did not know where Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span>
was residing on that date; that HERMINIO <span class="SpellE">Amar</span> was not
with him that evening; that he was made to sign a document which was</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">already

of 1976 during the town fiesta; that he was not with ROMEO in the evening of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Being mixed up was quite
understandable because Antonio had refused to go with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">ROMEO </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="NUM">3) The defense further submits that Antonio could not have
witnessed the hacking of his father-in-law because of his actuation immediately
thereafter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span>merely running to
the forest and spending the night there instead of calling for help or in­forming
the authorities. As testified to by Antonio, however, simultaneously with the
hacking of the victim by ROMEO, HERMINIO had cocked his gun and was aiming it
at Antonio. Fearful of his life, he ran towards the woods and stayed there till
the next morning. In fact, when he met Orlando Pablo that early morning the
latter greeted Antonio by saying: "<span class="SpellE">Mabuti</span> <span class="SpellE">buhay</span> ka pa. <span class="SpellE">Diyan</span> ka <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">lang</span></span>, <span class="SpellE">pupunta</span>

mo. <span class="SpellE">Kakaway</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">mamaya</span>". The reason was because Orlando Pablo
"thought <span class="SpellE">Miroy</span> Yap killed me".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

There was reason, therefore, for Antonio to be fearful <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">of </span>has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">own </span>life.
Besides, the next morning at the crime scene, Antonio revealed to the police
what had happened and what he had witnessed the night before.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The fact that Antonio
gave </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>statement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(Exhibit "A") to the police only 3
1/2 days after </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">incident, or </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">March 14, 1976, does </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">necessarily detract from his testimony
because that was not the first time that he had revealed his knowledge of the
crime to the authorities having done so already the morning after the incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Next, the defense asserts
that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Eliberda</span> Santiago, widow of the
victim, is equally </span>u<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">nworthy of </span>credence
because of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">inconsistency of her
version with that of Antonio. She testified that she saw </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">ROMEO </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">stab her husband to death inside the house whereas Antonio stated that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">ROMEO </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">did so at the balcony. There is no real contradiction, however. The
wounds sustained by the </span>victim indicate that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">he was hacked several times. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">ROMEO </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hacked the </span>deceased
for the first time while the latter was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">still
</span>in the balcony about to enter the room and thereafter, succes­sively,
after the deceased was inside that room. It is likely that <span class="SpellE">Eliberda</span>
did not see the stabbing at the balcony because she was inside the room. The
photographs taken of the victim (Exhibits "E", "E-1" to
"E-3") actually show him prostrate on the floor inside the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, there lurks no doubt in our minds that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">two </span>eye­witnesses, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Antonio </span><span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eliberda</span> Santiago, saw the actual <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">stabbing and that their testimonies deserve
credence. They iden­tified appellants without hesitation. Their testimonies
were also substantially corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
Fernandez, who declared that the accused had passed his place first but because
he refused to go down they left. <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> recognized
ROMEO as the one with the bolo, and HERMINIO, whose name he did not know at the
time, as the one carrying a gun. Thereafter, appellants went to the house of
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span> around 11:00 o'clock in the evening.
Delia <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span>, Antonio's wife, also categorically
declared that both appellants had gone to their place in the evening of March
11, 1976, and forced her husband to go with </span>them to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the house of the victim, her father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We are in accord with the
Trial Court's rejection of the testimonies of appellants denying the commission
of the crime. Their denials do not ring with truth and cannot prevail over the
positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses. HERMINIO denied
having known ROMEO for some time and declared that he came to know ROMEO only
in the Courtroom; but from his own testimony, he was even arrested in <span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span> house. It may he that ROMEO may not have known the</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">victim personally but in his (<span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span>) mind it was the victim who was responsible for his
(<span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span>) brother's death. ROMEO attempts to
repudiate his extrajudicial confession (Exhibit "G"). However, he
admitted his signature at the bottom thereof and that he signed it before
Municipal Mayor Miranda.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> In his statement, ROMEO even narrated how he
and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">HERMINIO </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">first had a drink of "tuba" before
the incident how the victim seemed to be looking for something when he turned
to go inside the house for which reason he stab­bed him first; how he and the
victim had struggled for possession of the bolo thereby alleging the
exculpatory circumstance of self-defense; how HERMINIO helped by firing into
the air; and that the entire incident was witnessed by the victim's wife and a "<span class="SpellE">dalagita</span>". Indeed, the details recited therein, which
could have been known by him alone, negate the defense theory that his
confession was involuntary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In <span class="SpellE">HERMINIO's</span>
statement (Exhibit "H"), he, too, described in detail how he was at <span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span> father's house because the latter had "<span class="SpellE">nagtalok</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">palay</span>";
how he and ROMEO had a drinking spree afterwards, after </span>which they went <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to <span class="SpellE">Pilo</span> Fernandez's
place, thence to the house of another person to whom ROMEO spoke, and from
there to a house outside the barrio; the stabbing that oc­curred thereat; and
that he himself carried a gun which belonged to ROMEO. HERMINIO submits,
however, that he was maltreated and forced into signing his own confession.
During the trial, his lawyer called attention to signs of contusion on different
parts of his body. The trial Judge, however, made no comment and gave no
credence to the claim of involuntariness in his Decision.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The fact is that whether
or not the confessions were given voluntarily </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of no moment.
Appellants' confessions are un­necessary to prove their guilt and can even be
entirely disre­garded. There is overwhelming evidence on record, through the
testimonies of eyewitnesses Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eliberda</span> Santiago, corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
Fernandez and Delia <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span>, to prove appellants'
culpability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The defense of alibi put
up by appellants was also correctly rejected by the Trial Court. Not only is it
the weakest of defenses but more </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">because the defense has not
satisfactorily shown that it was impossible for appellants to have been at the
scene of the crime at the time of its commission. Appellants had met at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saligsig</span> where they drank
"tuba", which is near <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Curimas</span> where the victim lived and where the killing took
place, and is also near Barrio <span class="SpellE">Magsikap</span> where Antonio
<span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
Fernandez resided. The fact also is that appellants went back home to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Rumbang</span> after the fatal incident. Besides, in addition to
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe's</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eliberda</span>
Santiago's testimonies, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> Fernandez and Delia <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span> categorically testified that both accused were
together when they went to their respective homes that fateful evening of March
11, 1976. Alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In respect of the
aggravating circumstances, treachery was properly appreciated by the Trial
Court. The victim was attacked initially at the back as he was entering his
room from the balcony. It was treacherous because appellants employed means and
methods in the execution of the offense, which tended directly and specially to
insure its execution without risk to themselves arising from the defense that
the victim might have made. The latter was unarmed and was just awakened from
his sleep, whereas ROMEO was armed with a bolo and HERMINIO with a local gun </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">known </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">as "<span class="SpellE">pugakang</span>". That ROMEO had
previously warned the victim that he would kill the latter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">if </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">he did not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">tell </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the truth, does not negate the treacherous
manner in which the victim was attacked. At that moment, appellants, both
armed, had already positioned themselves in such a way that it was impossible
for the victim to have evaded the attack as he turned around to enter the room,
specially considering that HERMINIO was also standing guard with a cocked gun </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Evident premeditation has
also been adequately shown. ROMEO suspected the victim of being responsible for
the death of his (<span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span>) brother. In the evening of
March 11, 1976, they drank "tuba" in <span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span>
house presumably to embolden themselves. Then, with ROMEO armed with a bolo,
and </span>HERMINIO <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with a gun given by
</span>ROMEO, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">they <span class="GramE">proceeded</span>
to the house of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> Fernandez, a friend </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the victim, who foiled their evil
intent by refusing to go down his house. The fact that appellants were singing
noisily as they approached Fernandez's place does not negate their intent to
avenge <span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span> brother's death. From Fernandez's
place, they walked </span>all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the way
to the victim's house in the middle of the night right after threatening and
forcing the vic­tim's son-in-law to accompany them. Once face to face with the
victim, they acted in concert, with ROMEO hacking the victim several times
while </span>HERMINIO <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">stood by holding
his gun, cocking and thereafter pointing it at Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span>.
From the time appellants left <span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span> house, and even
from the time they left <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> Fernandez's place,
sufficient time had elapsed for them to reflect </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their plan. But they clung to their determi­nation
and executed their </span>plan <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
avenge the death of <span class="SpellE">ROMEO's</span> brother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The circumstances of
abuse of superior strength, <span class="SpellE">noctur­nity</span> and dwelling,
although not alleged in the Information, were also correctly appreciated by the
Trial Court as they were proven at the trial and should, therefore, be taken
into consideration </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
imposition of the penalty.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There was abuse of
superior strength because although HERMINIO did not directly take part in
attacking the victim, he acted as look-out and his presence with a gun
prevented any­body from coming to succor the victim. HERMINIO even cocked his
gun while ROMEO was mercilessly hacking the victim and pointed the gun at
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span> to ensure non-interference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Nocturnity</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> was also present because had it not been for
the darkness of night, the victim could have noticed the deadly weapons that
appellants were carrying and could have become suspicious. And because of the
darkness and lateness of the hour when everybody was fast asleep the victim's
brother-in-law who was residing about a hundred and fifty meters away could not
come to the rescue. It was only when the victim's wife shouted for help that he
arrived. Nighttime facilitated the commission of </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Craft or fraud, too,
although neither alleged in the Information, attended the commission of the
crime because had not ROMEO cunningly utilized the son-in-law, Antonio, to call
the victim in the middle of the night, the probability is that the victim would
have been more suspicious of a midnight caller and would not have been induced
to respond.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">element of conspiracy, there should be no
room </span>for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">doubt as to its
existence. Appellants acted in concert to attain the same objective. After
drinking "tuba" they were al­ways together from <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
Fernandez's place where they threatened the latter, to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe's</span> house where they forced the latter to go with
them, and up to the victim's house where the killing took place. HERMINIO stood
watch while ROMEO continued stabbing the victim to his death. HERMINIO also
cocked his gun and aimed it at Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alonsabe</span> to
prevent the latter from </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">giving </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">succor. The facts and circumstances of the
