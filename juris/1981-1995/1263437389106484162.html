				<BR><STRONG>VITUG, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for review challenges (1) the Resolution, dated 28
June 1993, of the Office of the Ombudsman finding petitioners guilty of simple
misconduct and oppression in the performance of official duties and
recommending the penalty of a 2-month suspension from office, without pay, and
(2) the Order, dated 29 July 1993, rejecting petitioners’ motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The occurrence that sparked this controversy happened at around
two o’clock in afternoon of 16 February 1993 in a logjammed traffic intersection
in Makati.  The incident, for a time,
hugged the front pages of some major dailies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Nemesio Arturo S. Yabut, Vice Mayor of the
municipality, was directing traffic at the intersection of Sen. Gil Puyat
Avenue and Makati Avenue, he being concurrently the commander of the Traffic
Management Division of Makati.  On that
day, traffic was unusually heavy because of the re-routing of the vehicular
flow from the Edsa-Pioneer-Boni area.  Private respondent Paul Doran, an American national and a permanent
resident in the Philippines, was on board his car in the innermost lane of
Makati Avenue, apparently intending to make a left turn to Gil Puyat Avenue
towards Pasay City.  Since priority was
given to vehicles coming from Mandaluyong, Doran and the others in his lane had
been made to wait for several turns.  When the “go” signal was finally given, Doran stopped where Yabut was
and asked “why (it took) so long to make a left turn?” Petitioner Yabut
answered “Sorry, sir, its traffic.” This did not satisfy Doran who exclaimed,
“who the hell are you,” and stuck a dirty finger sign at Yabut.  Angry words soon turned into an exchange of
punches between the two.  Ultimately, Yabut’s
traffic officers joined the fray.  They
pulled out Doran from his car and started beating him until three men rescued
Doran and brought him to the nearby Pacific Star Building.  Both Yabut and Doran suffered injuries as a
result of the scuffle.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 February 1993, Doran made a formal complaint against Yabut
before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), which summoned Yabut on 24
February 1993 to appear before its Anti-Organized Crime Division (AOCD).  Yabut asked for five (5) days within which
to file counter-affidavits; the NBI gave him two (2) days.  On 26 February 1993, Yabut filed his
affidavit and that of his witnesses.  The NBI forthwith indorsed the case to respondent Office of the
Ombudsman (Adm. Case # 0-93-0087), which promptly imposed a ninety-day
preventive suspension on Yabut.  On 02
March 1993, Yabut moved for the reconsideration of the suspension order.  In an Order, dated 12 March 1993, the
Ombudsman, through Overall Deputy Ombudsman Francisco Villa, resolved the
motion, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant be furnished with copies of
the affidavits of the respondent and his witnesses, and for the former, if he
so desires, to make a reply thereto within ten (10) days from receipt of the
same;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ricardo M. Tamargo,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
security aide of the respondent, be named as a co­respondent in the
above-entitled case; that he be furnished with copies of the sworn statements
of the complainant and his witnesses; and that he may file further responsive
pleadings, if he so desires, within ten (10) days from receipt of the same;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the respondent’s motion
to lift suspension order be held in abeyance until and after the respective
pleadings/evidence of the parties have been submitted.”<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, the parties submitted their respective evidence
consisting of the sworn statements of Yabut, Eleuterio Quiñones, <span style="">Jr., </span>Ricardo Tamargo, Roberto Barboza
and Cecilia Concha-Colmenares, for petitioners, and of Dr. Paul Doran, Alex
Pastrana, Epifanio Dagza and Harold Quenery, for private respondent Doran.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the preliminary conference held on 19 May 1993,
conformably with Rule III, Section 5, of Administrative Order No. 07, otherwise
known as the “Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman,” the parties
agreed to submit the case for resolution.  Yabut also moved for the lifting of his preventive suspension.  The following day, the preventive suspension
order was lifted.  The parties were each
given fifteen (15) days within which to submit their respective memoranda.  Yabut <span style="">and
</span>Tamargo filed their memorandum on 03 June 1993; Doran decided not to
file any.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 June 1993, the investigating officer (Amy Ana de
Villa-Rosero) submitted the questioned Resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
containing her findings and recommendation.  The resolution was approved by the Overall Deputy Ombudsman.  The decretal part of the resolution read:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, and pursuant to Section 25 of R.A.
No. 6770 and Section 10 of Administrative Order No. 07 of this Office, it is
respectfully recommended that respondents Yabut and Tamargo be meted with the <u>penalty</u>
<u>of</u> <u>suspension</u> <u>from</u> <u>office</u> <u>without</u> <u>pay</u>
for a period of two (2) months effective upon receipt of a copy of this
resolution.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO RESOLVED.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner Yabut filed a “Motion for
Clarification/Reconsideration.” In an Order, dated 29 July 1993, public
respondent denied the motion; <u><span style="">viz:<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote>“FINDING no valid reason to reverse or modify any finding in the
disputed resolution dated 28 June 1993, this Office hereby DENIES respondent’s
instant motion.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due time, petitioners filed the instant “Petition for Review,”
contending that the Ombudsman (1) misappreciated the evidence; (2) erred in not
crediting petitioner’s period of preventive suspension; and (3) erred in
imposing the penalty of two-month suspension from office, without pay, for not
being commensurate with the bare finding of simple misconduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prefatorily, it may be well to stress that appeals from
decisions/resolutions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases may merely raise
questions of law.  Factual findings of
the Ombudsman, unless clearly unsubstantiated, are conclusive; in fine, it is
only <span style="">when </span>there is grave abuse
of discretion by the Ombudsman that a review of factual findings can aptly be
made.  Specifically, Section 27 of
Republic Act No. 6770 (An Act Providing For The Functional And <span style="">Structural Organization Of The Office Of The
Ombudsman, And For Other Purposes) provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 27.   Effectivity and
Finality of Decisions.   - (1) All
provisionary orders at the Office of the Ombudsman are immediately effective
and executory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A motion for reconsideration of any order, directive or decision
of the Office of the Ombudsman must be filed within five (5) days after receipt
of written notice and shall be entertained only on any of the following
grounds:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>New evidence has been discovered which
materially affects the order, directive or decision;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Errors of law or irregularities have
been committed prejudicial to the interest of the movant.  The motion for reconsideration shall be
resolved within three (3) days from filing:  Provided, That only one motion for reconsideration shall be entertained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Findings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman when supported by
substantial evidence are conclusive.  Any order, directive or decision imposing the penalty of public censure
or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month’s salary shall be final and
unappealable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In all administrative disciplinary cases, <u>orders,</u> <u>directives,</u>
<u><span style="">or</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>decisions</u> <u>of</u> <u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Office</u>

</b><u>Rule</u><b> </b><u><span style="">45</span></u><span style=""> <u>of</u></span><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>Rules</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u>Court</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The above rules <u>may</u> <u><span style="">be</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>amended</u> <u>or</u><span style=""> </span><u>modified</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Office</u>
<u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u><span style="">Ombudsman</span></u><span style=""> </span>as the interest of justice may require.” (Underscoring
Supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In consonance with the foregoing, and on
the basis of Article XI, Section 13 (8) of the 1987 Constitution,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 7 of Administrative Order No. 07 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of
the Ombudsman) was promulgated.  Section
7 thereof expresses:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 7.   <b>Finality of
Decision.  - </b>Where the respondent is
absolved of the charge, and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is
public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine
equivalent to one month salary, the decision shall be final and
unappealable.  <u>In</u> <u>all</u> <u>other</u>
<u>cases,</u> <u>the</u> <u>decision</u> <u>shall</u> <u>become</u> <u>final</u>
<u>after</u> <u>the</u> <u>expiration</u> <u>of</u> <u>ten</u> (<u>10</u>) <u>days</u>
<u>from</u> <u>receipt</u> <u>thereof</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>respondent,</u>
<u>unless</u> <u>a</u> <u>motion</u> <u>for</u> <u>reconsideration</u> <u>or</u>
<u><span style="">p</span>etition</u> <u>for</u><span style=""> </span><i><u>certiorari</u></i> <u>shall</u>
<u>have</u> <u>been</u> <u>filed</u> <u>by</u> <u><span style="">him</span></u><span style=""> <u>as</u> <u>p</u></span><u>rescribed</u>
<u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Section</u> <u>27</u> <u>of</u> <u>RA</u> <u>6770.</u>”
(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, an appeal then by <i><u>certiorari</u></i> to this Court
would be the correct remedy, absent a clear case of grave abuse of discretion
on the part of the Ombudsman in which latter case Rule 65 may exceptionally be
invoked pursuant to Section 1, Article VIII, of the 1987 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition, we find neither an error of law nor
grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Ombudsman.</p>

<p class="BODY">The incident of 16 February 1993 was most unfortunate.  The attendant circumstances, it might be
said, could have well caused tempers to rise and patience to break;
nevertheless, they served no excuse for the mauling and shooting incidents that
followed.  While we certainly would not
condone the act of provocation made by Doran, which in the words of petitioners
was no less than “an act of spite, degradation and mockery,” it did not,
however, justify an equally abhorrent reaction from them.  Petitioners were public officers; Doran was
not.  We second the Solicitor General in
this observation:</p>

<blockquote>“A public official, more especially an elected one, should not be
onion skinned.  Strict personal
discipline is expected of an occupant of a public office because a public
official is a property of the public.  He is looked upon to set the example how public officials should
correctly conduct themselves even in the face of extreme provocation.  Always he is expected to act and serve with
the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency and
shall remain accountable for his conduct to the people.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Yabut urges that his preventive suspension of 82 days
should be credited to the penalty of 2-month suspension imposed on him.  A preventive suspension decreed by the
Ombudsman by virtue of his authority under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 6770,
in relation to Section 9 of Administrative Order No. 07, is not meant to be a
penalty but a means taken to insure the proper and impartial conduct of an
investigation.  We have ruled, in a
number of times before, that a preventive suspension may be ordered even before
the charges are heard, as well as before the official concerned is given an
opportunity to prove his innocence, being merely a measure that is precisely
designed in order not to hamper the normal course of an investigation through
the use of influence and authority.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.</p>
