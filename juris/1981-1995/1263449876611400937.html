If it could be shown that bias or partiality can plausibly be alleged by an

respondent Judge for the recovery of a sum of money and damages, the plaintiff
being San Miguel Corporation, now included as respondent in this suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion
was filed by him for the re-raffling of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1. <span class="GramE">That</span> in the
case entitled ‘People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
versus Dr. <span class="SpellE">Haniel</span> R. Castro, et. al.,’ Criminal Case
No. 1818, for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>, which was formerly assigned to
this court, the accused filed on July 12, 1977 a motion for inhibition of the
Honorable Presiding Judge which motion was granted on July 21, 1977; 2. <span class="GramE">That Dr. <span class="SpellE">Haniel</span> R. Castro, accused in
said criminal case, is the same Dr. <span class="SpellE">Haniel</span> R. Castro
who is the defendant in the present civil case; 3.</span> That because of the
aforementioned incident in the said criminal case, defendant Dr. <span class="SpellE">Haniel</span> R. Castro honestly feels that it would be for the
best interest of justice if the present civil case be re-raffled for assignment
to another branch."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Judge found the motion without merit and denied the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a motion for reconsideration where reference was made to his fear
that respondent Judge "would not be impartial in the instant case."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

Petitioner then filed this proceeding, his main reliance, to repeat, being
solely on the fact that in a motion for inhibition in a prosecution for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against petitioner,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
likewise assigned to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent Judge, a
motion for inhibition was granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court in a resolution required respondents to comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for private respondent San Miguel
Corporation did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His prayer was for
the dismissal of the case for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He included as one of his annexes the order of respondent Judge granting
a motion of then petitioner accused in a criminal case to inhibit himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order speaks for itself:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The motion of the accused that the
undersigned presiding Judge inhibit <span class="GramE">himself</span> from
trying this case is hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, what this Court was emphasizing was not to prejudge the
case against the accused, but merely placing an emphasis between the Padilla
view and the Sec. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos view on the commission
of the offense of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, with all candor and
sincerity, that there was no specific pre-adjudication of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record of the undersigned judge in
appealed cases (both criminal and civil) speaks for itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused is however entitled to be heard
in a court where he feels that justice can be meted out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he feels no complacency and feeling of
certitude that he can be given a fair and just trial, the accused is entitled
to be heard before a magistrate whom he thinks can <span style="">give </span>him such a fair trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is his right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, let it not be said, as can be borne out by the
Integrated Bar of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Chapter, that the undersigned Judge has been
unfair and unjust <span style="">in </span>the
hearing and adjudication of both civil and criminal cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be said, furthermore, that this
presiding judge did not have the opportunity of knowing both the accused and
the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the apprehension
of the counsel for the defense is more apparent than real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let this case be heard and decided by another
judge with ‘cold neutrality and impartiality' to satisfy the conscience of the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let, therefore, this case <span class="GramE">be</span> transmitted to the Honorable Executive Judge for
re-assignment of the same by re-raffle."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It <span style="">is </span>the submission of counsel
for respondent that the fear entertained by petitioner is more imaginary than
real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His voluntary disqualification in
a criminal case does not justify his inhibiting himself in a civil case just
because the same individual is one of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without any basis in the record, therefore,
for a finding "of bias or abuse of discretion" the petition cannot
succeed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, as noted earlier, reached the same conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even a cursory reading of the order of inhibition by respondent
Judge when petitioner was an accused <span style="">in
a </span>prosecution for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> would show that the
words uttered by him which gave rise to such a motion amounted to an expression
of his view on a legal question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
bias, if it could be accurately so described, reflects his under­standing of
and respect for a doctrine of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not one against any particular accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot result in the automatic conviction of every person indicted
for such offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence must still be
presented to justify a finding of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The constitutional presumption of inno­cence requires that the proof be
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Nonetheless, when respondent Judge let loose with language which to
an accused and a zealous counsel could be inter­preted as necessarily leading
to conviction, there is at least some plausible ground for seeking his
voluntary dis­qualification.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge thus acted commendably when he acceded to such a
plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case is entirely different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is a defendant in an action for
the recovery of a sum of money with a claim for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question involved is merely the
responsibility of petitioner as a co-owner and operator of a common carrier
which sank, with its cargo having been lost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Viewed objectively, therefore, it cannot be plausibly maintained that
under the circumstances the previous voluntary inhibition in a criminal case
suffices for his following the same course of action in this civil case just
because the accused in that criminal prosecution is the same individual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legitimate concern to assure both the
appearance and the reality of impartial adjudication cannot justify a judge
being found guilty of grave abuse of discretion in each and every instance
where his neutrality is put in issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, the factual circumstances must be carefully examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not in this case yield the conclusion
that respondent Judge failed to abide by the pronouncement of this Court as to
when a judge should voluntarily disqualify himself.</p>
