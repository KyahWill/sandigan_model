				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The only issue in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
is whether the petitioners' appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> in Civil Case No. 1201, may be
dismissed for tardiness in submitting their record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1962</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed an <span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">accion</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">publiciana</span> (Civil Case No. 1201) in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> against the private
respondent Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Magday</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the defendant had filed his answer, the
complaint was amended on <st1:date year="1971" day="25" month="8">August 25,
 1971</st1:date>, to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the Department of
Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Bureau of Lands as additional
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magday</span>
filed an amended answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary
of Agriculture <span class="GramE">and</span> Natural Resources and the Director
of Lands filed separate answers to the amended complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had submitted a stipulation of facts, the
court, upon plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings and/or summary
judgment, which the defendant did not oppose, rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1975</st1:date>, dismissing the
complaint with costs against the plaintiffs (Annex F, pp. 35-46, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration (Annex G, p.
47, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was denied by the respondent Judge on <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1975</st1:date> (Annex H, p. 50, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1975</st1:date>,
they filed a motion for leave to appeal as paupers (Annex J, <span style="">p. </span>52, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)
and on <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1975</st1:date>,
they filed a notice of appeal (Annex I, p. 51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court granted on <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1976</st1:date> their motion to
appeal as paupers (Annex K, p. 55, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Believing that as pauper litigants they did not have to submit a
record on appeal, they waited for the trial court to elevate the entire records
of the case to the Court of Appeals as provided in Section 16, Rule 41 of the
Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1976</st1:date>, respondent Judge dismissed the
appeal for failure to file a record on appeal (Annex L, p. 56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration (Annex M, p. 57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) of the
dismissal order was filed by the appellants on <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1976</st1:date>, they mailed their
record <span style="">on appeal to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="8">August <span style="">23, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court denied their motion for
reconsideration (Annex O, p. 60, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> by
the appellants raising the lone legal question of whether for the perfection of
an appeal by a pauper litigant, the timely submission of a record on appeal is
required.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the Rules of Court
then in force, a record on appeal was indeed required to be filed by a pauper
appellant although it did not have to be printed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As argued by the Solicitor General in his
brief:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"Petitioners contend, however, that having been allowed by
the lower court to appeal as paupers, they are not required to file a record on
appeal since the entire record of the case shall be transmitted to the
appellate court and the case shall be heard upon the original record so
transmitted without printing the same.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Sec. </span>16, Rule
41 of the Rules of Court, provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">" 'Sec</span>. 16, <i style="">Appeal by pauper</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>Where a party desiring to appeal
shall establish to the satisfaction of the trial court that he is a pauper and
unable to pay the expenses of prosecuting the appeal, and that the case is of
such importance, by reason of the amount involved, or the nature of the
questions raised, that it ought to be reviewed by the appellate court, the
trial <span style="">judge may enter an order
entitling the party to appeal as pauper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The clerk </span>shall <span style="">transmit
to the appellate court the entire record of the case, including the evidence
taken </span>on <span style="">trial <i>and</i> the </span><i style="">record</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">on</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">appeal</i><span style="">, </span><span style="">and the case shall be heard in the appellate court upon the original
record so </span>transmitted without printing the same.’ (Italic types supplied.)</p>

<blockquote><i>"It is clear that even a pauper litigant is required to
file a record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is not
required of him is the filing of a <u>printed record on appeal</u>, and, of
course, an appeal bond, since the cited Rule is designed to help the pauper
litigant who may not be able to pay the expenses of prosecuting the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, Sec. </i><i><span style="">17 </span>of the same Rule 41 which refers to
appeals in certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
and employee's liability cases categorically provides that 'the original record
of the case shall be transmitted to the appellate court <u>in lieu of the
record on </u></i><i><u><span style="">appeal</span></u></i><i><span style="">.' </span>In other words, appeals in special <span class="GramE">Civil</span> actions do not require record on appeal; they are
perfected </i><i><span style="">by </span>the mere
filing of the notice of appeal (Embroidery and Apparel Control and Inspection
Board vs. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, 20 SCRA 517 [1967]).<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Indeed, records on appeal have been filed by pauper
litigants as a matter of course (<span class="SpellE">Tiozon</span> vs. Court of
Appeals, 70 SCRA 284 [1976])." <span class="GramE">(pp. 7-9, Brief for the
Respondents; p. 109, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, under B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, which
has overtaken this case before it could be decided, a record on appeal <span style="">is </span>no longer required for the
perfection of an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This new rule
was given retroactive effect in <span class="SpellE">Alday</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Camilon</span>, 120 SCRA 521, where <span class="GramE">We</span>
ruled:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<i>The reorganization having been declared<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to have been completed, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 is now in full
force and effect. A record on appeal is no longer necessary for taking an
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same proviso appears in
Section 18 of the Interim Rules and Guidelines issued </i><i><span style="">by </span>this Court on January 11,
1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being procedural in nature, those
provisions may</i><i><span style=""> </span>be applied
retroactively for the benefit of petitioners, as appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Statutes regulating the procedure of the
courts will be construed as applicable to actions pending and undetermined at
the time of their passage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Procedural
laws are retrospective in that sense and to that extent.’ (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sumilang</span>, 77 Phil. 764)." <span class="GramE">(Cited <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Palomo</span>
Building Tenants Association, Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 133 SCRA
168; De Guzman vs. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 731; <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">Lagunzad</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 154
