				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Esquig</span>, had been the Land Registration Examiner in the
National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration (NALTDRA) since
1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Edna <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
was a Senior Clerk at the NALTDRA office in <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
1983, the position of Records Officer IV in the office of the Register of Deeds
in <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
became vacant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both <span class="SpellE">Esquig</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> applied for promotion to that position.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1987</st1:date>,
the Secretary of Justice appointed <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> to the
vacant position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Esquig</span>
sought <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> of the Secretary's action but
without success.</p>

<p class="BODY">He appealed to the Merit Systems Promotion Board <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">(MSPB) </span>of the Civil Service
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1989</st1:date>, the MSPB decided in his
favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Ferrerâ€™s</span>
turn to ask for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>, but the MSPB denied
her motion on <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="6">June
 8, 1989</st1:date>, she appealed to the Civil Service Commission (CSC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On November 21, 1989, the CSC decided in her
favor on the ground that as both <span class="SpellE">Esquig</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> possess the qualification standards for the position
in question and neither of them is next-in-rank<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> to the <span class="GramE">vacant</span> position of Records Officer IV, the appointing
authority has discretion to choose whom he deems to be best qualified and the
loser who is not next-in-rank is without legal personality to protest against
the Secretary's choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The relevant
observations of the Commission are quoted hereunder as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Esquig</span> has no legal personality to question the appointment
of Edna <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, on the ground that he is not a
next-in-rank employee as erroneously pointed out by the Board in its decision
dated January 18, 1989.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this point
Section 14 of Resolution 83-343 states in part:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> a <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">next-in-rank</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>employee
who is competent and qualified and who feels aggrieved by the promotion of
another may file a protest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'</p>

<blockquote>Stated in another manner, if one is not a
next-in-rank employee, he is not within the contemplation of this<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> particular provision.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Taking this into consideration, the Commission finds that the
appointing official has not acted in grave abuse of discretion in selecting the
appointee for the position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That being
so, and as the protestant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is not an employee
next-in-rank, the choice of the appointing authority must not be disturbed and
should be upheld.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this point, it is
said thus: 'The power to appoint is, in essence discretionary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appointing power has the right of choice
which he may exercise freely according to his judgment deciding for himself who
is best qualified among those who have the necessary qualifications and
eligibilities. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Pamantasan</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ng</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Lunsod</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ng</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Maynila</u></span> <u>v.</u>
<u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals,</u> <u>140</u> <u>SCRA</u> <u>22</u>.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, aside from the fact that the promotional appointment of
<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> to the position of Records Officer IV is found
to be within the sound discretion of the appointing authority, Protestant <span class="SpellE">Esquig</span> is found to have no personality to question the
same." <span class="GramE">(pp. 22-23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Esquig's</span> motion for reconsideration was
denied by the Commission, hence, this petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue raised in the petition is the <span class="SpellE">CSC's</span>
jurisdiction to review the decision of the MSPB since, as found by the latter, <span class="SpellE">Ferrer's</span> appeal was "a scrap of paper" because
she did not furnish the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (<span class="SpellE">Esquig</span>)
with a copy of her appeal (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission held, however, that <span class="SpellE">Ferrer's</span>
omission to furnish the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> with a copy of her
appeal "would not stop the Commission in deciding the case on the
merits" for "we do not strictly adhere to legal technicalities"
(p. 21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That ruling is supported by jurisprudence (<span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>,
et al. vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 82278, May 12, 1989; ASPREC vs. <span class="SpellE">Itchon</span>,
16 SCRA 921; <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> vs. De Castro, 163 SCRA 608).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the timeliness of <span class="SpellE">Ferrer's</span> appeal to
the CSC, the latter found:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
contrary to the allegation of <span class="SpellE">Esquig</span> that <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> filed her appeal beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the records reveal that <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> received a
copy of the MSPB decision on her motion for reconsideration dated May 12, 1989
only on May 30, 1989.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was
filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1989</st1:date> which
is well within the 15-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period." <span class="GramE">(p. 26, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This factual finding, based on the records of the case, is
presumed to be correct (Manila Mandarin Employees Union v. National Labor
Relations Commission, 154 SCRA 368).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, administrative proceedings are not bound by the rigid
requirements of the Rules of Court (Adamson &amp; Adamson, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, 152 SCRA 237).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The important consideration is that both parties were afforded an
opportunity to be heard and they availed themselves of it to present their
respective positions on the matter in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is denied for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against
the petitioner.</span></p>
