<p class="BODY">After hearing, the Regional Trial Court, Echague, Br. 24, on 6

Hydro (now petitioner) liable to pay realty taxes over the properties it had
constructed in connection with the Magat River Multi-Purpose Project, <u>but</u>

for review, raising the following issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">"I.  Whether or not
the appellate court has acted without <span style="">or
</span>in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in not
finding that the order issued by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on August 6,
1983 is merely interlocutory and/or provisional in character and could not be
considered as a final determination of the merits of Civil Case No. 0093.</p>

<p class="NUM">II.  Whether or not the
appellate court has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with
grave abuse of discertion in not finding that the said order of August 6, 1983
was abandoned or set aside through the issuance of the order of November 4,
1983 which admitted herein petitioner's third-party complaint against
respondent NIA.</p>

<p class="NUM">III.  Whether or not the
appellate court has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with
grave abuse of discretion in not finding that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, in
issuing the order of May 20, 1985 went beyond the issues presented by the
parties, which act is legally impermissible, irregular and invalid."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We grant the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both the petitioner and
the respondents agree that the main issue in the case at bar is whether or not
the assailed order of the court </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>qu</u></span><u>o</u>, <span style="">dated 6 August 1983, is interlocutory in nature or a final judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is to be observed that
while the complaint in the case at bar is admittedly one for collection of
realty taxes over certain real properties,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> filed against the petitioner, the complaint,

of such failure of the complaint to state the aforesaid amount vis-a-vis
plaintiffs' cause of action.  Although
this issue is not raised in the present petition, it is basic that the Court
can review matters not assigned as an error in the appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that the
complaint at bar has failed to state the ultimate facts,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which failure is violative of </span>Section

<p class="BODY">As admitted by the respondents, this case is one for collection
of realty taxes.  Section 82 of
Presidential Decree No. 464 (Real Property Tax Code) states that "the
delinquent real property tax shall constitute a lawful indebtedness of the
taxpayer to the province or city." Under P.D. 464, the process of
collecting real property taxes involves the acts or methods of <u>appraisal</u>
and <u>assessment</u> of the real property subject to tax;<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
the <u>imposition</u> of real property tax<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> and
the <u>collection</u> thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of taxes sought to be collected is therefore
determinable, yet, the complaint at bar did not plead the same.  In the order of the court <u>a</u> <u>q</u><u><span style="">uo</span></u><span style="">, </span>dated 7 February 1984, one of the issues submitted was whether
it was proper for the plaintiffs to amend their complaint and plead therein the
amount of tax sought to be collected.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> But
this issue was deemed abandoned when the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>issued an
order dated 20 May 1985, which held that the order dated 6 August 1983 was
final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in any case for collection of a sum of money, stating <u>the</u>
<u><span style="">amount</span></u><span style=""> </span>of tax sought to be collected in a
complaint for collection of realty taxes is part of the ultimate facts
constituting the plaintiff's cause of action, as provided under Section 3, Rule
6 of the Rules of Court, supra.  In the
instant case, there is failure to state in the complaint the ultimate facts
because the amount of tax sought to be collected is not pleaded or alleged.</p>

<p class="BODY">It can not be overlooked that the subject matter<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
of the complaint filed before the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>is the
amount of the real estate taxes to be collected.  Section 82 of P.D. 464 provides that the collection of delinquent
real property taxes may be enforced in any court of competent juris­diction.  In the present case, as the complaint did
not plead the amount of tax intended to be collected, how could the <span style="">court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> ascertain, in the
first place, in relation to the amount of the demand, whether it was the proper
forum to try the case?</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The fact that the third party complaint
filed by petitioner-defendant against the National Irrigation Administration
pleaded the amount of P338,750.00 as reimbursible to it by the latter, is of no
moment now, as the said third-party complaint was also ordered dismissed in the
order of 20 May 1985.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence, it can be said that the complaint (in
chief) was never amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While it may be true that
petitioner-defendant did not move to question the failure of the complaint to
plead the amount of tax sought to be collected, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
upon its own motion, may dismiss the complaint for failure of the plaintiffs to
comply with Section 3, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court in relation to Section 3,
Rule 17 thereof</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which provides that the action may be
dismissed for failure to comply with the rules.  This dismissal the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complaint being
fatally defective, the questioned order, dated 6 August 1983, which derived its
life from the said complaint, is also without effect.  But assuming <u>arguendo</u> that the filing of the complaint at
bar complied with the rules thereby making the order of 6 August 1983 valid,
the nature of said order is interlocutory.  It is not </span><span style="">a final </span><span style="">judgment.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The dispositive part of
said order states that petitioner-defendant is liable for the payment of real
property taxes, but, it adds, <u>further</u> </span><u>proceedings</u> <span style="">shall be held to determine the </span><span style="">amount </span><span style="">of real property taxes to be paid by petitioner-defendant.  Furthermore, the same order of 6 August 1983
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The defendant corporation also invoked the ground of no cause
of action in asking for the dismissal of the complaint.  In so doing, it adopted the stand that it
was denied due process by the fact that the notice of assessment was never
served upon it nor was it furnished copies of any Tax Declarations Nos. 03-2101
to 03-2113 mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the complaint and by the fact
that it was never served of any notice of delinquency in the payment of real
property tax nor was there any demand made upon it for payment thereof.  <u>To</u> <u>the</u> <u>Court</u>, <u>these</u>
<u>are</u> <u>matters</u> <u>or</u> <u>questions</u> <u>of</u> <u>facts</u> <u>which</u>
<u>necessitate</u> <u>presentation</u> <u>of</u> <u>evidence</u> <u>to</u> <u>prove</u>
<u>or</u> <u>disprove</u> <u>them</u>.  <u>At</u>

<u>the</u> <u>other</u>." (Underscoring supplied.)" (Rollo, p. 12)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As held in </span><u>De

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Separate opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MELENCIO-HERRERRA, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I concur with the legal
aspects of the majority opinion particularly with the conclusion that the
Complaint is </span>defective as it <span style="">failed
</span>to state ultimate facts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, considering that
(1) the case has proceeded to trial and judgment with no objection having been
interposed by petitioner-defendant to the absence of </span>specification
regarding the amount of taxes; (2) petitioner-defendant has been adjudged
liable for the payment of realty taxes by the Regional Trial Court of Echague,
Isabela, Branch 24, on 6 August 1983, which judgment has been affirmed by the
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 09196; (3) the dismissal of the case without
prejudice would only result in multiplicity of suits and the prolongation of
the controversy, which has been pending since 1982, it is my view that the
judgment of the Court of Appeals "ordering the reception of evidence only
for the purpose of determining the amount of realty taxes which petitioner was
adjudged liable to pay respondents" should be affirmed.  The practicality of the situation justifies
a departure from the strict mandate of procedural rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Order of the Regional Trial Court of Echague, Isabela, Branch
24, dismissing the Third-Party Complaint should also be set aside and the said
Complaint reinstated.  The determination
of the liability of the NIA to reimburse HYDRO for whatever taxes the latter
would pay to respondents could then be included in the proceedings to be
conducted by the Regional Trial Court of Santiago, Isabela, as decreed by the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing procedure would settle all issues in one and the
same case and obviate the need for another litigation with its corresponding
inherent delays.</p>
