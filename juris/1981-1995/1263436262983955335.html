<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We
granted, in our resolution of 23 June 1992, the </span>temporary mandatory
relief prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Manuelito was enrolled at the Perpetual Help College of Rizal
("PHCR") for the degree of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bachelor
</span>of Science in Criminology.  He
was elected Public Relations Officer ("PRO") of the Supreme Student
Council some time in August 1990.  Until
September 1991, he was the hold-over PRO and the acting Secretary of the
student council.  In this capacity, he
was invited to attend a meeting with PHCR officials on 08 May 1991.  Prior to said meeting, he was asked by the
Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Grace De Leon, to sign Resolution No.
105 that would implement, among other things, a 20% tuition fee increase for
the school year 1991-1992.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Manuelito refused to sign the resolution; instead, he asked for a 2-week period
to take the matter up with his fellow officers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the scheduled 08 May 1991 meeting, the student council
presented to PHCR a 9-point proposal.  With an assurance that the request of the student council would be
considered favorably, the petitioner finally signed Resolution No. 105.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 06 August 1991, PHCR announced that its application for
increase in tuition fees and other school charges for SY 1991-1992 for the
three levels, namely, the Grade School, High School and College, was approved
by the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports ("DECS").<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The student council filed with the DECS a motion for reconsideration.  Acting on the students' motion, the DECS, in
its letter of 28 August 1991 addressed to the President of PHCR, advised that
the "collection of the increase (should) be held in abeyance pending the
resolution of (the) matter."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the CMT commandant furnished PHCR a memorandum,
dated 20 August 1991, containing a list of PHCR CMT students (Manuelito
included) who were dropped <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">during </span>the
first semester of school year 1991-1992, with a recommendation that appropriate
action be taken on said students.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 04 September 1991, the school administration circulated a
memorandum<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that Manuelito had been dropped from PHCR's list of
students.  On even date, a letter<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
from Registrar Necy Buen was received by Manuelito, informing him that PHCR was
voiding his enrollment for the first semester of 1991-1992 because of the
following deficiencies:</p>

<blockquote>" *  Non compliance of CMT requirement as per
DECS Order No. 9, S. 1990 and DECS Memorandum No. 80, S. 1991 and PHCR Internal
Memo. No. 891-007;</blockquote>

<blockquote>*  No NCEE during the admission in the BS Criminology course;</blockquote>

<blockquote>*  Official Admission Credential not yet submitted;</blockquote>

<blockquote>*  Void declaration of CMT subjects (MS 11, 12, 21 and 22) which are
docketed in the registration card."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Beginning 05 September 1991, Manuelito was
no longer allowed to enter the school premises.  He forthwith sent a letter to the DECS informing the latter of
the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 October 1991, Director <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">Rosas </span>of the DECS issued an order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
addressed to the President of PHCR, stating, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, that:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * concerning the dropping from the rolls without due
process of the students-petitioners * * *, Manuelito Isabelo, Jr., * * *,
please be advised that pending resolution thereof, the propriety of allowing
the students to continue attending their classes to protect their interest as
well as that of the school, is hereby enjoined.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this connection, it is hereby directed that the above-named
students be readmitted to classes and be allowed to take all examinations that
they have missed pending final resolution of this case/issue."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">PHCR did not comply with the directive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this recourse.  The
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioner questions </span>PHCR's act
of voiding his enrollment.</p>

<p class="BODY">While this Court, on 23 June 1992, issued a preliminary mandatory
injunction ordering and directing PCHR to re-admit the petitioner for
enrollment,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the same was interdicted by PHCR's motion for clarification<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
that indeed would require factual assessments that have yet to be conclusively
passed upon administratively.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner claims that the real reason why PHCR has voided
his enrollment as a senior graduating student had been because of his active
participation in opposing PHCR's application for tuition fee increase with the
DECS.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, on the other hand, invokes "academic
freedom" in dropping the petitioner from its roll of students.  It argues that the petitioner has only been
allowed to enroll "conditionally" during the first semester of school
year 1991-92 pending the completion of his remedial classes in CMT, in which he
has failed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule in this jurisdiction since Garcia vs. Loyola School of
Theology,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
reiterated in Tangonan vs. Paño,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> has
been to uphold the rule that admission to an institution of higher learning is
discretionary upon the school and that such an admission is a mere privilege,
rather than a right, on the part of the student.  In Ateneo de Manila University vs. Capulong,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court cited with approval the formulation made by Justice Felix
Frankfurter of the essential freedoms subsumed in the term "academic
freedom"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
encompassing not only "the freedom to determine * * * on academic grounds
who may teach, what may be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">taught (and)
how </span>it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">shall be taught,"
but likewise "who may be admitted to study." We have thus sanctioned </span>its
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">valid invocation by a school in
rejecting students who are academically </span>delinquent,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
or a laywoman seeking admission to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
seminary,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> or students </span>violating "School

<p class="BODY">Like any other right, however, academic freedom has never been
meant to be an unabridged license.  It
is a privilege that assumes a correlative duty to exercise it responsibly.  An equally telling precept is a long
recognized mandate, so well expressed in Article 19 of the Civil Code, that
every "person must, in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">exercise
of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rights and in the performance of his duties,
act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another observation.  In
Non vs. Dames II,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> we
have already abandoned our earlier ruling in Alcuaz vs. PSBA<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
(that enrolment of a student is a semester to-semester contract, and that the
school may not be compelled to renew the contract) by recognizing instead the
right of a student to be enrolled for the entire period required in order to
complete his course.  We <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">have also stressed that the contract between
the school and the student, imbued, as it is, with public interest, is not an
ordinary contract.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this instance, it would seem that the principal reason
forwarded by the private respondent in dropping the petitioner from its roll of
students was his failure to complete some remaining units in the CMT
course.  He was unceremoniously dropped
from the roll when the semester was about to end some time in October.  He took a special training during the
semestral break (which was the most reasonable time to comply), and he was able
to pass it, but PHCR still refused to give him that accreditation, insisting
that he by then had ceased to be a student of PHCR.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we ordinarily would not delve into the exercise of sound
judgment, we will not, however, hesitate to act when we perceive taints of
arbitrariness in the process.  The
punishment of expulsion appears to us rather disproportionate to his having had
some unit deficiencies in his CMT course.  Indeed, the DECS itself is conceding to the grant of the instant
petition.  The circumstances lend truth
to the petitioner's claim that the private respondent has strongly been
influenced by his active participation in questioning PHCR's application for
tuition fee increase.</p>

<p class="BODY">There remains, however, an administrative determination, to be
yet resolved with finality by the DECS, i.e., whether the petitioner really
deserves to be in the senior class, as he claims, or has a number of school
deficiencies to overcome, as the respondent school counters.  Hence, the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus</i>
at this time would not be warranted.  We
have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">repeatedly said that for a writ of
<i>mandamus</i> to issue, a petitioner should, on the one hand, have a clear
legal right to the thing </span>demanded, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
there should be, upon the other hand, an imperative duty of a respondent to
perform the act sought to be mandated.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> This Court, not being a trier of facts,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
