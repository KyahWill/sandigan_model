<p class="BODY">On 15 June 1986, Yanky Hardware Company, Inc. ("Yanky")
applied for and was granted by BA Finance Corporation ("BA Finance"),
a credit accommodation in the form of a discounting line under which the former
could from time to time discount with, and assign its trade receivables to, BA
Finance.  To secure the payment of all
loans obtained or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be

its stock-in-trade or merchandise inventory in favor of BA Finance.  To guarantee those loans, Antonio Ngui Yek
Siem, President and General Manager of Yanky, executed a continuing suretyship
agreement</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> in favor of BA Finance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On various occasions, Yanky drew on that credit accommoda­tion
and executed in favor of BA Finance separate deeds of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">assignment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In time, BA Finance demanded from Yanky the payment of its
accumulated obligations which, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>of
20 October 1981, had alle<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">g</span>edly
reached the amount of P559,565.00, or the delivery of the mortgaged chattels
for pur<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">p</span>oses of extrajudicial
foreclosure.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 October 1981, BA Finance filed with the then Court of First
Instance ("CFI") a com<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">p</span>laint
against Yanky and Antonio Ngui Yek Siem for replevin with damages or, in the
alternative, payment of the amount of P559,565.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">p</span>lus interest.  BA Finance
contended that it had the right to take possession of the chattels described in
the chattel mortgage or to be paid the total amount of the loans plus interest
since Yanky had breached the conditions of the chattel mortgage by failing to
pay the amounts secured thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 October 1981, the CFI ordered the seizure of all the
merchandise inventories and other personal properties described in the chattel
mortgage.  Sheriff Rolando Balingit
accordingly seized chattels found in the premises of Yanky and later transferred
these to BA Finance's warehouse.  Balingit submitted a sheriff's receipt<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
dated 26 October 1981 containing a list of the properties seized, and a
sheriff's return<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
dated 4 November 1981.  But on 5
November 1981, sheriff Balingit filed another report<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
dated 5 November 1981 which according to him superseded the earlier list,
stating therein that this list was arrived at after he and some BA Finance
employees had conducted a re-inventory of the replevied chattels in BA
Finance's warehouse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yanky and Antonio Ngui Yek Siem filed an answer claiming that
since not all of their obligations were due, BA Finance had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>yet no cause of action against
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Yanky came into deep financial difficulties.  Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation
("RCBC"), China Banking Corporation ("China Bank") and
International Corporate Bank ("InterBank") intervened in the replevin
case as creditors of Yanky.  During a
pre-trial conference on 27 February 1984 RCBC moved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">for </span>the sale at public auction of the replevied chattels in
order to prevent further depreciation of their value.  BA Finance and the rest of the intervenors <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accepted</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">After having </span>been
rescheduled twice, a public auction sale <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>finally conducted on 31 April 1984 at BA
Finance's Warehouse in Epifanio de los Santos Ave., Mandaluyong, Metro
Manila.  The highest bidder was private
respondent Wilson Siy whose winning bid was P60,000.00.   After the sale, Deputy Sheriff Rodolfo P.
Torella submitted a Sheriff's Report.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">BA </span>Finance, however, moved to
cancel the auction sale on the ground that while it (BA Finance) was ready to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> bid for the auctioned properties for P150,000.00,
it had been improperly deprived of its right to participate in the  bidding by the sheriff who insisted that BA
Finance pay for its bid in cash.  BA
Finance was thus forced to put together P150,000.00 in bills and since the
counting of the bills took sometime, its representative arrived late for the </span>bidding.  The trial court cancelled<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the auction sale on the ground that the price realized was shockingly low, the
auction sale having been hastily conducted.  Later, however, this order was reconsidered by the trial court after Siy
posted a bond in the amount of P140,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Siy then filed a Motion with the trial court seeking the
production and delivery of certain chattels allegedly sold in the auction sale
but not delivered by BA Finance to him.   BA Finance countered that the chattels referred to by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Si</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">y</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>still
undelivered were those included in an inventory list attached to the sheriff's
report dated 5 November 1981, which list had not been furnished to BA Finance
prior to the auction sale and which, more importantly, according to BA Finance,
listed not only chattels replevied by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Yanky </span>but also other personalty which had
been repossessed from BA Finance's other clients.  The trial court appointed a commissioner to look into the
matter.  The first commissioner rendered
a report stating that BA Finance should produce or account for certain
undelivered personal properties.  BA
Finance and the intervenor banks opposed this report and the court disapproved
it.  A second <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">commissioner was designated by the trial court.  This commissioner similarly reported that
not all of the properties mortgaged and sold </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">BA Finance moved for reconsideration of this last order of the
trial court, without success.  On 24
September 1985, the CFI issued an order the dispositive portion of which
required BA Finance to deliver the allegedly missing chattels or their value:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, subject to the modification as stated above, the

<p class="BODY">This time, it was Siy who filed a Motion for Recon­sideration.  He contended that because BA Finance was
depository of the chattels, it should be made liable to him for damages for
having failed to deliver the chattels listed in an inventory dated 27 October
1981.  The Court issued an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">order dated 22 January 1986 which provided in
its dispositive portion as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 February 1986, i.e., twenty-three (23) days after its
receipt of the order last quoted above, BA Finance filed its notice of appeal
and a record on appeal with the CFI.  The trial court, however, in an order dated 2 June 1986, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">disapproved the notice of appeal and record
on appeal as having been filed out of time.  BA Finance's Motion for Reconsideration of this order was denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">BA Finance then went to the Court of Appeals on a Petition for <i>Mandamus</i>
and <i>Certiorari,</i> seeking to set aside the CFI's orders of 2 June 1986 and
16 July 1986.  Petitioner there urged
that the CFI order of 22 January 1986 had resolved, not the replevin case
itself but rather an incidental issue therein; that the case was one where
multiple appeals were proper; and that, therefore, the reglementary period for
appeal was thirty (30) days and not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fifteen
(15) days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals dismissed<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Petition, ruling that since the order of the CFI dated 22 January 1986 had
fully disposed of the replevin case, the applicable reglementary period for
appeal was fifteen (15) days from BA Finance's receipt of a copy of that
order.  The Court of Appeals concluded
that petitioner's notice of appeal had not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">been seasonably filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this Petition for Review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) issues are raised here:  the first relates to the character of the order of the trial court dated
22 January 1986; the second concerns the reglementary period applicable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in respect of an appeal from that order of
the trial court.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The principal case filed
by BA Finance against Yanky was, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">we </span>already
noted, for replevin, and in the alternative, collection of the amount of the
loans, plus interest, owed by Yanky to BA Finance.  Sections 9 and 10 of Rule 60 on "Delivery of Personal
Property," of the Revised Rules of Court state that:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 9.  <u>Judgment</u>.
- After <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a trial </span>of the issues
the court shall find <u>in whom is the right </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of possession</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and <u>the
value of the property</u> and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">shall</span>
<u>render judgment</u> in the alternative <u>for the delivery thereof to the
party entitled to the same</u>, or <u>for the value in case delivery cannot be
made</u>, and also for such damages as either party may prove, and for
costs."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 10.  Judgment to
include recovery against sureties. - <u>The amount, if any, to be awarded to
either pa</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">rt</span>y upon any
bond filed by the other</u> in accordance with the provisions of this rule,
shall be claimed, ascertained, and granted under the same procedure as
prescribed in section 20 of Rule 57." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The 22 January 1986 order of the trial
court merely directed BA Finance to turn over to Wilson Siy, as highest bidder
in the public sale, properties which had allegedly been sold at a public
auction but which had supposedly remained undelivered to the latter.  That order never passed upon the right of
either of the original parties, BA Finance or Yanky Hardware, to take or keep
possession of the replevied items.  That
order, moreover, did not resolve a claim by BA Finance that not all the
movables mortgaged under the chattel mortgage had in fact been replevied by the
sheriff from Yanky's premises.  Neither
did that order determine whether BA Finance was entitled to collect P559,565.00
as loans due and payable from Yanky and surety Antonio Ngui Yek Siem.  We think it clear that what had been issued
by the trial court on 22 January 1986 was <u>not</u> a judgment which disposed
of the causes of action pleaded by BA Finance or the defenses raised by Yanky
and surety Antonio Ngui Yek Siem.  Rather, that order resolved what was initially merely an incident of the
principal case but which, under the Court of Appeals’ decision, threatens to
overwhelm the parties to the original suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be recalled that Yanky's creditor banks had intervened in
the replevin case and that upon the suggestion of one of the banks, the
chattels subject matter of the replevin suit were sold to avoid further
deterioration in value pending resolution of the main case.  Respondent Wilson Siy was neither an
original party nor an intervenor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in the
replevin case; he was a total stranger vis-a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">-vis</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> the original
parties and the intervenors.  Nonetheless, we must recognize that the 22 January 1986 order of the
trial court purported to resolve the right of Wilson Siy to receive the
disputed movable properties and accordingly BA Finance's obligation to deliver
to Siy those same properties; to this limited extent, i.e., so far as concerns
the dispute between BA Finance and Wilson Siy, the trial court's order was
clearly a final one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a firmly settled rule that only a final order or judgment
on the merits may be the subject of an appeal.  A judgment on the merits is one rendered after a determination of which
party is in the right and must prevail, as distinguished from a judgment
rendered upon some preliminary or formal or merely technical point.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, after a final order or judgment, the court should have nothing
more to do in respect of the relative rights of the parties to the case.  Conversely, “an order that does not finally
dispose of the case and does not end the Court's task of adjudicating the
parties’ contentions in determining their rights and liabilities as regards
each other, but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">obviously indicates
that other things remain to be done by the Court, </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">interlocutory."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The second issue to be

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Under the above-quoted section, the
reglementary period to appeal is, not fifteen (15) days, but rather thirty (30)
days in:  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(1) appeals </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">special </span>proceedings;
and (2) "other cases wherein multiple appeals are allowed." In the
instant case, as already pointed out, the questioned order finally disposed of
the incident involving BA Finance and Wilson <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Siy </span>and his claim to certain chattels stored in BA Finance's
warehouse, but <u>not</u> the main action itself between BA Finance, Yanky
Hardware and the intervenor banks.  The
principal action itself has not yet reached the trial stage, which trial would
relate <u>not</u> to the chattels that were disposed of or allegedly disposed
of by public sale but rather to the disposition of the proceeds (or whatever
proceeds are properly due from Wilson <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Siy)
</span>of such sale, and to the alternative demand for payment of the
outstanding obligations of Yanky Hardware to BA Finance.  We believe and so hold that given the actual
circumstances of the instant case, it must be regarded as falling within the
term "other cases wherein multiple appeals are allowed".  It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">follows
that the applicable reglementary period for appeal is thirty (30) days, the
record on appeal being required since the </span><u>expediente</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the case must remain with the trial court
so that the case may proceed to trial on the merits of the claims between the
principal parties and the </span>intervenors.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note also that <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>, to prevent BA
Finance from appealing the order of the trial court dated 22 January 1986 may
result in a serious miscarriage of justice.  Private respondent Wilson Siy submitted a bid for and paid the amount of
<u>P60,000.00</u> which he presumably felt was the reasonable value of the
personal properties subjected to the public sale.  The questioned order of the trial court requires BA Finance to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">deliver </span>to Siy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>vendee in the public sale chattels
with the total estimated value of <u>P2.3 million</u> which represents a truly
extraordinary rate of return of 3,800 percent on Wilson Siy's original
investment.  This circumstance by itself
suggests that somewhere a serious mistake of fact, or an eccentric interpretation
of the terms of the chattel mortgage contract or possibly even deliberate fraud
may have vitiated the proceedings below concerning Wilson Siy's claims, to the
obvious prejudice of BA Finance, or Yanky Hardware and surety Antonio Ngui Yek
Siem, or the intervenor banks, or some or all of these.  Equitable considerations thus support <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the conclusion reached above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the interest of orderly procedure, Wilson Siy should not have
been allowed by the trial court to introject himself in the principal case by
the filing of a motion for delivery of chattels allegedly sold but undelivered
to him by BA Finance at public auction.  His proper recourse was to institute an independent suit against the
sheriff and BA Finance.  As it is, the <u>de</u>
<u>facto</u> intervention of Wilson Siy in the proceedings between BA Finance
and Yanky Hardware and the intervenor banks has already resulted in undue delay
in such proceedings.</p>
