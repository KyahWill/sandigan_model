Poblete and Florence Moyco, who were allegedly allowed to vote despite the absence of their names in the reconstituted list of voters."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The Answer also explained the circumstances which led to the first resolution of respondent Commission suspending the election only to be subsequently reconsidered thus allowing the election to take place.&nbsp; Thus: "On May 2, 1979 a fire that originated some distance away from the office of the respondent Comelec Registrar of La Carlota City burned the latter office and about half of all the commercial buildings in the City.&nbsp; As a result, all the records and equipment kept by respondent registrar in his office were destroyed, including the book and master list of registered voters in La Carlota City.&nbsp; Shortly after the fire, respondent registrar began reconstitution of the list of registered voters in the city.&nbsp; Fortunately, he had kept in his residence extra copies of a substantial portion of the official list used in the 1978 elections for the Interim Batasang Pambansa.&nbsp; What these copies lacked, he made up with the authentic copies which were furnished the barangay captains of the various barangays in the city during the elections mentioned.&nbsp; Accordingly, by the time the elections for local government officials were announced in the second week of December, 1979, respondent registrar had already fully reconstituted the destroyed master list of voters in La Carlota City.&nbsp; Immediately following the filing of petitioner Mariño of his certificate of candidacy for the position of mayor of La Carlota City, he made inquiry with the respondent registrar regarding the list of registered voters in the city.&nbsp; After being shown the reconstituted list and informed of its basis, he sent about ten of his representatives to respondent registrar for the purpose of copying his list.&nbsp; Respondent registrar allowed them to do so and the copying lasted about three days.&nbsp; Subsequently, pursuant to decrees issued by the President, a registration of voters at the voting center level took place in La Carlota City on January 19, 20, 26 and 27, 1980.&nbsp; Copies of the reconstituted list of registered voters were given to the respective citizens election committees of the voting centers on the dates mentioned for the purposes of adding to that list the names of the newly registered voters and to enable previously registered voters to verify their inclusion in the list.&nbsp; Likewise added to this list were the voters who registered directly with respondent registrar pursuant to law.&nbsp; The list, as finalized, contained the names of 24,701 registered voters.&nbsp; On the evening of January 27, 1979 as soon as the certified list of registered voters to be used in the January 30, 1980 election had been finalized in proper form, respondent registrar personally delivered a set of copies thereof to each of the political parties participating in the election as well as to the citizens election committees (two sets), through the City Superintendent of Schools.&nbsp; Other sets of copies of the voters list were sent to respondent Commission on Elections in Manila and the Provincial Election Supervisor in Bacolod City.&nbsp; The original copies of the list were retained by respondent Registrar for his file."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>More specifically, concerning the issuance of the two resolutions, it was alleged in the Answer that the Special Action Team of the respondent Commission in the Visaya and Mindanao headed by Attorney Vicente D. Gerochi, Jr. recommended the suspension of the local elections in view of the absence of what it considered "a proper voters list."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On the morning of January 29, 1980, such recommendation was favorably acted upon and a resolution to that effect was issued by respondent Commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Upon the executive session of respondent Commission being resumed at 2:00 o'clock the same day, Commissioner Flores Bayot who was unable to attend the meeting that morning, being on official business, on learning of the postponement and the reasons given by Attorney Gerochi, Jr., recommended the setting aside of the first resolution for the reason that there existed a reconstituted list of registered voters, a recommendation acted upon favorably by the Commission which thus resolved to lift its previous order postponing the election.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The second resolution was then immediately transmitted to respondent Registrar for implementation on that afternoon of January 29, 1980, with the respondent Registrar informing "the political parties concerned and, through available media, the public, of the decision to proceed with the elections in La Carlota City.&nbsp; The preparation and distribution of all election paraphernalia, including the list of registered voters, were completed on time."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>To repeat, the election was held on January 30, 1980, with the candidates of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan emerging victorious.&nbsp; As early as February 2, 1980, they were proclaimed.&nbsp; The petition itself was filed only on February 6, 1980.&nbsp; Thus, a restraining order issued by this Court came too late.&nbsp; There was a reply to the answer filed by the petitioners.&nbsp; The narration of respondents was refuted and the argument that there was no permanent list of voters nor a certified list and book of voters reiterated.&nbsp; It was likewise alleged that "said election at La Carlota City was the dirtiest as massive fraud were committed while taking advantage of such anomalous situation,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> prompting civic and religious leaders of the City to send telegram to President Ferdinand E. Marcos as well as to then Chairman Leonardo Perez of the Commission on Elections praying for the annulment of the election.&nbsp; It is worth noting that notwithstanding the fact that the restraining order proved ineffective as the proclamation had been made, there was no amendment of the prayer in the Reply submitted.&nbsp; It merely repeated what was stated in the petition.&nbsp; All that was asked was that the election as well as the election result be declared null and void and that respondent Commission set a date for a new election.&nbsp; That was all.<br><br>There was clearly lack of regularity in preparing the list of voters.&nbsp; In that sense, a complaint against what was done by respondent Commission is not unjustified.&nbsp; Nonetheless, such a failing was cured by the fact that in the last May 14, 1984 elections for the Batasang Pambansa, the situation must have been remedied.&nbsp; Moreover, with the lapse of time and the next local elections, being barely a year away, no useful purpose would be served by pursuing the matter further.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that respondent Commission could have exerted greater diligence on the matter, the fire having occurred as far back as May 2, 1979.<br><br>It would thus appear that the meaningful issue now is whether or not, considering the contradictory claims as to how the election was conducted, petitioner as the defeated candidate for Mayor could still pursue an election protest.&nbsp; That question, in the light of the previous decisions of this Court, must be answered in the affirmative.&nbsp; This Court, in a host of decisions impressive for their number and unanimity, has made clear that there is no surer way of determining the choice of the people for an elective position than to allow a protest in an appropriate case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Considering the allegation as to the manner the January 30, 1980 elections was conducted in La Carlota City, this is one of them.&nbsp; A respect for the constitutional right of suffrage mandates that petitioner should be afforded that remedy.&nbsp; The law, especially its equitable aspect, would be satisfied with nothing less.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed without prejudice to petitioner filing a protest, within a period of ten days from receipt of this decision, if so minded.&nbsp; This decision is immediately executory.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Aquino, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr., De La Fuente, Cuevas</i>, and <i>Alampay, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Teehankee</i> and <i>Abad Santos, JJ.</i>, dissent in separate opinions.<br><i>Concepcion, Jr., Escolin</i>, and <i>Makasiar, JJ </i>, are on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The other petitioner is Zenaida Jamandre Nessia, in her capacity as a registered voter in La Carlota City.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The other respondent is the City Registrar of La Carlota City.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Petition, Annex C.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, Prayer, 10.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, par. 9.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, par. 10.&nbsp; In this paragraph, reference was likewise made to a Book of Voters and a Permanent List of Voters.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Answer, par. 27.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, par. 25.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, par. 26.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Ibid,</i> pars. 16-20.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, par. 21.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, par. 22.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, pars. 22-23.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>, par. 24.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Petitioner's Reply, 3.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Some of the cases follow:&nbsp; Venezuela v.
