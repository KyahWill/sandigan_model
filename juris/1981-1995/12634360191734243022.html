HON. JAPAL M. GUIANI, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT
BRANCH 14, COTABATO CITY AND DELA VIDA INSTITUTE REPRESENTED BY MS. JOSEPHINE

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The subject of this litigation revolves around two (2) parcels of
adjoining lots owned by petitioners which are the proposed extension sites of
De La Vida Institute, an educational institution located in Cotabato City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 26, 1991, the petitioners and private respondent entered
into a contract to sell under which terms, private respondent, as president of
De la Vida Institute, assured petitioners that they would buy the said
properties on or before July 31, 1991 in the amount of P1,750,000.00.  In the meantime, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">petitioners surrendered the physical
possession of the two lots to private respondent who promptly built an edifice
worth </span>P800,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But on July 31, 1991, the sale did not materialize.  Consequently, petitioners filed a complaint
for unlawful detainer against private respondent (MTCC Civil Case No.
2739).  In retaliation, private
respondent filed a complaint for reformation of the contract to sell executed
on April 26, 1991 (Civil Case 592).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Afterwards, the parties met to settle their differences.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 6, 1992, the parties entered into a compromise
agreement which stipulated among others that petitioners would give private
respondent five (5) months to raise the amount of P2,060,000.00;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that in the event of failure to raise the said amount within the designated
period, private respondent would vacate the premises immediately.  The compromise agreement, inter alia,
provided:</p>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>that upon the execution of this agreement, the
defendant will furnish the plaintiff with xerox copy of the land title for each
lot which the latter may use for the purpose of providing information <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">in securing a loan from any financing
or banking institution of their choice.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">  7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that if within the
period of </span>five (5) months from and after February 6, 1992, the plaintiff
succeeds in obtaining funds for the purpose of settling their obligations with
defendants in the total sum of P2,060,000.00 the latter shall oblige themselves
to execute, sign and deliver to the former the corresponding Deed of Sale for
the two (2) lots which is the subject of this case and turn-over to said
plaintiff the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">owner's
duplicate copy of TCT Nos. T-22004 and T-22005 of the Registry of Deeds for the
City of Cotabato."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In affirmation of the compromise agreement, the Board of Trustees
of De La Vida College passed thereafter a resolution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">expressing full support to the said </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">agreement </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">entered
into between the parties.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">  On March 10, 1992,
private respondent wrote petitioners that "the compromise agreement we
have had in<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the presence of Judge Guiani
is not the same as per attached <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">xerox copy you gave us." In that
letter, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">essentially
was a counterproposal, private respondent said that the price of P2,060,000.00
was higher than what they were willing to pay in the amount of P2,000,000.00</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span>only.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

matters taken up in the letter were:  De
La Vida Institute would admit students and hold classes until July 6, 1992 but
in case they (private respondent) fail to deliver the said amount, they would
voluntarily vacate the premises and that "in the event that the bank and
other lending institutions give its nod and approval to our loan and require
the submission of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">other documents, you will give to us the Deed of Sale and
Owner's </span>copies of the Titles of the two (2) lots to expedite release of
the amount concerned."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 25, 1992, the trial court approved the compromise
agreement dated February 6, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Two (2) months after, private
respondents, alleging </span>that they had negotiated a loan from the Bank of
the Philippine Islands, wrote letters dated May 19, 20 and 26 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">requesting
petitioners to execute with them a contract to sell in their favor.  On May 28, 1992, private respondent filed
with the trial court an urgent motion for an order directing petitioners to
execute a contract to sell in private respondent's favor in accordance with
paragraph 7 of the compromise agreement</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 8, 1992, petitioners filed a motion for execution of
judgment alleging that after a lapse of five (5) months from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">February
6, 1992, private respondents have failed to settle their </span>obligations
with petitioners.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its order dated August 6, 1992, respondent judge denied the
motion for execution and directed petitioners to execute the required contract
to sell in favor of private respondent.  Respondent judge opined that the proximate cause of private respondent's
failure to comply with the compromise agreement was the refusal of petitioners
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">execute
a contract to sell as required under the agreement.  Respondent judge added that petitioners should have </span>executed
the contract to sell because anyway they would not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">be prejudiced since there was no
transfer of ownership involved in a contract to sell.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Hence this instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>, with prayer
for a temporary restraining order enjoining respondent judge from enforcing its
August 6, 1992 order.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:99.0pt">On October 7, 1992, petitioners filed an
Omnibus Urgent Motion praying that private respondent be ordered to consign
with the court below P135,000.00 representing rentals from May 1991 to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">January
1992.  In our resolution dated November
18, 1992, we granted said prayer.  On
March 9, 1993, private respondent </span>consigned with the Office of the Clerk
of Court the sum of P135,000.00.  On
March 29, 1993, petitioners filed with the lower court a motion to withdraw the
consigned amount and on April 5, 1993, the trial court released the consigned
amount to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">petitioners.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The issue in the case at bar is whether or not respondent judge
committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering petitioner to execute a
contract to sell in favor of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We dismiss the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of this case hinges on whether the compromise
agreement gives private respondent-buyer the right to demand from
petitioner-sellers the execution of a contract to sell in favor of the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, paragraph 7 of the compromise agreement does not give
such right to private respondent-buyer.  To wit:</p>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>that if within the period of five (5) months
from and after February 6, 1992, the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining funds for
the purpose of settling their obligations with defendants in the total sum of
P2,060,000.00 the latter shall oblige themselves to execute, sign and deliver
to the former the corresponding <u>Deed</u> <u>of</u> <u>Sale</u> for the two
(2) lots which is the subject of this case and turn-over to said plaintiff the
owner's duplicate copy of TCT Nos. T-22004 and T-22005 of the Registry of Deeds
for the City of Cotabato." (Underscoring provided).<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">From
the aforecited paragraph, it is clear that the seller </span>is obliged to
execute a Deed of Sale and not a Contract to Sell upon payment of the full
price of P2.06 million.  Thereafter, the
sellers would turn over to the buyers, respondents herein, the owner's
duplicate copy of Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. T-22004 and T-22005.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the
interpretation of the compromise agreement, we must delve into the
contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">parties to fathom the real intention
of the parties.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> A review </span>of
the facts reveals that even prior to the signing of the compromise agreement
and the filing of Civil Case No. 592 before the trial court, the parties had
already entered into a contract <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">to sell.  Thereafter, when the transaction failed to materialize, the parties
filed suits against each other; petitioners, their </span>unlawful detainer
case, and private respondent a complaint for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">reformation of contract, alleging
that petitioners in fact had caused the preparation of the contract to sell
dated April 26, 1991 with the understanding that the land would be used as a
collateral in obtaining a loan with DBP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said contract to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sell </span>was
superseded by the compromise agreement entered into on February 6, 1992
containing the abovequoted paragraph.  It must be recalled that private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">respondent was given five (5) months from
February 6, 1992, i.e., </span>on or before July 6, 1992 to secure the purchase
price of the two (2) lots.  We note that
within the time frame agreed upon by the parties, private respondents wrote
three (3) letters dated May 19, 20 and 26 requesting petitioners to execute a
contract to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">sell
in its favor.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under these factual circumstances, we opine that the compromise agreement
must be interpreted as bestowing upon private respondent-buyer the power to
demand a contract to sell from petitioner-sellers.  Where the seller promised to execute a deed of absolute sale upon
completing payment of the price, it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">a contract to sell.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> In the
case at bar, the sale is still in the executory stage since the passing of
title is subject to a suspensive condition, namely, that if private respondent
is able to secure the needed funds to be used in the purchase of the two </span>(2)
lots owned by petitioners.  A mere
executory sale, one where the sellers merely promise to transfer the property
at some future date, or where some conditions have to be fulfilled before the
contract is converted from an executory to an executed one, does not pass ownership
over the real estate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">being sold.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In our jurisdiction, it has been held that an accepted bilateral
promise to buy and sell is in a sense similar to, but not exactly the same, as
a perfected contract of sale because there is already a meeting of minds upon
the thing which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">is the object of the contract and upon the price.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> But a </span>contract
of sale is consummated only upon delivery and payment.  It cannot be denied that the compromise
agreement, having been signed by both parties, is tantamount to a bilateral
promise to buy and sell a certain thing for a price certain.  Hence, this gives the contracting parties
rights <u>in</u> <u>personam</u>, such that each has the right to demand from
the other the fulfillment of their respective undertakings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Demandability may be exercised <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">at any time after the execution of the
Deed.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The order of respondent judge directing petitioners to issue a
contract to sell does not place petitioners in any danger of losing their
property without consideration, for, to repeat, in a contract to sell there is
no immediate transfer of ownership.  In
contracts to sell, payment is a positive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">suspensive condition, failure of which does
not constitute a breach but an event that prevents the obligation of the vendor
to </span>convey title from materializing, in accordance with Article 1184 of
the Civil Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners as promisors were never obliged to convey title before the
happening of the suspensive condition.  In fact, nothing stood in the way of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">their selling the property to
another after an unsuccessful </span>demand for said price upon the expiration
of the time agreed upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the period given by petitioners under the compromise
agreement has already lapsed, we order the trial court to fix anew a period
within which private respondents could secure the needed funds for the purchase
of the land.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, considering that private respondents have only consigned rentals from
May 1991 to January 1992 and have since accepted students for the present
school year, it is only proper that they be ordered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">to deposit the monthly rentals
collected thereafter with the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is DISMISSED.  Petitioners are hereby ordered to EXECUTE a
contract to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">sell </span>in favor of
private respondents.  On the other hand,
private respondent is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
