				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The procedural due process objection was the basis for this <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner alleged that without the hearing required, the amendment
sought, which was considered as uncontested, as granted by respondent Public
Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the private
respondents therein named<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
were allowed "to operate their taxicabs within the City of Manila and
Suburbs and from said place to any point in the Island of Luzon accessible to
motor vehicles and vice versa, but not to exceed a total of six hundred (600)
taxicab units to be apportioned to the petitioners."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
There was, in addition, a second cause of action based on the same ground that
a proposal by a second group of private respondents<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to convert a certificate of public convenience provin­cial taxicab services
into Manila and suburbs and that notwithstanding the reservation on the part of
a special counsel from the Department of Justice who reserved his right to file
an opposition in behalf of the public with the hearing being postponed so that
the case could be heard jointly with the earlier application that gave rise to
the first cause of action "without any notice to petitioner, and to other
oppositors, of any hearing subsequent to July 16, 1969, respondent Public
Service Commission, thru Commissioner Enrique Medina, on <u>July 29 1969</u>,
rendered a decision stating:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'At the
hearing of the petition, only the Association of Taxicab Operators of Manila
and Suburbs, Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc., International Transportation Co.,
Inc., Rosario C. Vda. de Monserrat and Enrique C. Monserrat, Jr. appeared at
said hearing through counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
at the last hearing, Atty. Rodolfo M. Medina withdrew the opposition in behalf
of his clients, while the others did not appear to contest this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the opposition of Ildefonso
Tambunting, it appears that it was filed <span style="">out
of time that no copy of said opposition was furnished herein petitioners; and, that
not even he nor his counsel was present when the case was called for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>With their withdrawal and
the absence and manifest lack of interest of the other oppositors, this
petition is there­fore considered as uncontested</u>.' and provides in its dispositive
part, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'In view of the foregoing
consi­derations this Commission finds that there is a public </span>need for
the regular operation of additional taxi units in the Greater Manila area; that
the grant of this petition will meet this public need; that the grant will not
pre­judice the riding public, but will on the contrary, best promote and
protect public convenience and interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the instant petition maybe, as it hereby [<span style="">G</span>ranted].'"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It was admitted by petitioner that motions for reconsideration were filed with
reference to the above assailed decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It is further the submission of petitioner that instead of the matter being
uncontested, there was insistence on his part to adduce evidence to the claim
of public respondent that there was no such necessity for the amendment and the
conversion of the certificates of public convenience.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court by resolution
required respondents to file an answer to the petition and further issued a
temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
answer filed by the principal private respondent Ricardo Silverio, it was
stressed that instead of coming directly to this Court by this <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding, the appropriate remedy would have been one of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise pointed out that on the
merits, there was no question that the action taken by respondent Public
Service Commission through the then Commissioner Josue Cadiao could not be
considered as a denial of procedural due process as there was default on the
part of petitioner Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mention was
likewise made that the Association of Taxicab Operators in Manila and Suburbs
withdrew their opposition as well as other oppositors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was subsequently an amended petition,
but reference was only made to petitioner withdrawing his motion for recon­sideration
as he sought direct relief to the Supreme Court and that there was a subsequent
amendment by the same Commissioner Cadiao in effect granting authority to
seventeen private respondents to operate 306 units of their taxicabs in
addition to the 640 units originally granted, again without any previous
hearing or notice thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
then clearly a significant legal question raised, this on the assumption that
the facts would demonstrate that the claim of petitioner was meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances, the admission by
petitioner that there was a motion for reconsideration, which ordinarily would
suffice to constitute a defense to a procedural due process objection, was not
deemed decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was considered by
this Court as deserving of further attention and scrutiny was the practice
followed by respondent Commission that could, and as petitioner pointed out,
did result in a party not being given the opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That could be viewed as an improvident
exercise of authority, stigmatized, and correctly so, as violative of the due
process clause.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The parties were duly heard, memoranda
submitted, and the case then submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, no need for ruling on the
question raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after, martial law
was declared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under a Presidential
Decree issued less than four months later, the Public Service Commission was
abolished.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It created a Board of Trans­portation in its
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, this governmental
agency has been entrusted with the functions formerly pertaining to the defunct
respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">No use­ful </span><span style="">purpose would thus be served by a decision on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Petition, par. 11, Annex O. Par. 17 of the petition reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That on October 21, 1969, an order
dated August 6, 1969, signed by Commissioner Cadiao, was filed with the
Secretary of the Commission, approving an alleged application of one Alex F. de
Guzman for the con­version of his 40 units of taxicabs from 'provincial' to
'city' thus, transferring the base of operations of said taxicabs from Malabon,
Rizal, to the City of Manila, when said Alex de Guzman is not an original
applicant in Case No. 69-2926, and which amounted to an amendment of the
decision, without any previous hearing, nor notice there­of, copy of said order
is attached here­to as Annex 'X'."</p>
