				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Bernardo Gonzales appeals from a decision of the Regional Trial
Court, Caloocan City, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
for the murder of Alberto de Guzman and to pay P30,000.00 as indemnity for
death and P10,000.00 as reimbursement for actual expenses incurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information filed against appellant alleged:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 7th day of February, 1982 at Caloocan
City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, without any justifiable cause, with deliberate
intent to kill, evident premeditation and treachery, did then and <span style="">there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously
attack, assault and stab several times with a kitchen knife on the different
parts of the body one ALBERTO DE GUZMAN y PINIANO, thereby inflicting multiple
stab wounds upon the latter which caused the death of the said victim at the
Manila Central University, this city.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Gonzales, upon arraignment, entered a plea of not
guilty, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented as its principal evidence the testimony
of three (3) witnesses, namely: (1) Myrna de Guzman who is the mother of the
victim; (2) Juliana Flores who had personally witnessed the stabbing incident;
and (3) Cpl. Paulino Batarina who had conducted an investigation and referred
the matter to the Fiscal's office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant filed a demurrer to the evidence; it was denied by the
trial court which instead afforded appellant the opportunity to adduce
evidence.  Appellant waived his right to
present evidence and never did present any.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 August 1990, the trial court rendered a decision finding
Gonzales guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as already noted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts <span style="">of </span>the
case are starkly simple and have been summarized by the Solicitor General in
the Brief for the People in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"At around 11:00 o'clock in the morning of February 7, 1982,
victim Alberto Piniano de Guzman was sleeping in the driver's seat of <span style="">a </span>passenger jeepney parked along
Katarungan Street, Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City when he was stabbed several
times by appellant.  The stabbing was
witnessed by Juliana Flores who was buying something from a store located at
the corner of Katarungan and Anonas Streets, about two full arms-length away
from the jeepney.  Flores saw appellant,
who appeared very angry, deliver the first thrust using a knife measuring about
six (6) inches long excluding the handle, on the chest of the sleeping victim
(TSN, pp. 6-8, March 12, 1990; Juliana Flores, Direct Examination).  Appellant then ran away and the victim, who
was bathed in his own blood, rushed to his own house (Id. at p. 9).  Flores knew the victim and appellant as she
was leasing a house in that area, on KKK Street, which was about 25 meters away
from the scene of the incident (Id., at pp. 6, 9).  There were other persons who witnessed the stabbing (Id., at p.
12).</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the stabbing incident happened, Myrna de Guzman was inside
their house with her younger son when her older son, the victim, with blood
oozing out from his wounds and clutching his breast, entered the house asking
for help.  The victim informed Myrna
that he was stabbed by appellant.  Myrna
knew appellant since 1963 as he was an associate of her husband in the
barangay.  Myrna brought the victim to
the Manila Central <span style="">University Hospital
aboard a tricycle.  Along the way, the
victim kept on repeating that it was appellant who stabbed him.  The victim died while undergoing surgery at
the hospital (TSN, pp. 4-5, March 14, 1990; Myrna de Guzman, Direct
Examination).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>During the trial of the case, Myrna chanced upon Juliana Flores and
asked her to testify after another eyewitness, Jaime Andaya, who had executed a
statement, failed to testify in court.  Myrna [had] met Juliana Flores, a market vendor like her, one week after
the incident and the latter informed the former that she witnessed the stabbing
(TSN, pp. 10-11, March 14, 1990).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Medical Certificate issued by the attending physician, Dr.
Gregorio Conner (Exh. 'D'), described the wounds as follows:   'multiple stab wounds, 4 cm. chin; 4 cm. left
cheek, 1.5 cm. M/3rd medial left; Anterior and posterior aspect, D/3rd, arm,
left; U/3rd int. lateral aspect, left leg; 2 cm. midsternal, 2 cm. parasternal
left 4th ICS, 2 cm. 6th ICS, AAL, left, Laceration, diaphragm 1 cm.,
hemothorax, left; Hemoperitoneum, perforation, T&amp;T, Transverse colon 0.5
cm. jejunum 0.5 cm.' (Exh. 'D', Medical Certificate, p. 21, Records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The father of the victim reported the stabbing to the police
station in Caloocan City.  The case was
referred to Cpl. Paulino Batarina for investigation.  He was not able to interview the victim since the latter was
already being operated on when he arrived at the hospital with the father of
the victim.  (TSN, pp. 2-4, March 12,
1990, Paulino Batarina, Direct Examination).  After investigation, a criminal complaint was subsequently filed against
appellant before the fiscal's office on February 11, 1982.  <span style="">However,
when policemen tried to serve the subpoena, appellant could not be found at his
residence.  Appellant was arrested only
in January, 1990 (Id. at pp. 4-5)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></sup></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since appellant Gonzales did not present evidence on his own
behalf, the instant appeal does not relate to any form of defense, but involves
only issues concerning the reliability and sufficiency of the evidence for the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant first contends that the trial court should not have
given credence to the testimony of Juliana Flores who stated that she had
witnessed the stabbing incident.  Although Juliana Flores temporarily resided in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan
City where the victim lived and was supposed to know the mother of the victim,
appellant argues, she had not revealed her knowledge of the incident until
after the lapse of a considerable period of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not persuaded because if there was any delay, it was
sufficiently explained by Juliana Flores.  She stated that she did not feel compelled immediately to inform the
relatives of the victim about her knowledge as there were other people who had
seen the stabbing anyway.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> It
has been held that eyewitnesses are commonly naturally reluctant to get
involved in criminal investigations;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> if
these eyewitnesses do not come forward immediately without delay, the fact of
delay should not, by itself, be considered as seriously affecting their
credibility.  Rather, credibility should
be assessed independently, on the basis of the substance of the testimony
offered and the surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juliana Flores had positively identified appellant Gonzales as
the person who stabbed the victim to death.  She was only two (2) arms-length away from the assailant and the victim
at that time and was quite certain of the identity of appellant as the doer of
the criminal deed.  The identificaÂ­tion
made by Juliana Flores was reinforced by the victim who, while still alive and
on the way to the hospital, had repeatedly told his mother Myrna de Guzman that
it was appellant who had assaulted him with <span style="">a </span>knife.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Gonzales, however, disputes the admission in evidence
of the <u>ante mortem</u> statement; he alleges that the evidence of record
does not indicate that that statement was made by the victim under the
consciousness of impending death.  In
its decision, the trial court noted that during the relevant period, the victim
had sustained multiple stab wounds and blood was spurting from his chest.  The degree and seriousness of the wounds and
the fact that death supervened shortly after arrival at the hospital's
operating room constitute adequate evidence that the victim must have been
aware of his impending death as he told his mother that appellant had
repeatedly knifed him as he slept.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> The
law does not require that the declarant first explicitly state his perception
of the inevitability of death as it is sufficient that from the nature and
extent of the wounds inflicted, the seriousness of his condition was so
apparent to the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A strong indication of appellant's guilt was his disappearance
from his place of residence for about eight (8) years.  As early as 11 February 1982 when the
complaint was filed before the Fiscal's Office of Caloocan City, appellant
could no longer be found in his house.  He remained at large for many years despite the issuance of several
warrants for his arrest and showed up only in 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, however, argues that flight which constitutes evidence
of guilt is disappearance from the scene of the crime and not concealment to
evade arrest.  We agree with the
Solicitor General that such a distinction makes no legal difference.  It does not really matter whether the
disappearance immediately followed the commission of the offense or a few days
afterwards when the police begin to close in on the fleeing suspect.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></sup></a>
The legal consequence would be the same because in either case, the purpose of
the fugitive is to evade responsibility for the offense committed.  It is the act of flight which is the
principal basis of inference rather than the precise proximity thereof to the
time of commission of the criminal act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant finally alleges that the trial court erred in
appreciating treachery as a qualifying circumstance.  He contends that the casual mention by Juliana Flores that the
victim was sleeping in the parked passenger jeepney when the stab wounds were inflicted,
was not sufficient to establish treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">We consider, however, that there is no further proof required in
the instant case to show that treachery had attended the commission of the
offense.  The mode of attack described
by Juliana Flores indicates that it was made suddenly and unexpectedly,
rendering the victim helpless and without opportunity to defend himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As correctly observed by the trial court, the victim was then unarmed and
oblivious of the possibility of a deadly attack as he slept on the driver's
seat of a passenger jeepney.  There was
no confrontation or altercation that preceded the attack.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant Gonzales chose that particular time to attack the victim when
retaliation or defense was not possible.  That is the very essence of treachery as a criminal law concept.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED,
save that the amount of indemnity for death payable by appellant Bernardo
Gonzales to the heirs of the victim is hereby INCREASED to P50,000.00
conformably with recent jurisprudence.</p>
