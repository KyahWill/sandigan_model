				<H3>CESAR V. ROCES, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. JOSE G. APORTADERA, RESPONDENT.<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case arose from the purported sale of a parcel of land located in Dingle, Iloilo by the late Isabel Roces to a certain Gregorio Licauan, as evidenced by a Deed of Sale, dated January 4, 1980. The document was notarized on even date by respondent Atty. Jose G. Aportadera, and contained the following subscription:<br><br>In the City of Iloilo, Philippines, this <span style="font-style: italic;">4th </span>day of January, 1980, personally appeared before me, Isabel Roces with Residence Certificate No. A-9079133 issued at Manila on February 1, 1980 known to me to be the same person who executed the foregoing instrument known as Deed of Sale, consisting of two (2) pages signed by her and and (sic) her instrumental witnesses, each and every page thereof and she acknowledged to me that the same is her true, free and voluntary act and deed."<br><br>On September 30, 1986, a verified Complaint for Disbarment was filed with this Court against respondent alleging, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, that he caused the execution of the Deed of Sale and made it appear that Isabel had participated therein by forging her signature thereon, and notarizing it through the use of a fictitious Residence Certificate. Complainant's averments were supported by the findings of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Western Visayas Regional Office. As embodied in a report, dated April 1, 1986, the NBI found that: (1) respondent admitted he notarized the deed although it was not signed by Isabel Roces in his presence, and although he knew she was hospitalized at that time; (2) handwriting examinations showed that the signature of Isabel Roces appearing in the deed is a forgery; (3) when the deed was notarized in Iloilo on January 4, 1980, Isabel Roces was confined at the Hospital de San Juan de Dios in Pasay City, and could not have personally appeared before respondent in Iloilo City; and (4) Residence Certificate No. A-9079133, listed in the subscription portion of the Deed of Sale as that presented by Isabel Roces to respondent at the time of notarization, was fictitious as it was issued on February 1, 1980, at which time Isabel Roces had already passed away.<br><br>In a Resolution, dated November 24, 1986, respondent was required by this Court to comment on the charges levied against him. He did not comply. On April 13, 1987, the case was referred to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) for investigation report and recommendation.<br><br>The OSG set the case for hearing several times, from September, 1987 through March, 1988, but these were postponed at the instance of respondent. The case was eventually transferred from the OSG to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) by virtue of this Court's Resolution, dated April 12, 1988.<br><br>On August 23, 1988, respondent received notice from the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline (National Grievance Investigation Office) of a hearing set for the afternoon of September 29, 1988. On the morning of the hearing, the IBP received a telegram from respondent requesting resetting to October 17, 1988, for the reason that he "is busy in election case as party intervenor and has hearing in People vs. Gamgam, RTC Iloilo.” The hearing officer, IBP Commissioner Ernesto L. Pineda, allowed the rescheduling "with a warning that no further postponement shall be entertained." Despite the caveat, respondent was again granted a second resetting from October 17, 1988<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to November 25, 1988.<br><br>On November 25, 1988, respondent again failed to appear before the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline. On even date Commissioner Pineda ordered the case submitted for resolution, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>.:<br><br><blockquote>"When this case was called for hearing, only the complainant appeared. The respondent, Atty. Jose Aportadera, did not appear although it was he who chose the date November 25, 1988 as the date of the hearing. His telegram to this effect is attached to the record of the case.<br><br>"This case was filed on September 30, 1986 and despite receipt by respondent of the copy of the complaint and the annexes thereto, the said respondent to date has not filed his answer. He is deemed therefore to have waived his right to file his answer.<br><br>"Considering that the complaint is supported by documentary evidence submitted by the National Bureau of Investigation consisting of 55 pages and acting upon the motion of the complainant that the case be deemed submitted for resolution, the instant case is now considered so submitted on the basis of the documentary evidence forming part of the record of the case.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote><br>Two weeks later, or on December 9, 1988, respondent moved for reconsideration of the Order by way of a telegram, which motion was opposed by complainant, through counsel. Without acting on the telegraphic motion, Commissioner Pineda, on September 4, 1989, forwarded to the IBP Board of Governors his Report finding respondent guilty of malpractice and gross negligence, and recommending his indefinite suspension from the practice of law. The Commissioner noted in the Report, dated August 28, 1989, that:<br><br><blockquote>"After going minutely over the records particularly the findings of the NBI, the following appears undisputed — <br><br>“1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject deed of sale xxx of sub-lot no. 12-C-2-B in favor of Gregorio Licauan is a FORGERY. The supposed seller, Isabel Roces did not sign the Deed of Sale.<br><br>“2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deed of sale was notarized by the respondent on January 4, 1980 at which date Isabel Roces was confined at the San Juan de Dios Hospital.<br><br>“3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of the Residence Certificate (No. A-9079133 purportedly issued at Manila on February 1, 1980) used (by) the supposed seller Isabel Roces is fictitious because the date of issue is February 1, 1980 and Isabel Roces was already dead at that time, she having died on January 21, 1980 at the San Juan de Dios Hospital. xxx<br><br>"In his Sworn Statement before the NBI Regional Director in Iloilo City, the respondent puts up the defense of lack of knowledge of the forgery of the signature of the supposed seller Isabel Roces. Thus:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="20%"><div align="LEFT">`26. </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="80%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: For your information, we have established in the course of this investigation that the signature of ISABEL ROCES appearing in the Deed of Sale dated January 4, 1980 in favor of GREGORIO LICAUAN covering Lot No. 12-C-2-B was a complete forgery.

And believing that the consideration of the sale was fully received by ISABEL ROCES or her representative."</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>"The respondent's defense of good faith is untenable.<br><br>"As a notary public, he should not have notarized the deed of sale without seeing first the signatory parties — particularly the seller — sign or affix their signatures on a serious document of conveyance of a real property.<br><br>"In the subscription part of the deed of sale, the respondent represented that Isabel Roces, '<span style="font-style: italic;">personally appeared' before him with Residence Certificate No. A-9079133</span>. As stated elsewhere, the residence certificate is fictitious.<br><br>"At the time of the notarization of the deed of sale in Iloilo City on January 4, 1980, Isabel Roces was confined at the San Juan de Dios Hospital as per the Certification of the Medical Records Clerk in said Hospital. xxx Isabel Roces died in said Hospital on January 21, 1980 per the Certification of Dra. Amalia M. Villanueva. xxx"</blockquote><br><br>On the basis of Commissioner Pineda's report and recommendation, the IBP Board of Governors, on March 26, 1994:<br><br><blockquote>"RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report of the Investigating Commissioner in the above entitled case (referring to the case at bench), herein made part of this Resolution/Decision as Annex "A"; however, after a consideration of the findings of facts, the evidence on record and the applicable law and rules, the respondent is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for TWO (2) YEARS, instead of indefinite suspension as recommended in the Report."<br></blockquote><br>A copy of the IBP Order/Decision and Commissioner Court Pineda's Report were received by this Court on June 29, 1994.<br><br>Dissatisfied with the IBP ruling, respondent, on July 15, 1994, filed a "Motion for Reconsideration and/or to Allow the Respondent to Present His Evidence." He alleged that he was not given a fair hearing or accorded due process by the IBP when the case was deemed submitted for resolution without letting him adduce his evidence. Furthermore, he averred that suspension is too harsh a penalty for his one-time infraction of the notarial law. He claims that he deserves no more than a reprimand for his actions.<br><br>After a review of the case at bench, we affirm respondent's two-year suspension.<br><br>Commissioner Pineda did not deprive respondent of his right to procedural due process in ordering the case at bench submitted for decision on November 25, 1988. His actions were in accord with the provisions of Sec. 8, Rule 139-B of the Revised Rules of Court, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 8. <span style="font-style: italic;">Investigation</span>. —&nbsp; Upon joinder of issues or upon failure of the respondent to answer, the Investigator shall, with deliberate speed, proceed with the investigation of the case. He shall have the power to issue subpoenas and administer oaths. The respondent shall be given full opportunity to defend himself, to present witnesses on his behalf and be heard by himself and counsel. However, if upon reasonable notice, the respondent fails to appear, the investigation shall proceed <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span>.<br><br>"The Investigator shall terminate the investigation within three (3) months from the date of its commencement, unless extended for good cause by the Board of Governors upon prior application.<br><br>"Willful failure or refusal to obey a subpoena or any other lawful order issued by the Investigator shall be dealt with as for indirect contempt of Court. The correspondent charge shall be filed by the Investigator before the IBP Board of Governors which shall require the alleged contemnor to show cause within ten (10) days from notice. The IBP Board of Governors may thereafter conduct hearings, if necessary, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Rule for hearings before the Investigator. Such hearing shall as far as practicable be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its commencement. Thereafter, the IBP Board of Governors shall within a like period of fifteen (15) days issue a resolution setting forth its findings and recommendations, which shall forthwith be transmitted to the Supreme Court for final action and if warranted, the imposition of penalty."</blockquote><br>The essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> There is no violation of due process even if no hearing was conducted, where the party was given a chance to explain his side of the controversy and he waived his right to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In the case at bench, respondent first failed to file his Comment to the Complaint with this Court; and then, when the case was referred to the OSG and IBP for investigation, report and recommendation, he moved to postpone and reset the hearing on the case several times over a span of more than a year. Respondent as lawyer is presumed to understand the gravity of the disbarment proceedings filed against him. His failure to ventilate his side of the controversy, inspite of all the opportunities for him to do so, constitutes a waiver by him to exercise such right.<br><br>Respondent's contention that he should have been, if at all, only reprimanded for his actions in respect of the Deed of Sale over Isabel's property deserves scant consideration. His dubious involvement in the preparation and notarization of the falsified sale of his client's property merits the penalty of suspension imposed on him by the IBP Board of Governors.<br><br>On its face, the subscription part of the questioned deed bears eloquent testimony to respondent's knowing falsification thereof, for it stated that Isabel appeared before him on <span style="font-style: italic;">January 4, 1980</span>, while it listed her Residence Certificate as having been issued on <span style="font-style: italic;">February 1, 1980</span>. Respondent's misconduct is also shown by his statement to NBI Regional Director Federico H. Opinion, Jr. on September 6, 1985, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="15%"><div align="CENTER">“15. </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="15%"><div align="CENTER">Q: </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="85%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Were you the one who prepared the Deeds of Sale executed in favor of the four buyers you mentioned? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">A: </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, your honor.

Because according to the Authority to Sell this Lot No. 12-C-2-B should be sold for P12.00 per square meter. So the Hontiveros Realty has an overprice of 6% and 10% from P4,620.00 as agreed in the Authority to Sell. After the Hontiveros Realty received the full amount of P6,930.00 and the remaining amount after deducting the commission (10%) and overprice and other expenses which amount is due to ISABEL ROCES, JOHN HONTIVEROS advised me to prepare the documents to be signed by ISABEL ROCES. So I prepared this document and considering that ISABEL ROCES was an old woman, rich and aristocratic, she seldom went to my office, but somebody instructed me instead to bring the document to her house in front of the Colegio del Sagrado, Corazon de Jesus, Iloilo City, used to do that because ISABEL ROCES had been my old client before and during this transaction. So, several days after I received this document and believing in all honesty and good faith that it is the signature of ISABEL ROCES and furthermore believing that the consideration of this sale which were received by me were turned over to Hontiveros Realty and upon advise of Hontiveros Realty, I notarized this document. With respect to the three other Deeds of Sale, believing to be the true signatures of ISABEL ROCES, I notarized them after I was advised by Hontiveros Realty.
