the hands of four <span style="">(4) </span>persons who
attacked him with bamboo spears <i><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">guhi</span>)</span></i><span style="">, </span>bows
and arrows, and big stones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
post-mortem examination disclosed that he had sustained seventeen (17) assorted
wounds, abrasions and fractures.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the assault, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>
was with his wife, <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>, and two sons, Ramon and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> identified the assailants as her own brothers, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>, Oscar, <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> and Andres <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A like
identification was also made by her sons, Ramon and Antonio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due preliminary proceedings, the four

<span class="SpellE">Albay</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
with the felony of murder, attended by evident premeditation and taking
advantage of superior strength.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances of the killing were detailed before the Trial
Court by said <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>
-- the defendants' sister and their victim's widow -- and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felomina's</span> son by the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to these
eyewitnesses, at the time of the assault on Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>,
he, his wife, <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span>, and their two sons, Ramon and
Antonio, were on their way to the home of the <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Barangay</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>Captain at <i><span style="">barrio</span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Polangui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had
arrived in <span class="SpellE">Polangui</span> at mid-morning of that day,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
having taken the bus from <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>, and had forthwith
proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Polangui</span> Municipal Building to
report an incident that had occurred the day before <span style="">-? </span>concerning Ramon, the son of the deceased Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>, who was chased by the latter's brothers-in-law (his
wife's brothers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>) and his father-in-law (his wife's
father:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been advised, however, to make their
report directly to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain of <i><span style="">barrio</span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span>, which was the place where
Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> and his children were residing, the <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> family had then taken a tricycle to go to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain, intending to avoid passing by the houses
of the <span class="SpellE">Peñoneses</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But as fate would have it, one of the tricycle's tires went flat before
they could reach their destination, so they had to go the rest of the way on
foot, and perforce pass by the houses of the <span class="SpellE">Peñoneses</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the <span class="SpellE">Oronans</span> neared the house of
Oscar <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> and
Andres <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> suddenly emerged from a grove of <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">palomaria</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>trees and blocked their path.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two were armed with bamboo spears <i><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">guhi</span>)</span></i><span style="">, </span>large stones, and bolos sheathed in
scabbards at their waists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Oronans</span> then heard a voice from behind them say,
"Fight them!" They turned and saw that behind them were two other <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> brothers, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> and Oscar,
armed with bows and arrows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two
suddenly loosed their arrows at Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arrows hit Tomas in the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tomas tried to run towards the house of Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, his father-in-law, but Andres hurled a large stone
at him, hitting the chest and causing him to stumble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> thereupon
stabbed Tomas with his bamboo spear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
four brothers then joined in the attack on Tomas, inflicting more injuries on
him with their weapons until he expired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> tried to go to her husband's defense
but was pushed away by her brother, Andres <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tomas' corpse was brought by his attackers to
the home of Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, and left in the yard.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying in their defense, three (3) of the accused brothers --
Oscar, <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> and Andres <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>
-- told the Trial Court they could not have committed the crime because on the
day and at the time of its commission, they were in another place, San Antonio,
<span class="SpellE">Buhi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, harvesting <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in a field
of which Andres was a tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
while they were thus engaged that Andres <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, <span style="">Jr. </span>came and told them of the slaying
of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They immediately decided to go to <span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left San Antonio at about 10:00 o'clock
that morning and walked all the way to <span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span>, a
distance of four kilometers or so, arriving there at around 12 o'clock noon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In corroboration of their alibi, they presented two
witnesses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bronzal</span> (father-in-law of Oscar <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>)
and one <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Ramos.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth brother charged with the crime, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, also took the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed self-defense and defense of
relative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he was then
in the house of his father (Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>), starting a
fire in the kitchen stove to cook lunch; and while he was thus occupied he
heard the voice of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>, his brother-in-law;
Tomas was shouting that he would kill Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> (<span class="SpellE">Efren's</span> father) and was calling for him to come out of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
looked out and saw that his sister, <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span>, was
with Tomas, her husband, together with four of their children, <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span>, Ramon, <span class="SpellE">Poldo</span> and
Antonio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
says he also saw that his father, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
was at the porch, and that he heard <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> tell
Tomas to go into the house and attack <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tomas did so and struck out at <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with a bolo but failed to hit him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
ran to the kitchen and placed himself behind his son, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>
followed and again struck out with his bolo, this time at <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span> however
shifted away from the blow and thus avoided being hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span> picked up a
piece of firewood and hit Tomas with it, causing the latter to stagger and drop
the bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Tomas was staggering from
the force of the blow, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> saw that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> had a dart which he hurled at <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> grabbed
Tomas and used him as a shield, so the dart hit Tomas instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span> released
Tomas and picked up another piece of firewood which he cast at Ramon, who ran
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
saw that Tomas was trying to pick up the bolo he had dropped; so with his
firewood club, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> struck Tomas again and again,
and yet again until Tomas ceased to move.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span> then went to the residence of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Councilman Roberto <span class="SpellE">Novales</span>
and surrendered to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an attempt to bolster <span class="SpellE">Efren's</span> story,
the defense also presented Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, <span class="SpellE">Efren's</span> father, and a certain Roberto <span class="SpellE">Madrilejos</span>
as witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It rejected as unworthy of credence the evidence tending to establish
the alibi of Oscar, <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> and Andres <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, and the claim of self-defense of <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>, and ruled that the
proofs of the prosecution established their guilt beyond reasonable doubt of
the crime of murder, qualified by abuse of superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there being no mitigating nor
aggravating circumstances -- the Trial Court also having found that there was
no sufficient evidence of the modifying circumstance of <span style="">evident </span>premeditation set out in the indictment -- the Court
sentenced all said accused to suffer the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>together with all its accessory
penalties, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, jointly and severally,
in the amount of P20,000.00 as compensatory damages for death, P20,000.00 as
moral damages, and P10,000.00 as exemplary damages, as well as to pay the

surrendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the defense of alibi, well established and of
unvarying application is the rule that it is unavailing against positive
identification of <span style="">the accused by
credible witnesses,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or absent a satisfactory showing of the
physical impossibility of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> being present
at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Tested by these jurisprudential standards, the defense of alibi
must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A leisurely walk of two
hours, according to the three brothers invoking that defense, is all that it
takes to travel from barrio <st1:city><st1:place>San Antonio</st1:place></st1:city>,
where they claimed they were, to barrio <span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span>,
where the killing of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> was
perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, one of their own
witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> <span class="SpellE">Bronzal</span>,
estimated the time at only an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot therefore be concluded that under the circumstances it was physically
impossible for the brothers to go from San Antonio to <span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span>,
kill their brother-in-law, and then immediately return to San Antonio before
their absence could be noticed, specially considering that they were the only
people in the field or farm in San Antonio where they were supposedly engaged
in harvesting <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, moreover, the positive identification made of them by
their own sister of the full-blood, and her son, their nephew, in addition to
the detailed narration of the manner by which they and their other brother, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>, had attacked and slain Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That positive identification -- not to
mention the telling circumstance that it was made <span style="">by relatives </span>who, because of the closeness of their
consanguineous relationship would not, in the very nature of things, be
expected to implicate them for so horrible a crime as murder and expose them to
the grave penalty thereto attached by law, if said relatives were not otherwise
certain of the veracity and accuracy of their perceptions or were plagued by
even the smallest doubt respecting them -- precludes sustaining the three
brothers' defense of alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>'
contention that he acted in legitimate defense of his person and of his father,
Leon, this Court feels that the same was correctly rejected by the Trial
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having admitted that he had
clubbed Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> to death, it behooved <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> to demonstrate, by preponderance of evidence, the
presence of the familiar elements of self-defense and defense of stranger, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>unlawful aggression on the part of
the victim, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>; lack of sufficient
provocation on <span class="SpellE">Efren's</span> part, as the person making the
defense; and reasonable necessity of the means adopted by him to repel the
aggression.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trouble is that an objective appraisal of his own proofs as
to the manner of the killing of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>,
immediately provokes and impels repudiation; for said proofs disclose an
irreconcilable inconsistency between his story and evidence of so high an order
as to be well nigh conclusive, i.e., evidence of the wounds and injuries
inflicted on Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> disclosed by the
post-mortem examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>' story that he had <i><span style="">clubbed Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>
to death</span></i><span style=""> </span>in the
process of defending himself and his father against the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
wild assault with a bolo, is obviously untrue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is contradicted by the nature and number of the deceased's
injuries:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no less than seventeen (17)
different wounds, abrasions and fractures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These <span style="">wounds and injuries
indubitably prove that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> was not only
struck four or five times with a wooden club by just one person, but was
subjected to heavy blows and stabbing with pointed objects by more than one
person, a proposition entirely consistent with the prosecution's version of the
tragic occurrence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, the claim of
self-defense would appear to be a mere afterthought on the part of <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not make the claim of self-defense or
defense of relative when he allegedly surrendered to a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
official, or when he was taken into custody by the police, which would have
been the natural and logical reaction of a person in his predicament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This omission makes his subsequent assertion
of the defense in court suspect, as this Court has had occasion to observe.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an effort to undermine
the Trial Court's fundamental conclusions, the charge is made that Ramon and <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> are biased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their disqualification as witnesses, or a
refusal to give credence to their testimony cannot, to be sure, result merely
from their being the surviving son and widow of the victim and therefore,
interested in the outcome of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For under the rules of evidence, neither parties "nor other persons
interested in the outcome</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of a case" are excluded as witnesses.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> More than once has this Court held </span>that
<span style="">mere relationship to a party cannot
militate against the credibility of a witness or be taken as destructive of the
witness' credibility, for it is not to be lightly supposed that relatives of
the victim would callously violate their conscience by blaming the crime on
persons whom they know to be innocent.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense sought to prove that the <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span>
had a motive to testify falsely against the <span class="SpellE">Peñoneses</span>
because her father and a brother had earlier tried to manhandle her son, and
she herself and her son had been haled to court for grave threats by Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsumed in
this submittal is the theory that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> had
gone to the place of residence of Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> and
his four (4) sons, bringing with him his wife and four (4) children, to launch
an attack against Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A more foolhardy
"bearding of lions" can scarcely be imagined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proffered scenario is also quite
improbable:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the mere chasing of
Tomas' son by Leon <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> would be considered so
grievous an affront as to provoke Tomas to make a rash attempt against Leon's
very life; and, as stressed by the Solicitor General, that after grappling with
and bludgeoning Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> to death, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> "was <i><span style="">unscathed</span></i><span style=""> </span>while the alleged aggressor (Tomas)
sustained fourteen (14) injuries." Moreover, the hypothesis is in
contradiction with the clear indication in the record of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan's</span> peaceful bent at the time, for the undisputed fact
is that he had traveled to <span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span> to report, as
he did report, to the police authorities there the incident involving his son
and the latter's grandfather.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants next make a half-hearted attempt in their brief to
persuade this Court to reject <span class="SpellE">Felomina's</span> testimony
because tainted by inconsistencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
do not however bother to particularize the inconsistencies or explain in what
way they detract from <span class="SpellE">Felomina's</span> credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is satisfied of the correctness of
the Trial Court's observation that any inconsistencies "between what was
stated in the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>, taken at the
police headquarters of <span class="SpellE">Polangui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>,
and her oral declarations on the witness stand * * are not substantial,"
and do not affect her credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, her narrative is fully corroborated on all substantial points by that
of her son, Ramon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Photographs depicting the lifeless victim and a police
investigator at the scene of the crime, (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. B and
B-1) were shown to <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> and her son, Ramon, in
the course of their testimony and as part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They identified the corpse, and the place
where he was lying, as they were eminently qualified to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed by the appellants however that
it was error for the Trial Court to have admitted the photographs in evidence,
because the photographer had not been presented for cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pictures were not presented as
independent evidence, but merely as part of the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> and Ramon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And since the photographer obviously was not more competent than either <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span> or Ramon to identify and describe the persons
(living or dead) and things appearing in the pictures, there was therefore no
need to present the photographer himself; questions regarding the identity and
description of the persons and things in the photographs, and even as regards
any seeming inconsistency between the photographs and the persons and things
actually photographed could very well be asked of <span class="SpellE">Felomina</span>
or Ramon as of the photographer.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the appellants' motion for new trial, its denial by
the Trial Court was correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion
was grounded on newly discovered evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is obvious that the evidence -- the testimony of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> official to whom <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> had supposedly surrendered -- ­cannot in any sense
be considered newly discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
known to the appellants during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Much less may it be considered of so substantial a character as would "change
the judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
For even if it be conceded that <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñones</span> had indeed given himself up to that <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> official, this circumstance would not alter the
outcome one bit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The manner of the commission of the crime by the four (4)
appellants establishes the existence of a conspiracy among them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as the Trial Court states, the
aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation may not be appreciated
against them absent any proof "as to how and when the plan to kill was
hatched or what time elapsed before it was carried out **.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength, alleged in the
information, was correctly found to be attendant on the perpetration of the
slaying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"** There are four accused in this case, who relatively are of
regular, medium built (build) and size.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two were armed with '<span class="SpellE">guhi</span>' (piece of bamboo,
sharpened or pointed at one end) and stone and the other two with Indian
arrows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four were carrying bolos
inside a scabbard and tied to the waist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The person attacked, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span>, was
unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he had companions, the
latter did not do anything to help the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances **, it is doubtful whether these companions
could do anything even if they attempted to help the victim considering that
the attackers were four and fully armed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The violence and force used by the four accused were excessive and out
of proportion to the means of defense available to the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier observed **, the purpose of the <span class="SpellE">Oronans</span> in going to <span class="SpellE">Kinuartelan</span>
was not to seek trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were there
to settle things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To find out why Ramon <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> was chased by his uncle and his grandfather the day
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If otherwise, they should not
have requested for a police as a companion." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court required the appellants to indemnify the heirs of
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oronan</span> in the amount of only P<span style="">30,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>This should be increased to P50,000.00 in line with current
doctrine.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Regional Trial Court
subject of the appeal at bar, being in accord with the facts and the applicable
law, is AFFIRMED <i>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></i>, with the sole
modification above indicated, that the indemnity to the heirs is increased to
FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00).</p>
