set aside Administrative Order No. 122 of the Office of the President, finding
the petitioner guilty of dishonesty and meting upon her, after appreciating
certain mitigating circumstances in her favor, the penalty of reprimand with a
warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with
more severely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President affirmed
Assignment Order No. 58/88 dated April 27, 1988 of the Secretary of Foreign
Affairs recalling the petitioner to the home office from her post as permanent
representative to the Philippine Mission to the United Nations and other
International Organizations (MISUNPHIL, for short) in Geneva, Switzerland (pp.
84-99, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Rosalinda de <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>-Santos, a
career service officer with the rank of Chief of Mission II and Ambassador
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, was appointed on July 24, 1986, by her
Excellency, President Corazon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, to the
position of Permanent Representative of the Philippines to the Philippine
Mission to the United Nations and other International Organizations with
station in Geneva, Switzerland (Annexes A and B, pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1987</st1:date>,
petitioner sought a leave of absence from the Department of Foreign Affairs
(DFA) to spend the Easter Holidays in <st1:place><st1:city>New York</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, with her mother,
brothers and sisters at no expense to the Government (p. 84, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She bought
two (2) non-transferable, non-refundable discounted tickets costing SFr.1,597
for herself and her adopted daughter <span class="SpellE">Pia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before they could leave <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>,
petitioner received instructions from the home office directing her to proceed
to <st1:city><st1:place>Havana</st1:place></st1:city> as a member of the
Philippine delegation to the UNCTAD G-77 Preparatory Conference from <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="4"><u>April</u> <u>20-26,</u> <u>1987</u></st1:date>

trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annexes C and D, pp. 35-37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.) Instead of buying an economy roundtrip ticket, she
used for the Geneva-New York-Geneva portion of her trip the two (2) discounted
tickets costing only SFr.1,597 for herself and her daughter <span class="SpellE">Pia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>
for <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> en route to <st1:city><st1:place>Havana</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, the DFA approved her
application for a leave of absence with pay from April 27 to <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1987</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>.).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the Havana Conference, she and her daughter spent her
vacation leave in <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> before
returning to <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city> (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of claiming reimbursement for SFr.2,996, she requested,

to <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>, and <st1:state><st1:place>New

portion of her trip, thereby effecting savings of<b><span style=""> </span></b>SFr.1,399 for the Government (p. <span style="">35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1987</st1:date>,
the DFA sent her a cable (GE-202/87) requesting clarification on “why <st1:city><st1:place>Mission</st1:place></st1:city>
paid for plane ticket of infant <span class="SpellE">Pia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>-Santos (petitioner’s daughter) <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>-<st1:state><st1:place>New

per CV 216/87 when she was not authorized to accompany her adopting mother at
government expense.” (<u>Ibid</u>.)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner replied that the airfare tickets were for her only and
did not include her daughter whose trip was paid from her personal funds (p.
86, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 21, 1987, the DFA required her to refund the amount
representing her daughter’s round-trip ticket since DFA received a copy of the
“facture” from the travel agency showing that the amount of SFr.1,597 was <span style="">in </span>payment of (a) 1 billet <span class="SpellE">adulte</span>-Geneva/New York/Geneva SFr.950, and (b) 1 billet
enfant-Geneva/New York/Geneva SFr.673; and that the sum of SFr.673 represented
the cost of her daughter’s portion of the ticket (p. 86, <u>Ibid</u>.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of refunding only the sum of Sfr.673 to the Government,
petitioner returned the full amount of SFr.1,597 (Annex E, pp. 38 and 86, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
thereafter claimed payment for one round-trip economy plane ticket (<st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>-<st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state>-<st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>)
in the amount of SFr.2,996 to which she was entitled under the Foreign Service
Personnel Manual on Travel, Per Diems and Daily Allowance Abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1987</st1:date>,
Deputy Armando <span class="SpellE">Maglaque</span>, and some MISUNPHIL employees
filed administrative charges against her for “incompetence; inefficient;
corrupt and dishonest activities; rude and uncouth manners; abusive and
high-handed behavior; irregular and highly illegal transactions involving funds
of the mission.” The charges were referred to Ambassador Luis <span class="SpellE">Ascalon</span> for initial investigation (Comment, p. 182, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
explained the circumstances of the purchase of the discounted tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1987</st1:date>, Ambassador <span class="SpellE">Ascalon</span> submitted
his findings which, with the complaints, were referred to a 5-man <u>Ad</u> <u>Hoc</u>
Investigation Committee for preliminary investigation (p. 86, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Committee found a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case against petitioner for (1)
dishonesty; (2) violation of existing rules and regulations; (3) incompetence
and inefficiency; and (4) conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the
service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ambassador Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> also charged
her with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> before the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was dismissed for insufficiency of
evidence (p. 87, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1987</st1:date>,
DFA recalled her to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> for
consultation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came home on <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1987</st1:date> (p. 86, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1988</st1:date>,
the Board of Foreign Service Administration (BFSA) constituted a new 5-man
investigating committee to evaluate the evidence presented by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three (3) members of the committee, (Atty. Pineda and Ambassadors
<span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> and <span class="SpellE">Garrido</span>) found
her liable for <u>misconduct</u> only, and recommended dismissal of the other
charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also recommended that she
be reprimanded and recalled to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ambassador <span class="SpellE">Arague</span>
dissented with respect to the penalty, which he thought should include a
six-month suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. De Vera
found <u>all</u> <u>the</u> <u>charges</u> against Ambassador de <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>-Santos <u>“to</u> <u>be</u> <u>unmeritorious</u>.”
(pp. 87-88, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The BFSA met <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1988</st1:date> to consider the memorandum-report
of the new Investigating Committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1988</st1:date>, the BFSA, through its
Chairman, Undersecretary Jose D. Ingles, submitted a memorandum to the
Secretary of Foreign Affairs (SFA), adopting the findings and recommendations
of the investigating committee.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter-decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1988</st1:date> (p. 50, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
the Secretary <span style="">of<i> </i></span>Foreign
Affairs affirmed the <span class="SpellE">BFSA’s</span> recommendation <span style="">declaring Ambassador de <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>-</span>Santos
guilty of the lesser offense of <u>misconduct,</u> <u>instead</u> <u>of</u> <u>dishonesty</u>,
meted to her the penalty of <u>reprimand</u>, and recalled her to the <span style="">home office.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner filed a motion
for reconsideration on </span>the ground that she was denied due process when
she was declared guilty of misconduct although it was not one of the charges
against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conceding that point, the
Secretary ordered the records remanded to the BFSA for hearing to give <span style="">petitioner an opportunity to defend herself
against the charge of misconduct which was deemed to have been filed by the
Secretary himself since an administrative complaint can be initiated directly
by the Department Head (Sec. 37[b], P.D. 807) (p. 91, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Insisting that no formal charge of misconduct had been filed
against her, and that hence, there was nothing to investigate (p. 91, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), petitioner refused to attend the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, in his resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1988</st1:date>, Secretary <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span> declared his decision of <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1988</st1:date>, “final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
effective immediately.” (Annex Q, p. 72, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed that resolution to the Office of the
President, where it was docketed as O.P. Case No. 3903 (p. 91, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1989</st1:date>,
President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> nominated <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span>
L. <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span> as Ambassador and Permanent Representative
to the United Nations and other International Organizations in <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>
in lieu of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
nomination was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1989</st1:date> (pp. 191, 224, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1989</st1:date>,
President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> issued Administrative Order No. 122
(Annex S, pp. 84-99, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) finding petitioner guilty
<span style="">of<i> </i></span>dishonesty (instead of
misconduct) and imposed upon her the penalty of reprimand, with recall to the
home office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of dishonesty was based on:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certification which was made in support of
her request for reimbursement of the discounted round-trip ticket stating that
“she purchased the said round trip ticket, which consists of two (2) <u>one-way</u>
tickets (instead of two <u>roundtrip</u> tickets), one from Geneva to New York
and the other from New York to Geneva, as shown in the attached receipt
(‘quittance’) of payment to the travel agency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, she was reimbursed, per Check No. UBS-4455589 dated <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1987</st1:date>.” (p. 95, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation in her telex ZGE-373-87 (in
answer to DFA cable of September 16, 1987) that the Geneva Mission “never paid
for the trip of Ambassador de <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>­-Santos’ daughter
to Mexico which was paid from ambassador’s personal fund” (although the DFA in
fact refunded <span class="SpellE">Pia’s</span> portion of the discounted
round-trip tickets from Geneva-New York-Geneva).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 95, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration and a supplemental
memorandum and letter addressed to the President (Annexes X, Y and Z, pp.
146-265, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1990</st1:date> (Annex AA, pp. 166-167, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
respondent Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>, Jr., by authority of the President, denied the
motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time she filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i>
alleging that the President’s “reprimand and recall orders are not supported by
substantial evidence and were issued with gross abuse of discretion and serious
error of law” (p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition has merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that the factual findings of administrative
agencies are binding on this Court and controlling on the reviewing authorities
if supported by substantial evidence (Planters Products, Inc. vs. NLRC, 169
SCRA 328; <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> vs. Ministry of National Defense,
169 SCRA 448).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts of justice will
not interfere with purely administrative matters rendered by administrative
bodies within the scope of their power and authority (<span class="SpellE">Gegare</span>
vs. CA, 177 SCRA 471).</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the records fails to yield any evidence of
dishonesty on the part of the petitioner, or an intent to cheat and defraud the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her failure to disclose the
fact that her discounted tickets included the fare for her child, was harmless
and inconsequential as the two (2) discounted Geneva-New York-Geneva tickets <span style="">for </span>herself and her daughter were in
fact inseparable, <span class="SpellE">intransferable</span>, non-<span class="SpellE">cancellable</span> and non-refundable, in effect one whole fare
only,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for purposes <span style="">of </span>the discount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother and daughter tickets were, in the
words of the petitioner, “married to each other” (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One without the other would not have been
entitled to the discount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if she
left her daughter behind, it would have made no difference in the fare because
the ticket was not refundable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Using the discounted tickets was beneficial to the Government for
they cost 50% less than an economy round trip ticket that the petitioner was
entitled to purchase for the same trip if she <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She obviously saved money (SFr.1,399)
for the government by using her discounted tickets even if her daughter’s fare
was included therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since petitioner was moved by the best of motives in using the
discounted tickets which she had purchased before she received the order to
attend the UNCTAD conference in Havana, her action should be commended instead
of condemned (Hernandez vs. Chairman, Commission on Audit, 179 SCRA 39).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner’s problems probably would not have arisen if before
embarking on the <st1:city><st1:place>Havana</st1:place></st1:city> trip she
had asked DFA for permission to use the two (2) discounted round-trip tickets
for the <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>-<st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state>-<st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>
portion of her trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her inadvertence
was construed by the Government as lack <span style="">of
</span>candor and honesty on her part.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court believes however that she did not intend to falsify or conceal
the truth when she filed a claim for the refund of the total cost <span style="">of </span>her discounted tickets
(SFr.1,597).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her claim for the whole
discounted fare was based on the fact that her daughter’s ticket was
inseparable from her own fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had
to go together to be entitled to the special discount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their fare was indivisible, hence, the
Government’s offer to shoulder only the petitioner’s portion of the discounted
fare (SFr.950), excluding her daughter’s portion (SFr.647) was neither fair nor
reasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the <span class="SpellE">DFA’s</span> objection to the
refund of the entire discounted fare to her, the petitioner returned the whole
amount of SFr.1,597 which she had earlier received from the DFA, and asked, in
return, for the cost of the regular economy fare (SFr.2,966) which she was
legally entitled to purchase for her trip.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the Secretary reprimanded her for misconduct and recalled her
to the home office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the
Office of the President, the latter ironically found her guilty of the more
serious offense of dishonesty, reprimanded her <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
and recalled her to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that under the circumstances above
narrated, the petitioner’s actuation constituted neither dishonesty nor
misconduct, hence, the reprimand that was meted to her was unmerited.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the Court is not disposed to disturb the order of
the DFA and the Office of the President recalling the petitioner to the home
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>no merit in the petitioner’s contention that her tour of duty
in Geneva was for four (4) years, as provided in Section 260 of P.D. No. 1578
(“Instituting the Administrative Code of 1978”), thus:</p>

<blockquote>“(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tour of duty - (1) The tour of duty of a
foreign service officer at any post shall be four (4) years commencing on the
date of his arrival at the post, after which he shall be transferred to another
post.” (p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out by the Solicitor General, <span style="">P.D. </span>1578 was one of those unpublished “secret” decrees which
this Court in <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span>,
et al., 146 SCRA 446, declared to be inoperative or without legal force and
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">P.D. </span>1578 was expressly repealed on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1987</st1:date>, by Executive Order No. 168, entitled
“REPEALING PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 1578 ENTITLED ‘INSTITUTING THE <span style="">ADMINISTRATIVE </span>CODE OF 1978.’”<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The applicable law therefore is Section 6, Part B, Title III, of
R.A. 708 “The Foreign Service Act of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,”
enacted on <st1:date year="1952" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1952</st1:date>,
providing that:</p>

<blockquote>“Section 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assignments and
Transfers - A Foreign Service <span style="">Officer
may be assigned by the Secretary to serve in the Department or in a diplomatic
or consular post abroad:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided,
however, that <u>the</u> <u>minimum</u> <u>period</u> <u>during which</u> <u>he</u>
<u>may</u> <u>serve</u> <u>in</u> <u>any</u> <u>foreign</u> <u>post</u> <u>shall</u>
<u>be</u> <u>one</u> <u>year</u> and the maximum period four years, except </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, in which event he may
be transferred </span>from one foreign post to another or to the Department by
the order of the Secretary without regard to his length of service in his
former post.” (Underscoring supplied; p. 202, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the petitioner had been appointed to her post on <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1986</st1:date>, she had already served
the minimum one-year period of service when her recall on <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1988</st1:date> came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her reassignment to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
did not have to be explained and justified by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs
nor the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner’s designation as the permanent representative of
the Philippine Government to the United Nations and other International
Organizations in Geneva (Annex B, p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), was
one based on the special trust and confidence which the appointing power, the
President, had in the appointee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once
that trust and confidence ceased to exist, the incumbent’s continuance in the
position became untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tenure of officials holding primarily confidential positions
ends upon loss of confidence, because their term of office lasts only as long
as confidence in them endures (Corpus vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>,
13 SCRA 591).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When that confidence is
lost and the officer holding the position is separated from the service, such
cessation is not removal from office but merely an expiration of his/her term (<span class="SpellE">Cadiente</span> vs. Santos, 142 SCRA 280).</p>

<p class="BODY">An incumbent of a primarily confidential position holds office at
the pleasure of the appointing power.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">“Primarily confidential” denotes “not only confidence in the
aptitude of the appointee for the duties of the office but primarily close
intimacy which insures freedom of intercourse without embarrassment or freedom
from misgivings of betrayals of personal trust or confidential matters of
state” (<span class="SpellE">Pinero</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>,

<p class="BODY">It is the fact of loss of confidence, not the reason for it, that
is important and controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As holder <span style="">of a </span>primarily confidential position,
petitioner’s foreign assignment was <span style="">at </span>the
pleasure of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recall
order terminating her tour of duty in <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>

location of work.</p>

justifiably assail the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span> as her replacement in <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>
because the power to appoint is essentially discretionary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointing power, the President, has the
right of choice which she may exercise freely, according to her best lights (<span class="SpellE">Pamantasan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Lungsod</span>

not order the reinstatement of the petitioner to her former position in <st1:city><st1:place>Geneva</st1:place></st1:city>
for that would be tantamount to a usurpation by this Court of the power of
appointment, which is the exclusive prerogative of the Chief Executive (Article
VII, Section 16, 1987 Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would <span style="">violate the system of separation

(Assignment Order No. 58/88) was a valid exercise of his authority as an alter

“performed and promulgated in the regular course of business, are, unless
