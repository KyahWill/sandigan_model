<p class="BODY">On the basis of the verified complaint of 13-year old Rosie Pascual,
with the assistance of her father Jose Pascual, Alvarez was charged with rape
thus -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x on or about September 22, 1983, in barangay Carayungan

<p class="BODY">Thirteen-year old Rosie Pascual, then an elementary pupil at the
Cabangaran Elementary School, Umingan, Pangasinan, was in school on 22
September 1983.  At around 12:00 o'clock
noon, she was invited by her classmate Merlita Valdez to lunch at the house of her
stepfather, appellant Reynaldo Alvarez.  They were accompanied by another classmate, Sorita Macabiog.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
After lunch, Merlita and Sorita went out of the house and sought shelter under
an "aratiles" tree, while Rosie was invited by Alvarez to his room
upstairs.  As she entered his room,
Alvarez suddenly undressed her and laid her down without saying a word.  He removed her panty, then his own pants,
placed himself on top of her, spread her legs, and forced his penis in.  She could not shout because Alvarez placed a
handkerchief in her mouth.  He was
threatening to take her life.  She felt
intense pain when he inserted his penis that he was not able to insert it all
the way.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The sexual assault lasted for one hour after which appellant
removed the handkerchief from her mouth while persisting in his threat on her
life.  She did not immediately report
the outrage to her parents because she was afraid appellant would harm
her.  Eventually, however, she had to
spill the beans because she and Merlita quarreled, and the latter spoke loudly
of Rosie's sexual experience with Alvarez, which was overheard by their
teacher, Mr. Abelardo Magpili, who then wrote Rosie's father to see him.  When her father arrived, Mr. Magpili asked Rosie,
if indeed appellant Alvarez sexually abused her, and she answered in the
affirmative.  Then her father confronted
her himself and she gave the same answer.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Rosie and her father then went to report the matter to the
Barangay Captain who advised them to file a complaint with the police authorities
and have Rosie medically examined at the puericulture center.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><b>
</b>She was examined at the center by Dr. Thelma C. Busto, Rural Health
Officer, who also examined the other rape victims of Alvarez.  Afterwards, Rosie gave a signed written
statement to the police in the form of an affidavit-complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Rural Health Officer confirmed that Rosie had a laceration on
her hymen possibly caused by sexual abuse, probably due to the pressure and
size of a male organ, her vaginal canal admitting one finger, a sign that she
was already deflowered.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Quite interestingly, Alvarez claims that he came to know of
complainant only when he was already in jail.  He asserts that on 22 September 1983 he was at Barangay Dadap, Solano,
Nueva Vizcaya, in the house of his sister, Delia Alvarez Bartolome, to collect
from her P2,000.00 she owed him.  He
arrived there on the 19th and stayed with her until he was paid on the 24th;<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
alibi, in other words.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contradicting his own narration that he came to know Rosie only
when he was already in jail, Alvarez avers that Rosie and Merlita, together
with their classmates, used to frequent his house although Rosie had lunch
there only once.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As if to offer an explanation why he was charged, appellant now
informs Us that Rosie's parents only wanted to extort money from him as he has
been known to be a money lender since his return from Libya where he worked for
90 dinars a month.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
He also claims that the Barangay Captain had an axe to grind against him
because at one time he was not able to lend him money.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He admits having several rape cases pending against him where the complainants
were all Grade V pupils of Cabangaran Elementary School and was in fact
convicted in one,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
which will be correlated herein later in this decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further alleges that on 23 September 1983 he had his bicycle
repaired and even advised Merlita not to lend it to anybody.  Perhaps realizing he was off to a gaffe as
on that date he was supposed to be in Barangay Dadap, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya,
according to his earlier statement, he explains that his seeming conflicting
dates were due to his worries over the rape cases filed against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also presented Santiago Bartolome, brother-in-law of
appellant, in an obvious effort to corroborate his alibi that he was in
Barangay Dadap, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, on 22 September 1983 when the crime was
committed.  However, the trial court
discarded the defense and sustained the prosecution instead.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused assails the trial court (a) for
finding him guilty on the basis of the complainant's testimony which, according
to him, is incredible and contrary to human experience; (2) for not considering
her behavior after the alleged incident; (3) for not finding that there is no
basis for his conviction; and, (4) for considering the other rape cases filed
against him, in violation of the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule under Sec.
48, Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crux of appellant's defense is that the testimony of
complaining witness is so incredible and contrary to human experience that it
cannot in the least justify a conviction.  He insists that the complaining witness willingly went up his room while
her classmates went out to play; that the finding that Rosie was cowed and
coerced into going upstairs and submitting to him is contrary to the evidence,
and that she even received the P5.00 he gave her right after their sexual
encounter; and, that the trial court erred in failing to consider the length of
time it took the accused to consummate the act.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the evidence on record, and We are
convinced more than ever that the judgment convicting the accused for rape must
be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rape cases, the accused may be convicted solely on the
testimony of the complaining witness provided such testimony is credible,
natural, convincing and otherwise consistent with human nature and the course
of things.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The prosecution need not present testimonies of people other than the offended
party herself if her testimony is accurate and credible.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
After all, according to Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa, "[R]ape is
essentially an offense of secrecy, not generally attempted except in dark, or
deserted and secluded places, away from prying eyes.‚Äù<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As it has oft been repeated, on the matter of the credibility of
witnesses the findings of the trial court are generally accorded great weight
and respect, if not conclusive effect, because it has the opportunity to
observe the demeanor of witnesses while testifying.  Such findings may only be disturbed on appeal if there is any
showing that the trial court overlooked some material or substantial facts
which if given consideration will alter the assailed decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar is no exception.  There is no indication whatsoever that the findings of the trial court
have been arrived at arbitrarily.  On
this point, We need only quote the observations of the trial court on the
credibility and demeanor of offended party Rosie Pascual -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x the Court has observed the conduct and demeanor of the
complaining witness while testifying and has reached the conclusion that there
is no reason to doubt her version of the incident."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We cannot doubt, indeed, the testimony of Rosie.  In this jurisdiction, it is unthinkable that
a rural teener, an elementary pupil, would endure the embarrassment and
humiliation of a public disclosure that she had been ravished, allow an
examination of her private parts, and undergo the ordeal and expense of a court
proceeding if her story is a lie.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
A victim of rape will not come out in the open if her motive is not to obtain
justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court thus notes with approval the observations of the Solicitor General
thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Concededly, the complainant when called by the appellant to
go upstairs did so and upon his request, without asking her friends to
accompany her.  It must be noted however
that according to the appellant himself, it was not the first time that he saw
the complainant in his house.  The
complainant had been one of the regular classmates/schoolmates of his
stepdaughter frequenting their house.  Thus, for reason of familiarity with appellant and for obvious lack of
malice on the part of the unsuspecting 13-year old minor, she went with him
into his room.  The minor, at the time,
had no idea of appellant's ill motives and lewd designs on her.  Hence, her innocence could not be taken
against her, contrary to appellant's suggestion that the victim consented to
the sexual assault.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x x<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rosie testified that she could no longer resist appellant's<b>
</b>assault on her because she was so afraid that she could not do anything
anyway.  As a matter of fact, she could
not even push him away (pp. 14, 16, 17; Tsn, January, 5, 1984).  As correctly found by the trial court, the
13-year old Rosie had sufficient basis to believe that no amount of resistance
could prevent appellant from pursuing his lascivious intentions, since the mere
sight of the accused alone could have instilled fear on her (p. 14,
Decision).  The strength of a dark and
burly man in his forties was more than enough to cow and overcome the
resistance of a young thirteen-year old <i>(People v. Basiga</i>, 169 SCRA
76)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under this lucid narration of facts, it can hardly be said that
the judgment of conviction is baseless.  The credible, detailed and straightforward testimony of Rosie, as
observed by the trial court, becomes more pronounced when We consider the
conflicting testimonies of Alvarez.  In
one breath he would say that he saw Rosie for the first time only when he was
already in jail, in another breath he would claim that she and his stepdaughter
Merlita, together with their classmates, would frequent his house.  While he says that from the 19th to the 24th
of September 1983 he was in Barrio Dadap, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, collecting a
debt of his sister, he also testified that on the 23rd of September he had his
bicycle repaired in his house in Carayungan Sur, Umingan, Pangasinan, and even
advised Merlita after its repair not to lend it to anybody.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alvarez insists that he never cowed, much less coerced, Rosie
into submission; that he did not threaten her verbally or physically to make
her submit to his sexual desires.  But
the evidence against him is overwhelming.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that force or violence required in rape cases
is relative; when applied, it need not be overpowering or irresistible.  What is essential is that the force used is
sufficient to consummate the purpose which the offender had in mind, or to
bring about the result.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The force or violence necessary in rape is naturally a relative term, depending
on the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
In this light, the trial court is correct in holding that -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x x Under this situation, taking into account the
circumstances of the place (isolated room), time (just after lunch) and the person
(no one was with the victim, for Merlita Valdez and Sorita Macabiog were then
under the aratiles tree outside the house), we do not know what kind of
resistance was expected to be offered by a young, innocent 13-year old girl
against the accused, of whom she must have been so much afraid when he told her
not to tell her parents about what he had done to her.  Certainly, the immature, irresponsible
barrio girl under these circumstances had to meekly submit herself."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Alvarez further argues that the behavior of Rosie before and
after the alleged rape only exhibits the weakness, if not futility, of the
charge.  To Us, it is rather his theory
that is weak and futile.  As appropriately
pointed out by the Solicitor General -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x x People react differently under emotional stress.  There is no standard form of behavior when
one is confronted by a shocking incident especially if the assailant is
physically near; the workings of the human mind when placed under emotional
stress are unpredictable; and that people react differently.  In a given situation, some may shout, some
may faint, some may be shocked into insensibility, while others may yet welcome
the intrusion."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That Rosie did not immediately divulge her ravishment does not
necessarily mean that she was not sexually desecrated.  Being then in a very tender age and utterly
innocent of the ways of the world, her temporary silence could be
understandable.  She could have been terrified
by the threats of appellant and shocked into insensibility by the bestiality
she was subjected to.  To a very young
and naive barrio girl, she could suffer in silence, albeit momentarily, if only
to avoid humiliation and embarrassment that may be brought about by the public
disclosure of such dastardly act.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier mentioned, the accused admits that there are several
rape cases pending against him where the complainants were then all Grave V
pupils of Cabangaran Elementary School where his stepdaughter was also
studying, and that he was in fact convicted in one.  Taking cue from this admission, We delved into the other rape
case where he says he was convicted and found that on 23 September 1983, or one
day after the rape of Rosie in the case at bar, he also raped Mary Grace F.
Lacasandili, a minor of 11 years, or two years younger than Rosie, in his house
where he also raped Rosie, and for which he was sentenced to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> and to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P30,000.00
for moral damages.  This case of Mary
Grace is reported in G.R. No. 70831, 29 July 1988, 163 SCRA 745, as
"People v. Reynaldo Alvarez y Soriano", penned by Mr. Justice Leo D.
Medialdea, also of the First Division of this Court.  We quote pertinent portions of the findings of fact in that
decision which show the same pattern adopted by the accused in the commission
of rape -</p>

<blockquote>"The complainant, Mary Grace Lacasandili, was under 12 years
of age on September 23, 1983.  She had a
classmate, Merlita Valdez, who is the step daughter of accused-appellant,
Reynaldo Alvarez.  Merlita resided with her
mother and stepfather in one house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about noontime of the aforesaid date, Merlita invited the
complainant to watch television at her residence.  The television set was inside a room located on the second floor
of the house.  After the television program
was over, Merlita went out of the house leaving behind the complainant alone in
the room.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Shortly afterwards, appellant approached and held the
complainant, and then made her lie down on the floor.  When the complainant asked the appellant why she was being made
to lie down, the latter answered that he will have sexual intercourse with
her.  The complainant protested but the
appellant insisted and later removed the panties of the former.  The complainant shouted for help but was
told by the appellant to stop.  The
appellant later placed himself on top of the complainant, unzipped his pants
and tried twice to insert his penis inside the vagina of the latter.  The appellant stood and left after he failed
to make such insertion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the incident, the complainant put on her panties and
left the house.  She later saw Merlita
under a tree located near the same house.  When the complainant asked Merlita why she did not render any assistance
despite her shout for help, the latter replied, ‚ÄòI should not have invited you
to have sexual intercourse with my stepfather.‚Äô The complainant did not report
to anyone what the appellant did because he earlier threatened to kill her if
she did so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The records also show that on October 18, 1983, Mary Grace,
Merlita, and three of their classmates quarreled among themselves in school
regarding their having been the victims of rape.  Upon learning of the cause of the quarrel, their teachers
conducted an investigation.  The girls,
including the complainant, recounted the ordeal they suffered in the hands of
the accused-appellant.  Later, the
school authorities wrote to the parents of the victims informing them of the
sexual abuses done to their daughters.  The parents of the victims in turn reported the matter to the barangay captain
and the latter sent out barangay tanods to look for the appellant x x x x"<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the contention that the trial court was affected by
the other rape cases against the accused in convicting him, in violation of the
<i>"res inter alios acta"</i> rule, it is clear from the decision in
the case at bar that the judgment of the court <i>a quo</i> was based mainly on
the strength of the evidence of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the appalling sexual aberration which, it is not too
remote, may leave a permanent scar on Rosie's psyche, the award of P10,000.00
for moral damages is too meager, to say the least; hence, the amount should be
raised to P30,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is <i>AFFIRMED,</i>
with the modification that the award of moral damages to ROSIE PASCUAL is
increased to P30,000.00.  Costs against
accused-appellant.</p>
