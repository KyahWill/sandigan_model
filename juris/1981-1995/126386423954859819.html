				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:27.0pt">Justice Ramon B. <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span>
wrote a letter to this Court on January 20, 1989, requesting that he be granted
retirement benefits under Republic Act No. 910, as amended, in addition to, or
in lieu of, the benefits he received under Republic Act 1616 upon the
termination, on July 31, 1986, of his service in the Judiciary by the
acceptance of his courtesy resignation by Her Excellency, President Corazon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> tendered his courtesy resignation pursuant to
Proclamation No. 1 dated <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="2">February 25,
 1986</st1:date>, requiring "all appointive public officials to submit
their courtesy resignations beginning with the members of the Supreme
Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Ramon B. <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> served the
Government in different capacities for 36.23 years, of which 10 years, 2
months, and 27 days were served in the Judiciary as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">He was Justice of the Peace for 11 months and 5 days, a CFI Judge
for 8 years and 2 days, and a CA Justice for 1 year, 3 months and 20 days, or a
total service of 10 years, 2 months and 27 days on the Bench.</p>

<p class="BODY">Born on <st1:date year="1926" day="12" month="11">November 12,
 1926</st1:date> (Annex F), Justice <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> was 59
years, 8 months and 19 days old when he was "forcibly" retired on <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1986</st1:date> or 3 months and 11 days
short of 60 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) approved his
retirement under Republic Act No. 1616 which enabled him to receive a
retirement pay equivalent to his highest monthly salary as an Appellate Court
Justice multiplied by 24 months as provided in Section 1, par. (c) <span class="GramE">of</span> said Republic Act No. 1616 which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Retirement is
likewise allowed to a member, <u>regardless of age</u>, who has rendered at
least <u>twenty years of service</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The benefit shall, in addition to the return of the personal
contributions plus interest, be only a gratuity equivalent to one month salary
for every year of service, based on the highest rate received, <u>not to exceed
twenty-four months</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This gratuity is
payable by the employer or office concerned which is hereby authorized to
provide the necessary appropriation or pay the same from savings in its
appropriations."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If, as he now requests, he would be allowed to retire under Republic
Act No. 910, he will receive a lump sum of five (5) years gratuity - or 60
months - computed on the basis of his highest monthly salary and allowances as
a CA Justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having already received a
24-month lump sum gratuity under Republic Act No. 1616, he can expect a
retirement pay differential of 36 months plus a lifetime monthly annuity after
five (5) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no gainsaying
the fact that the amount involved is substantial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 910, as amended by Republic Acts Nos. 1057,
1797, 2614, 4627 and 5095 and by Presidential Decree No. 1438, provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"Sec. 1.</i></span><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When a justice of the Supreme Court or of the

municipal judge who has rendered <u>at least twenty years service in the
judiciary or in any other branch of the Government, or in both</u>, (a) <u>retires
for having attained the age of seventy years</u>, or (b) <u>resigns by reason
of his incapacity to discharge the duties of his office</u>, he shall receive
during the residue of his natural life, in the manner hereinafter provided, the
salary which he was receiving at the time of his retirement or
resignation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And when a justice of the
Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, a judge of Court of First Instance,
Industrial Relations, Agrarian Relations, Tax Appeals, Juvenile and Domestic
Relations, or a city or municipal judge <u>has attained the age of sixty years
and has rendered at least twenty years service in the government, the last five
of which shall have been continuously rendered in the judiciary</u>, he shall
likewise be entitled to retire and receive during the residue of his natural
life, also in the manner hereinafter provided, the salary which be was then
receiving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"Section 2.</i></span><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case a justice of the Supreme Court or of
the Court of Appeals or a judge of the Court of First Instance, Circuit
Criminal Court, Agrarian Relations, Tax Appeals, Juvenile and Domestic
Relations, city or municipal court, or any other court hereafter established, <u>dies
while in actual service</u>, his heirs shall receive a lump sum of five years
gratuity computed on the basis of the highest monthly salary plus the highest
monthly aggregate of transportation, living and representation allowances
received by him as such justice or judge, <u>if by reason of his length of
service in the government he was already entitled to the benefits of this Act</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same benefits provided in this section
shall be extended to any incumbent justice of the Supreme Court or the Court of
Appeals, or a judge of the Court of First Instance, Circuit Criminal Court,
Agrarian Relations, or city or municipal court, or any other court hereafter
established, as the case may be, who <u>without having attained the length of
service required in Section one hereof, shall have to retire upon reaching the
age of sixty-five years, or upon other causes, such as illness or permanent
physical disability</u>, to be certified to by the tribunal to which the
justice concerned belongs, or by the Supreme Court in the case of an incumbent
judge of the Court of First Instance, and other similar courts of record, or a
city or municipal judge, <u>which render him incapacitated to continue in his
position</u>.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"Section 3.</i></span><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon retirement, a justice of the Supreme
Court or of the Court of Appeals, or a judge of the Court of First Instance,
Circuit Criminal Court, Agrarian Relations, Tax Appeals, Juvenile and Domestic
Relations, city or municipal court, or any other court hereafter established
shall be automatically entitled to a <u>lump sum of five years' gratuity</u>
computed on the basis of the highest monthly salary plus the highest monthly
aggregate of transportation, living and representation allowances he was
receiving on the date of his retirement; and thereafter upon survival <u>after
the expiration of this period of five years</u>, to a further <u>annuity
payable monthly during the residue of his natural life</u> equivalent to the
amount of the monthly salary he was receiving on the date of his
retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, that if
the reason for the retirement be any permanent disability contracted during his
incumbency in office and prior to the date of retirement he shall receive only
a gratuity equivalent to ten years' salary and allowances aforementioned with
no further annuity payable monthly during the rest of the retiree's natural
life." (Underscoring supplied.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As provided in Section 1, the justices or judges who may enjoy
retirement benefits with lifetime annuity, should, as a condition <u>sine qua
non</u>, have rendered "at least 20 years service in the judiciary or in
any other branch of the Government, or both." They fall into three (3)
categories:</p>

<blockquote><i>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those who <span class="SpellE">mandatorily</span> retire at age 70 and had rendered at least 20
years service in the judiciary or any other branch of the Government or both;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those who resign by
reason of incapacity to discharge the duties of their office and had rendered
at least 20 years service in the judiciary or in any other branch of the
Government or both; and<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those who voluntarily
retire at age 60 after having rendered at least 20 years service in the
Government, the last 5 years of which were continuously rendered in the
judiciary.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 enumerates the instances when a justice or judge is
entitled to receive the lump sum of 5 years gratuity, without the lifetime
annuity, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he dies while in
actual service after having rendered at least 20 years service in the
Government;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he retires at age
65 without having rendered 20 years service in the Government; and<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When be retires
"upon other causes such as illness or permanent physical disability" without
having rendered 20 years service in the Government.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 3 provides that in addition to the lump sum of 5 years
gratuity, the retiree, upon having survived 5 years after his retirement, shall
be entitled "to a full annuity payable monthly during the residue of his
natural life equivalent to the amount of the monthly gratuity he was receiving
on the date of his retirement." However, if a justice or judge retires due
to a <u>permanent disability</u> contracted during his incumbency in office and
prior to the date of retirement, he shall receive a <u>lump sum of 10 years
gratuity</u> with no further annuity payable monthly during the rest of his
natural life.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as Justice <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> rendered
36.23 years of service in the Government, more than ten (10) years of which
were served in the judiciary, he is entitled to retire under Section 1 of
Republic Act No. 910.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He comes under the
second category of justices or judges who, after having rendered at least 20
years service in the judiciary or in any other branch of the Government, or in
both, have to "resign by reason of their incapacity to discharge the
duties of their office." In the case of Justice <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span>,
he was forced to resign when his courtesy resignation was required by President
Corazon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> under her Proclamation No. 1
directing all appointive officials to hand in their courtesy resignations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance of his courtesy resignation by
President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> on <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1986</st1:date> resulted in his "incapacity to
discharge the duties of his office," which otherwise he could have
continued to discharge until he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70
years.</p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court held in Ortiz vs. Commission on Elections, et al.,
G.R. No. 78957, <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1988</st1:date>,
"a courtesy resignation cannot properly be interpreted as resignation in
the legal sense for it is not necessarily a reflection of a public official's
intention to surrender his position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, it manifests his submission to the will of the political
authority and the appointing power."</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is a "courtesy resignation" similar to a
voluntary retirement under the third classification in Section 1 of Republic
Act No. 910 of justices or judges who <u>voluntarily</u> retire at age 60 after
rendering "at least 20 years service in the government, the last 5 years
of which were continuously rendered in the judiciary."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no age requirement for a justice or judge (in the second
group in Section 1 of RA No. 910) who "resigns by reason of incapacity to
discharge the duties of his office, the only requirement being that he should
have rendered "at least 20 years service in the judiciary or in any other
branch of the government, or in both." Neither is it mandated that the last
five (5) years of his service should have been rendered continuously in the
judiciary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That requirement applies only
to justices and judges in the third group - the voluntary retirees who opt for
retirement at age 60.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> fills the bill for the second group (the <span class="SpellE">resignees</span>) in Section 1 of Republic Act No. 910.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had rendered more than 36 years of service
in the Government, of which more than 10 years were served in the
Judiciary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His "incapacity to
further discharge the duties of his office" resulted from his forced
resignation pursuant to Proclamation No. 1 of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His long record of service is unstained by
scandal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Retirement laws should be liberally construed and applied in
favor of the persons intended to be <span class="SpellE">benefitted</span>
thereby, for, as <span class="GramE">We</span> again held in the Ortiz case:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</i></span><i> To a public servant, pension is not a
gratuity but rather a form of <u>deferred compensation for services performed</u>
and his right thereto commences to vest upon his entry into the retirement
system and becomes an <span class="SpellE">enforcible</span> obligation in court
upon fulfillment of all conditions under which it is to be paid. Similarly,
retirement benefits receivable by public employees are valuable parts of the
consideration for entrance into and continuation in public employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They serve a public purpose and a primary
objective in establishing them is to induce able persons to enter and remain in
public employment, and to render faithful and efficient service while so
employed." <span class="GramE">(Ortiz vs. COMELEC, <u>supra</u>, pp. 10-11;
emphasis ours.)</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">,</span>
the application of Justice Ramon B. <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> for
retirement benefits under Republic Act No. 910, as amended, is hereby
approved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government Service
Insurance System is ordered to process his application and the payment of his
retirement benefits under that law, deducting the benefits he had earlier
received under Republic Act No. 1616.</p>
