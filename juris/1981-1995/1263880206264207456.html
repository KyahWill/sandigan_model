<blockquote>"That at around 11:00 o'clock in the evening of February 24,
1989, while she and her husband were sleeping inside their house, they were
awakened by the loud knocks on their door; Her husband opened the door and they
saw that the person who was knocking was their "<span class="SpellE">Pareng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Troping</span>", accused herein; her husband invited
the accused, who appeared to be very drunk, to come inside their house; once
inside their house, accused sat down and the two (accused and victim) exchanged
pleasantries; she even saw the accused showing a gun to her husband and the
latter even toyed with it; she got irritated by her husband's playing with the
gun, so she took a few steps away from the two, however, when she looked back
to the place where her husband and the accused was, she found out that the two
had already left; five minutes later and/or after she had heard two successive
gunshots, she heard accused knocking at their door and at the same time
informing her that he accidentally shoot (sic) her husband, "Mare, mare, <span class="SpellE">nabaril</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span>
Pare, <span class="SpellE">hindi</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">sinasadya</span>" she got scared by the appearance of the
accused who was full of bloodstains so she pushed him away from her; she
immediately went to her sister-in-law Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Bolima</span>
and both of them proceeded to the house of the accused; thereat, they saw the
victim lying with his face up; she took her husband's pulse and when she still
felt some warmth on his body, she sought help that her husband be brought to
the hospital; accused extended his help by helping them in carrying the victim
towards the main road, however, after a few steps, he changed his mind and put
down the victim; accused reasoned out that the victim was already dead; she
pushed the accused and even without the latter's help, they were able to reach
the main road; <span class="SpellE">afterwhich</span>, some of her neighbors
arrived bringing with them lights; thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span>
policemen arrived and so she caused the arrest of the accused; she spent about
P100,000.00 in connection with burial and wake of her husband.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pat. Orlando Valencia of the <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span>
Police Force on the witness stand testified that on February 24, 1989 in line
with his duty as policeman, a shooting incident was reported to him; he
responded to the said report by proceeding to the crime scene, thereat, he saw
the lifeless body of the victim as well as the accused whose clothing was full
of bloodstains; the cadaver of the victim was referred to the Philippine
Constabulary Crime Laboratory (PCCL) while the person of the accused was turned
over to the Homicide Section of the <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City
Police Station; the day after, at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening and upon
instruction of Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Alilam</span>, he together with some <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> policemen accompanied the accused in retrieving
the firearm (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "F") whom the accused
threw at the grassy area particularly at the back of the latter's house; aside
from the firearm they also recovered two (2) spent bullets (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">G-6 and G-7) and three live ammunitions (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">G-12, G-13 and G-14).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>NBI Ballistician Ernie <span class="SpellE">Magtibay</span> testified
that he has been a ballistician of the NBI since 1984; that pertinent to this
case, he happened to examine a caliber .38 Squires Bingham with serial number
180169 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "F"); that as per his findings
the evidence shells (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. G-6 and G-7) were fired
from the gun, subject matter of this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Forensic chemist from the NBI Edwin <span class="SpellE">Purificando</span>
testified that the paraffin test he conducted on the dorsal aspect of the left
and right hands, that is, from the <span class="SpellE">wristbones</span> to the
fingertips, of the deceased, gave negative result on the presence of nitrates (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "I").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the paraffin test he conducted on the dorsal aspects of the
left hand and right hand of the accused yielded negative results on the
presence of nitrates (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "J").</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, the version of the defense as testified to by
the accused is as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That at about 11:30 in the evening of February 24, 1989 accused on
his way home, after coming from his work, passed by the house of his <span class="SpellE">Pareng</span> <span class="SpellE">Nardo</span>, the victim herein;
while passing <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the said house, his <span class="SpellE">Pareng</span> <span class="SpellE">Nardo</span> called him up; when
he was about to enter the door of the house of the victim, the latter, from the
back of the door, poked a gun at him; he grabbed the gun from his <span class="SpellE">Pareng</span> <span class="SpellE">Nardo</span> and at that
instance, Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Bolima</span> emerging from her room, saw
him holding the gun; he returned the gun to his <span class="SpellE">Pareng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nardo</span> and the latter tucked it in his waistline; he
was served with a beer and after he and the victim consumed about two bottles
of beer, they went out to buy some more; after they were able to buy some more
bottles of beer, victim carried the same and left ahead of the accused; accused
was left behind to answer the call of nature; while in the act of urinating, he
heard two successive gunshots; he followed the victim and he saw the latter
already sprawled on the ground; he inquired from his <span class="SpellE">Pareng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nardo</span> as to what had happened to him,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Pareng</span> <span class="SpellE">Nardo</span>, <span class="SpellE">ano</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">nangyari</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">iyo</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the
victim's replied (sic) was "Pare, <span class="SpellE">binaril</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>", he further inquired as to who shot him but the
victim who was gasping for breath could no longer talk; thereafter, he saw a
gun near the body of his <span class="SpellE">Pareng</span> <span class="SpellE">Nardo</span>;
moved by his desire to bring the said gun to the wife of the victim, he picked
the same, but after he got hold of the gun, he suddenly realized that the
policemen might see him holding it, so he threw the very same gun to the grassy
area; he then ran towards the house of the victim and he informed the wife of
the latter that his <span class="SpellE">Pareng</span> <span class="SpellE">Nardo</span>
was shot to death; he returned to the place where he left the body of the
victim but the body of the latter was no longer there; he later found out that
townspeople carried the body of the victim towards the main road; when the
policemen arrived he was ordered to go with them at the <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span>
Police Headquarters; when he was asked by the policemen as to who shoot (sic)
the victim, his answer was, he did not see the actual shooting incident; never
did he declare nor utter before her <span class="SpellE">Mareng</span> <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> or before any police authorities that he accidentally
shoot (sic) the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he
admitted that it was him who accompanied the policemen in retrieving the fatal
gun at the grassy area at the back of his house."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In holding the accused-appellant guilty as above-stated, the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> relied on circumstantial evidence because the
prosecution failed to present an eyewitness who could give an account as to the
actual shooting incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It considered
the following circumstances which it deemed sufficient to convict the
accused-appellant pursuant to Rule 133, Section 5, of the Revised Rules of
Court:</p>

<blockquote>"The following are among the circumstances which points to the
culpability of the accused.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the widow of the victim saw the accused
holding a gun immediately before shooting incident happened;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That accused was the last person seen in the
company of the victim immediately before the latter was shot to death;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it was the accused who purposely went to
the house of the victim on that fatal evening; The testimony of the accused
that he was merely passing in front of the house of the victim when the latter
who was standing at the window of his house called him up is less credible than
the testimony of the widow of the victim, that they were already <span class="SpellE">aslept</span> (sic) inside their house when or the aforesaid time
accused knocked at their door.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it was the accused who guided the
policemen as to the place where the fatal gun was recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here the Court believes that the gun was
purposely hid at the grassy area at the back portion of <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story of the accused that he
picked the gun for the purpose of bringing it to the widow of the victim but
for fear that the policemen might see him holding the gun, he then decided to
throw it to the place where it was recovered, was too flimsy to merit
belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, what is his reason for
bringing it to the widow of the victim when he surely knew fully well that it
will be the policemen who will investigate the <span class="GramE">case.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, he knew for a fact, that the said
gun could lead as to the identity of the assailant of the victim, why then he
threw it at the grassy area when he could easily leave the same to the place
where he picked it up.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the wife that after hearing
two successive gunshots, accused went back to her house and informed <span class="SpellE">ther</span> (sic) that he accidentally shot her husband deserves
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Court sees no reason
for the wife to concoct such story that would point to the accused as the
culprit specially so that had not the accused became (sic) the prime suspect in
this case, he would be the best person to be used as a prosecution witness,
with more reason that from the evidence presented, it appears that the widow of
the victim <span class="SpellE">harbours</span> no ill-feeling towards the
accused otherwise, she would have prevented <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
entry in her house on that fatal evening.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the wife that accused, immediately
after the shooting incident took place admitted to her having accidentally
shoot (sic) the victim is admissible evidence against the accused <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> since this is covered by the rule on <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span> or one of an exception
to the hearsay rule.</p>

<p class="3Q" style="text-indent: 0in;"><u>Part</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span> - Statement made by a person while a
startling occurrence is taking place or immediately prior <span class="SpellE">tor</span>
(sic) subsequent thereto with respect to the circumstance thereof, may be given
in evidence as a part of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Sec. 36, Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court, as amended).</span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">7)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the accused that he does not
own the gun and that it is but (sic) the accused (sic) who owns the same and in
fact the latter even tucked it in his waistline immediately before the shooting
incident happened is improbable, for, how come then that the assailant was able
to drew (sic) the gun from the waistline of the victim and fired (sic) the same
towards the back portion of the victim's body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is it not that the natural reaction of a person was to face the person
who suddenly and without permission drew something from one's waistline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">sic</span>)</p>

<blockquote>While there is no eyewitness who testified to having seen accused
shoot (sic) the victim, yet all the foregoing circumstances meet the criteria
set by Sec. 5, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended, and
therefore points (sic) to the accused as the person who unlawfully owns the
fatal gun as well as the same person who shoot (sic) to death the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">"<span class="SpellE">Circumstancial</span>
(sic) evidence is admissible in the absence of an eyewitness to the commission
of the crime" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Albofera</span>, 152 SCRA 125
(1983)).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court does not give credence to the denial of the accused that
he was not the one who shoot (sic) the victim as he was some distance away from
the victim answering the call of nature when the victim was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the Court gives credence to the
testimony of the widow that it was the accused whom he saw in possession of the
gun, that it was the accused who was the last person seen in the company of the
victim shortly before the latter died and it was the same accused who lead
(sic) the policemen in retrieving the fatal gun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Admittedly, as per findings of the NBI Forensic Chemist, the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> right and left hand yielded negative result to the
test of nitrates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the same
witness testified that even when a person fired a gun, it does not necessarily
follows (sic) that his hand would be positive to the test of nitrates, as there
are still several factors which affects the presence or absence of nitrates in
the hands of a person.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Although the fact of death of the victim (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"E") is undisputed, still the presence of the qualifying circumstance
of treachery and evident premeditation being alleged in the <span class="GramE">Information,</span>
must be proven like the crime itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To properly appreciate evident premeditation it is necessary to
establish with proof, as clear as the evidence of the crime itself (1) the time
when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly
indicating that the culprit had clung to his determination; and (3) a
sufficient lapse of time to reflect upon the consequence of his act (People vs.
Lorenzo, 132 SCRA 17 (1984); People vs. <span class="SpellE">Obengue</span>, 147
SCRA 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although alleged in the
Information, the record of this case is bereft of any indication that evident
premeditation attended the killing of the victim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, the qualifying circumstance of treachery is appreciated in
this case since its presence could be established by the position/location of
the wound of the victim, that is at the back portion of his torso which
necessarily <span class="GramE">imply</span> that he was treacherously shot by
his assailant."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant assigns only one error in this appeal:</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE
ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF ILLEGAL POSSESSION WITH MURDER AS DEFINED
UNDER SECTION 1 OF P.D. 1866.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCES RELIED UPON BY THE TRIAL COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF
CONVICTION ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THE GUILT OF
ACCUSED-APPELLANT."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> prays that
the decision appealed from be reversed and another be entered acquitting him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the assigned error accused-appellant submits that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the conclusion of the trial
court, he was not the one holding the gun immediately before the shooting
incident, for as admitted by the victim's wife, her husband also "toyed or
played with the gun";<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b) The testimony
of the victim's wife that he was the last person seen in the company of the
victim is unreliable because she was left in the house when the victim and
accused-appellant went out to the store which is about 145 to 150 meters away;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(c) That the
accused-appellant pointed the place where the gun allegedly used in the killing
was recovered, should not create the unfavorable inference that he purposely
hid the gun and should not be taken against him, for knowing the reputation of
police authorities, what he did was dictated by the instinct of
self-preservation rather than guilt;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(d) The testimony
of the wife of the victim that after hearing two successive gunshots
accused-appellant went back to her house and informed her that he accidentally
shot her husband, should not have been considered by the trial court as part of
the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>;
and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(e) The "<span class="SpellE">raciocination</span>" of the trial court regarding the
improbability of the testimony of accused-appellant that he does not own the
gun but that it was the deceased who owned it which the latter tucked in his
waistline before the shooting incident is baseless as the records show that the
deceased was walking ahead of the accused-appellant who was left behind to
answer a call of nature; therefore, it is not highly improbable that some other
person whom the deceased might have met in the street could have taken the gun
from the waistline and shot him with it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would not also be highly improbable that a person from whose
waistline a gun was grabbed could not face his assailant especially when he is
carrying something with his both hands, like the deceased who was carrying one
case of Gold Eagle beer when he was shot at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, accused-appellant was found negative for nitrates when a
paraffin test was conducted on him by a forensic chemist of the NBI.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The People, in its Brief filed by the Solicitor General on 18
April 1990, <span class="GramE">disagrees</span> with the accused-appellant,
maintains that the prosecution was able to establish his guilt beyond
reasonable doubt, and prays that subject decision be affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
stresses that accused-appellant himself admitted and confirmed that he and the
victim went out together to buy some more bottles of beer; he was with the
victim after they bought the beer, and they separated only when he had the urge
to urinate seconds before the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The widow did not testify that she saw what happened in the street; what
she testified was that the accused and the victim went out together and five
minutes later she heard two shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was, therefore, nothing improbable about her testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> likewise contends that the
conclusion of the trial court on the hiding of the gun was based on the
evidence on record; the accused himself testified that he threw the gun on a
grassy area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further argues that the
conclusion of the court on the improbability of appellant’s testimony
concerning the ownership of the gun is not baseless; on the contrary, it is the
theory of the appellant that it is probable that another person may have
grabbed the gun from the victim that is highly improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since appellant was behind the victim he could
have seen a third person grabbing the gun.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">No Reply-Brief was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are now called upon to determine whether, on the basis of the
evidence adduced, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed or the
accused-appellant be acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall first focus our attention on the law under which
accused-appellant is indicted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866 imposes the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> in its maximum period to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
"upon any person who shall unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire,
dispose or <u>possess</u> any firearm, part of firearm, ammunition or
machinery, tool or instrument used or intended to be used in the manufacture of
any firearm or ammunition." It goes further by providing that "if
homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, the
penalty of death shall be imposed."</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be loosely said that homicide or murder qualifies the
offense penalized in said Section 1 because it is a circumstance which
increases the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not,
however, follow that the homicide or murder is absorbed in the offense;
otherwise, an anomalous absurdity results whereby a more serious crime defined
and penalized in the Revised Penal Code is absorbed by a statutory offense,
which is just a <span class="SpellE"><i>malum</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">prohibitum</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale for the qualification, as
implied from the exordium the decree, is to effectively deter violations of the
laws on firearms and to stop the "upsurge of crimes vitally affecting
public order and safety due to the proliferation of illegally possessed and
manufactured firearms, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
In fine then, the killing of a person with the use of an unlicensed firearm may
give rise to separate prosecutions for (a) violation of Section 1 of P.D. No.
1866 and (b) violation of either Article 248 (Murder) or Article 249 (Homicide)
of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
cannot plead one as a bar to the other; or, stated otherwise, the rule against
double jeopardy cannot be invoked because the first is punished by a special
law while the second, homicide or murder, is punished by the Revised Penal
Code.</p>

We held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is a cardinal rule that the protection against double
jeopardy may be invoked only for the same offense or identical offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A simple act may offend against two (or more)
entirely distinct and unrelated provisions of law, and if one provision
requires proof of an additional fact or element which the other does not, an
acquittal or conviction or a dismissal of the does information under one does
not bar prosecution under the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Phrased <span class="SpellE">elsewise</span>, where two different laws (or
articles of the same code) defines two crimes, prior jeopardy as to one of them
is no obstacle to a prosecution of the other, although both offenses arise from
the same facts, if each crime involves some important act which is not an
essential element of the other."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Bacolod</u></span>,
<span class="GramE"><u>supra</u>.,</span> from the act of firing a shot from a
sub-machine gun which caused public panic among the people present and physical
injuries to one, <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for physical injuries
through reckless imprudence and for serious public disturbance were filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused pleaded guilty and was convicted in
the first and he sought to dismiss the second on the ground of double
jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"The protection against double jeopardy is only for the same
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A simple act may be an offense
against two different provisions of law and if one provision requires proof of
an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under
one does not bar prosecution under the other."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">Since the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> were for separate offenses - the first against
a person and the second against public peace and order - one cannot be pleaded

<p class="BODY">However, to justify the imposition of the increased penalty under
Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866 because of the resulting crime of homicide or
murder, the prosecution must allege in the information and prove by the quantum
of evidence required for conviction violation of said section and, more
specifically, the use of an unlicensed firearm and the commission of homicide
or murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the information
in this case is sufficient in form and substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleges illegal possession of a firearm
and of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter is covered by
the clause "which firearm was used with treachery and evident premeditation
in shooting one Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolima</span> y <span class="SpellE">Mesia</span>,
which caused his death."</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the findings and conclusion of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
that more than one circumstantial evidence were duly proved and that these
circumstances point, beyond reasonable doubt, to the accused-appellant as the
one who shot and killed the deceased Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolima</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Mesia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to convict an accused, it is necessary
that the following requisites must be satisfied: (a) there must be more than
one circumstance, (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are
proven, and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce
a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Or, as jurisprudentially formulated, a judgment of conviction based on
circumstantial evidence can be upheld only if the circumstances proven constitute
"an unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion which

inconsistent with any other hypothesis except that of guilty.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The first to the sixth circumstances mentioned by the trial court
were duly established and constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one fair
and reasonable conclusion that the accused-appellant, and no other else, shot
and killed the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not,
however, agree with the additional observation of the trial court, in respect
to the sixth circumstance, that the statement made by the accused-appellant to
the wife of the victim immediately after the shooting incident that he
accidentally shot the victim is covered by the rule on <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a misapplication of the rule in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Statements as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>

rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is that a witness

Accordingly, a testimony of a witness as to what he heard other persons say
about the facts in dispute cannot be admitted because it is hearsay
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, however, exceptions
to this rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them is statements
as part of the <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span>
under Section 36 of Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exceptions assume that the testimony

startling occurrence is taking place or immediately prior or subsequent thereto
with respect to the circumstances thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Statements accompanying an equivocal act material to the issue and
giving it a legal significance may also be received as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, however, the questioned testimony of the
wife of the victim is not hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
testified on what the accused-appellant told her, not what any other party, who
cannot be cross-examined, told her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused-appellant's statement was an "oral confession", not a part of
<span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span>, which he can
easily deny if it were not true, which he did in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The words <u>but</u> <u>the</u> <u>accused</u>
should have been <u>the</u> <u>deceased</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Two more basic issues are left for determination, to wit: whether
the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is
liable for illegal possession of firearms and whether the killing was attended
by the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation as
alleged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our painstaking review of the records and the evidence fails to
disclose that the prosecution presented any evidence to prove that the
accused-appellant was not authorized to possess the firearm alleged in the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, contrary to the
finding of the trial court, there was no sufficient evidence to prove the
presence of treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stated, however, that had illegal possession of
firearms been duly proven as alleged, it would not have mattered whether the
killing was simple homicide or murder since Section 1 of P D. No. 1866
expressly provides that:</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If homicide or murder is committed with the use of an

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">which</span> penalty,

<p class="BODY">The issue concerning the failure of the prosecution to prove that
he had no authority to possess the firearm has not been raised in this

raised it in his motion to reconsider the decision of the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In its resolution denying the motion, the trial court admitted, in effect, that
the prosecution did not offer any evidence to prove that the accused-appellant
had no license to possess or carry the firearm in question; it however, threw
the burden on the accused-appellant to prove that he has that authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Where accused relies as a matter of defense on an exception
in a statute which is not in the enacting clause by which the offense is
described and forbidden, he has the burden of proving that he is within the
exception.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Where the subject matter of a negative averment in the
information, or a fact relied upon by defendant as a justification or excuse,
relates to him personally or otherwise lies peculiarly within his knowledge,
the general rule is that the burden of proof of such averment or fact is on
him' (16 C.J. sec. 998, p. 530).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An illustrative
case of this rule may be found in prosecution for exercising a trade or
profession, or doing other acts, without a license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, it would greatly inconvenience
the prosecution to prove that the defendant had no license, whereas the defendant
could easily prove that he did have one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In cases of illegal possession of firearms, the burden of proof as
to the negative averments in the information to the effect that the accused
possesses the firearms without the corresponding license is on the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the accused who is called
upon to prove that he possesses the license.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the fact relied upon by the accused as a justification
or excuse being one that is related to him personally or otherwise within his
peculiar knowledge, 'the general rule is that the burden of proof as to such
averment or fact is on the accused' (Francisco, Handbook on Evidence, pp.
379-380, 1984 Ed., citing cases)."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

are of the considered opinion that under the provisions of Section 2, Rule 131
of the Rules of Court which provide that in criminal cases the burden of proof
as to the offense charged lies on the prosecution and that a negative fact
alleged by the prosecution must be proven if 'it is an essential ingredient of
the offense charged', the burden of proof was with the prosecution in this case
to prove that the firearm used by appellant in committing the offense charged
was not properly licensed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It cannot be denied that the lack or absence of a license is an
essential ingredient of the offense of illegal possession of a firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information filed against appellant in
Criminal Case No. 3558 of the lower court (now G. R. NO. 27681) specifically
alleged that he had no 'license or permit to possess' the .45 caliber pistol
mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it seems clear
that it was the prosecution's duty not merely to allege that negative fact but
to prove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view is supported by
similar adjudicated cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tria</span>, 17 Phil. 303, the accused was charged with having
criminally inscribed himself as a voter knowing that he had none of the
qualifications required to be a voter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was there held that the negative fact of lack of qualification to be
a voter was an essential element of the crime charged and should be proved by
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another case (People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Quebral</span>, 68 Phil. 564) where the accused was
charged with illegal practice of medicine because he had diagnosed, treated and
prescribed for certain diseases suffered by certain patients from whom he
received monetary compensation, without having previously obtained the proper
certificate of registration from the Board of Medical Examiners, as provided in
Section 770 of the Administrative Code, this Court held that if the subject of
the negative averment like, for instance, the act of voting without the
qualifications provided by law is an essential ingredient of the offense
charged, the prosecution has the burden of proving the same, although in view
of the difficulty of proving a negative allegation, the prosecution, under such
circumstance, need only establish a <i>prima facie</i> case from the best
evidence obtainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case before
Us, both appellant and the Solicitor General agree that there was not even a <i>prima
facie</i> case upon which to hold appellant guilty of the illegal possession of
a firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Former Chief Justice Moran
upholds this view as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The mere fact that the adverse party has the control of the better
means of proof of the fact alleged, should not relieve the party making the
averment of the burden of proving it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is so, because a party who alleges a fact must be assumed to have
acquired some knowledge thereof, otherwise he could not have alleged it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Familiar instance of this is the case of a
person prosecuted for doing an act or carrying on a business, such as, the sale
of liquor without a license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could
the prosecution aver the want of a license if it had acquired no knowledge of
that fact?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, although proof
of the existence or non-existence of such license can, with more facility, be
adduced by the defendant, it is, nevertheless, incumbent upon the party
alleging the want of the license to prove the allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, as the subject matter of the
averment is one which lies peculiarly within the control or knowledge of the
accused <i>prima facie</i> evidence thereof on the part of the prosecution
shall suffice to cast the onus upon him.' <span class="GramE">(6 Moran, Comments

where no particulars are known as to the manner in which the aggression was
made or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim began and
developed, it can in no way be established from mere suppositions, drawn from
circumstances prior to the very moment of the aggression, that an accused
perpetrated the killing with treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Manalo</u></span>,

<blockquote>"The fact that the fatal wounds were found at the back of the
deceased does not, by itself, compel a finding of treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a finding must be based on some positive
proof and not merely an inference drawn more or less logically from
hypothetical facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has ruled
that the suddenness of an attack is not, of itself, enough to constitute
treachery when the method of the killing does not positively show that the
assailant thereby knowingly intended to ensure the accomplishment of his
purpose without risk to himself from any defense which the victim might put
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, to sustain a finding
of treachery, the means, method or form of attack must be shown to have been
deliberately adopted by the appellant." (citing People vs. <span class="SpellE">Carsano</span>, 95 SCRA 146; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabiling</span>,
