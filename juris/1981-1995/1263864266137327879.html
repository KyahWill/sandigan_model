				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this Petition, <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> North
Express Inc. (PANTRANCO) asks the Court to review the decision of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 05494-95 which affirmed the decisions of the then
Court of First Instance of Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> in
Civil Case No. 561-R and Civil Case No. 589-R wherein PANTRANCO was ordered to
pay damages and attorney's fees to herein private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 7:00 o'clock in the morning of June 12, 1981, the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Ceasar</span> and Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>
and their children Harold Jim, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maricar</span>, together with spouses David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span>
and Fe O. <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> with their son Erwin <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and seven other persons, were aboard a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> on their way to a picnic at <span class="SpellE">Malalam</span>
River, <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, to
celebrate the fifth wedding anniversary of <span class="SpellE">Ceasar</span> and
Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The group, numbering fifteen (15) persons, rode in the passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven by David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span>, who
was also the registered owner thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
they proceeded to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Capayacan</span> to deliver some
viands to one Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span> and thenceforth to San
Felipe, taking the highway going to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malalam</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the highway, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> turned right and proceeded to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malalam</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
at a speed of about 20 <span class="SpellE">kph</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While they were proceeding towards <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malalam</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a speeding PANTRANCO bus from <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>, on its regular
route to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, encroached on the <span class="SpellE">jeepney's</span> lane while negotiating a curve, and collided wit
it.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the accident David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span>,
spouses <span class="SpellE">Ceasar</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> and
Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> and their children, Harold Jim and <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>, died while the
rest of the passengers suffered injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was extensively damaged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the accident the driver of the
PANTRANCO Bus, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez, boarded a car and
proceeded to <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From that
time on up to the present, Ramirez has never been seen and has apparently
remained in hiding.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the victims and/or their surviving heirs except herein
private respondents settled the case amicably under the "No Fault"
insurance coverage of PANTRANCO.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Maricar</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>
through her guardian Francisca O. <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span> and Fe O. <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> for herself and for her minor children, filed separate
actions for damages arising from quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> against
PANTRANCO, respectively docketed as Civil Case No. 561-R and 589-R of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, PANTRANCO, aside from pointing to the late David <span class="SpellE">Ico's</span> alleged negligence as the proximate cause of the
accident, invoked the defense of due diligence in the selection and supervision
of its driver, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 3, 1984, the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
rendered a decision against PANTRANCO awarding the total amount of Two Million
Three Hundred Four Thousand Six Hundred Forty-Seven Pesos (P2,304,647.00) as
damages, plus 10% thereof as attorney's fees and costs to <span class="SpellE">Maricar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> in Civil Case No. 561-R, and the total amount
of Six Hundred Fifty Two Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-Two Pesos (P652,672.00)
as damages, plus 10% thereof as attorney’s fees and costs to Fe <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and her children in Civil Case No. 589-R.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the cases were consolidated and
the Court of Appeals modified the decision of the trial court by ordering
PANTRANCO to pay the total amount of One Million One Hundred Eighty-Nine
Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty-Seven Pesos (P1,189,927.00) as damages, plus
Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) as attorney's fees to <span class="SpellE">Maricar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>, and the total amount of Three Hundred
Forty-Four Thousand Pesos (P344,000.00) plus Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) as
attorney's fees to Fe <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and her children, and to
pay the costs in both cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the assailed decision reads as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">PANTRANCO filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court of
Appeal's decision, but on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="6">June 26,
 1987</st1:date>, it denied the same for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PANTRANCO then filed the instant petition for
review.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner faults the Court of Appeals for not applying the
doctrine of the "last clear chance" against the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner claims that under the
circumstances of <span style="color:windowtext">the case,</span> it was the
driver of the passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> who had the last
clear chance to avoid the collision and was therefore negligent in failing to
utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to
avoid the harm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of the last clear chance was defined by this Court
in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ong</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Metropolitan</u>
<u>Water</u> <u>District,</u> 104 Phil. 397 (1958), in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>The doctrine of the last clear chance simply means that the
negligence of a claimant does not preclude a recovery for the negligence of
defendant where it appears that the latter, by exercising reasonable care and
prudence, might have avoided injurious consequences to claimant notwithstanding
his negligence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine applies only in a situation where the plaintiff was
guilty of prior or antecedent negligence but the defendant, who had the last
fair chance to avoid the impending harm and failed to do so, is made liable for
all the consequences of the accident notwithstanding the prior negligence of
the plaintiff [<span class="SpellE">Picart</span> v. Smith, 37 Phil 809 (1918); <span class="SpellE">Glan</span> People's Lumber and Hardware, et al. v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Alferez</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Calibo</span>, et al., G.R. No. 70493, May 18, 1989.] The
subsequent negligence of the defendant in failing to exercise ordinary care to
avoid injury to plaintiff becomes the immediate or proximate cause of the
accident which intervenes between the accident and the more remote negligence
of the plaintiff, thus making the defendant liable to the plaintiff [<span class="SpellE">Picart</span> v. Smith, <u>supra.</u>]</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, the last clear chance doctrine is invoked for the
purpose of making a defendant liable to a plaintiff who was guilty of prior or
antecedent negligence, although it may also be raised as a defense to defeat
claim for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">To avoid liability for the negligence of its driver, petitioner
claims that the original negligence of its driver was not the proximate cause
of the accident and that the sole proximate cause was the supervening
negligence of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> in failing to avoid the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is petitioner's position that even
assuming <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>arguendo</u></span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span> the bus encroached into the lane of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, the driver of the latter could have swerved the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> towards the spacious dirt shoulder on his right
without danger to himself or his passengers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above contention of petitioner is manifestly devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the petitioner's contention, the doctrine of
"last clear chance" finds no application in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the doctrine to be applicable, it is
necessary to show that the person who allegedly had the last opportunity to
avert the accident was aware of the existence of the peril or should, with
exercise of due care, have been aware of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One cannot be expected to avoid an accident or injury if he does not
know or could not have known the existence of the peril.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, there is nothing to show that
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span>
knew of the impending danger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he
saw at a distance that the approaching bus was encroaching on his lane, he did
not immediately swerve the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to the dirt
shoulder on his right since he must have assumed that the bus driver will
return the bus to its own lane upon seeing the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
approaching from the opposite direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As held by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span><u>.</u>
<span class="GramE"><u>De</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bonifacio</u></span> <u>v.</u>
<u>BLTB,</u> G.R. No.</span> L-26810, August 31, 1970, 34 SCRA 618, a motorist
who is properly proceeding on his own side of the highway is generally entitled
to assume that an approaching vehicle coming towards him on the wrong side,
will return to his proper lane of traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was nothing to indicate to David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span>
that the bus could not return to its own lane or was prevented from returning
to the proper lane by anything beyond the control of its driver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Leo <span class="SpellE">Marantan</span>, an
alternate driver of the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> bus who was seated
beside the driver Ramirez at the time of the accident, testified that Ramirez
had no choice but to swerve the steering wheel to the left and encroach on the <span class="SpellE">jeepney's</span> lane because there was a steep precipice on the
right [CA Decision, p. 2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 45.] However,
this is belied by the evidence on record which clearly shows that there was
enough space to swerve the bus back to its own lane without any danger [CA
Decision, p. 7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 50.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found
that at the time of the accident the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> bus
was speeding towards <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> [CA
Decision, p. 2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 45.] By the time David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> must have realized that the bus was not returning to
its own lane, it was already too late to swerve the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
to his right to prevent an accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
speed at which the approaching bus was running prevented David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> from swerving the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to
the right shoulder of the road in time to avoid the collision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even assuming that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver perceived the danger a few seconds before
the actual collision, he had no opportunity to avoid it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held that the last clear
chance doctrine "can never apply where the party charged is required to
act instantaneously, and if the injury cannot be avoided by the application of
all means at hand after the peril is or should have been discovered" [<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> v. Metropolitan Water District, <u>supra.</u>]</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner likewise insists that David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span>
was negligent in failing to observe Section 43 (c), Article III Chapter IV of
Republic Act No. 4136<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a> which provides that the driver of a
vehicle entering a through highway or a stop intersection shall yield the right
of way to all vehicles approaching in either direction on such through highway.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's misplaced reliance on the aforesaid law is readily
apparent in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cited law
itself provides that it applies only to vehicles entering a through highway or
a stop intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the
accident, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> had already crossed the
intersection and was on its way to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malalam</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner itself cited Fe <span class="SpellE">Ico's</span> testimony that the accident occurred after the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> had <span class="SpellE">travelled</span> a distance
of about two (2) meters from the point of intersection [Petition p. 10; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 27.] In fact, even the witness for the
petitioner, Leo <span class="SpellE">Marantan</span>, testified that both
vehicles were coming from opposite directions [CA Decision, p. 7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 50], clearly indicating that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> had already crossed the intersection.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, the Court finds that the negligence of
petitioner's driver in encroaching into the lane of the incoming <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and in failing to return the bus to its own lane
immediately upon seeing the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> coming from the
opposite direction was the sole and proximate cause of the accident without
which the collision would not have occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was no supervening or intervening negligence on the part of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver which would have made the prior negligence
of petitioner's driver a mere remote cause of the accident.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of its liability as an employer, petitioner claims
that it had observed the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent
damage, conformably to the last paragraph of Article 2180 of the Civil
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner adduced evidence to
show that in hiring its drivers, the latter are required to have professional
driver's license and police clearance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The drivers must also pass written examinations, interviews and
practical driving tests, and are required to undergo a six-month training
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodrigo San Pedro, petitioner's
Training Coordinator, testified on petitioner's policy of conducting regular
and continuing training programs and safety seminars for its drivers,
conductors, inspectors and supervisors at a frequency rate of at least two (2)
seminars a month.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, the Court quotes with approval the following
findings of the trial court which was adopted by the Court of Appeals in its
challenged decision:</p>

<blockquote>When an injury is caused by the negligence of an employee, there
instantly <span class="GramE">arises</span> a presumption that the employer has
been negligent either in the selection of his employees or in the supervision
over their acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although this
presumption is only a disputable presumption which could be overcome by proof
of diligence of a good father of a family, this Court believes that the
evidence submitted by the defendant to show that it exercised the diligence of
a good father of a family in the case of ­Ramirez, as a company driver is far
from sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No support evidence has
been adduced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The professional driver's
license of Ramirez has not been produced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no proof that he is between 25 to 38 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is also no proof as to his educational
attainment, his age, his weight and the fact that he is married or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither are the result of the written test,
psychological and physical test, among other tests, have been submitted in
evidence [sic].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His NBI or police
clearances and clearances from previous employment were not marked in
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was presented that
Ramirez actually and really attended the seminars.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Vital evidence should have been the
certificate of attendance or certificate of participation<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>or evidence of such participation like a
logbook signed by the trainees when they attended the seminars.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">If such records are not
available, the testimony of the classmates that Ramirez was their classmate in
said seminar (should have been presented) [CA Decision, pp. 8-9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 51-52.]</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the fact that <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
Ramirez was employed and remained as its driver only means that he underwent
the same rigid selection process and was subjected to the same strict
supervision imposed by petitioner on all applicants and employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is argued by the petitioner that unless
proven otherwise, it is presumed that petitioner observed its usual recruitment
procedure and company policies on safety and efficiency [Petition, p. 20; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 37.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds the above contention unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of negligence on the part of its driver <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez gave rise to the presumption of negligence
on the part of petitioner and the burden of proving that it exercised due
diligence not only in the selection of its employees but also in adequately
supervising their work rests with the petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Lilius</span>
v. Manila Railroad Company, 59 Phil. 758 (1934), <span class="SpellE">Umali</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-40570, </span><st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 30, 1976</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 69 SCRA 623.]</span> Contrary to petitioner's claim, there is no
presumption that the usual recruitment procedures and safety standards were
observed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere issuance of rules and
regulations and the formulation of various company policies on safety, without
showing that they are being complied with, are not suffi­cient to exempt
petitioner from liability arising from the negligence of its employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is incumbent upon petitioner to show that
in recruiting and employing the erring driver, the recruitment procedures and
company policies on efficiency and safety were followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner failed to do this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court finds no cogent reason to
disturb the finding of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals that the
evidence presented by the petitioner, which consists mainly of the
uncorroborated testimony of its Training Coordinator, is insufficient to
overcome the presumption of negligence against petitioner.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of damages, petitioner claims that the Court of
Appeals <span class="GramE">erred</span> in fixing the damages for the loss of
earning capacity of the deceased victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner assails respondent court's findings because no documentary
evidence in support thereof, such as income tax returns, pay-rolls, pay slips
or invoices obtained in the usual course of business, were presented [Petition,
p. 22; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 39.] Petitioner argues that the
"bare and self?serving testimonies of the wife of the deceased David
<span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and the mother of the deceased Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> ... have no probative value to sustain in law the
Court of Appeals' conclusion on the respective earnings of the deceased
victims." [Petition, pp. 21-22; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
38-39.] It is petitioner's contention that the evidence presented by the
private respondent does not meet the requirements of clear and satisfactory
evidence to prove actual and compensatory damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the Court of Appeals committed no reversible
error in fixing the amount of damages for the loss of earning capacity of the
deceased victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that
private respondents should have presented documentary evidence to support their
claim for damages for loss of earning capacity of the deceased victims, the
absence thereof does not necessarily bar the recovery of the damages in
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Fe <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and Francisca <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span> as to
the earning capacity of David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and the spouses <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>, respectively, are sufficient to establish a basis
from which the court can make a fair and reasonable estimate of the damages for
the loss of earning capacity of the three deceased victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in fixing the damages for loss of
earning capacity of a deceased victim, the court can consider the nature of his
occupation, his educational attainment and the state of his health at the time
of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> was
thirty eight (38) years old at the time of his death in 1981 and was driving
his own passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The spouses <span class="SpellE">Ceasar</span>
and Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> were both thirty (30) years old at
the time of their death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ceasar</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> was a commerce
degree holder and the proprietor of the <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>
Press, printer of the <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span> Valley Newspaper and
the Valley Times at <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>
graduated as a nurse in 1976 and at the time of her death, was the company nurse,
personnel manager, treasurer and cashier of the <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>
Press at <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court duly considered these
factors, together with the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimonies
of Fe <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and Francisca <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span>,
in fixing the amount of damages for the loss of earning capacity of David <span class="SpellE">Ico</span> and the spouses <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, it should be pointed out that the Court of Appeals
committed error in fixing the compensatory damages for the death of Harold Jim <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
court awarded to plaintiff (private respondent) <span class="SpellE">Maricar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>)
as "compensatory damages for the death of Harold Jim <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>." <span class="GramE">[CA Decision, p.14; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, 57.]</span> In
other words, the Court of Appeals awarded only Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as indemnity for the death of Harold Jim <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> and another Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) for
the death of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>de</u>
<u>la</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Fuente</u></span>, G.R. Nos. 63251-52, December
29, 1983, 126 SCRA 518, the indemnity for the death of a person was fixed by
this Court at Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Maricar</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> should therefore be awarded Sixty Thousand Pesos (P60<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as indemnity for the death of her brothers, Harold
Jim <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> or Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) for the death
