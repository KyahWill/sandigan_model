Petitioner seeks a review of the Decision, and Resolution denying 
reconsideration, of the then Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 63087-R 
entitled "The Charter Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Universal Shipping Lines, 
Inc. and E. Razon, Inc.".
<p>
The following are the established facts:  Sometime in April 1973, Union 
Sales Marketing Corporation (UNION) ordered from Union Carbide of 
Antwerp, Belgium, 99,540 kilograms of Low Density Polyethylene, valued 
at US $.245 per kilogram or a total purchase price of US $24,417.30 
(Exhibits "D" &amp; "F"), at the conversion rate of P6.848 to a US 
Dollar (Exhibit "E").
</p><p>
The shipment was packed in 4,000 bags of 25 net kilo­grams, more or 
less, for each bag, and was loaded at Antwerp, Belgium, in good order 
condition on board the "S/S Dingalan Bay", owned and operated by 
Universal Shipping Lines, Inc. (CARRIER) and consigned to UNION in 
Manila.  The shipment was covered by a Marine Risk Note (Exhibit "B") 
issued by Charter Insurance Co. (INSURER) for P212,738.17 against all 
risks.  The CARRIER arrived in Manila on June 22, 1973 and arrastre 
services were handled by E. Razon, Inc. (ARRASTRE), now called Metro 
Port Service, Inc.
</p><p>
It is not disputed that out of the 4,000 bags, 1,050 bags were received 
by the consignee UNION in bad order con­dition (Exhibits "I" to "I-5"; 
Exhibits "22" to "27").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  As
 a consequence of the damage and loss, the INSURER paid UNION the sum of
 P35,709.11 in full settlement of the claim, and the INSURER became the 
subrogee of all of UNION's rights to recover from the parties concerned.
</p><p>
On July 1, 1974, the INSURER sued for damages with the then Court of 
First Instance of Manila against the CARRIER and the ARRASTRE in the 
amount of P35,709.11, in addition to exemplary damages and attorney's 
fees.
</p><p>
Both defendants disclaimed liability, each one attributing the loss to the other.
</p><p>
In its Decision, the Trial Court allocated payment of liabilities as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, defendant Universal Shipping Lines, Inc., is ordered 
to pay plaintiff the amount of P12,285.94 plus 12% interest per annum 
from July 1, 1974 until full payment thereof. </p>
  <p>
    Defendant E. Razon, Inc., is ordered to pay plaintiff the amount of 
P9,763.94 plus 12% interest per annum from July 1, 1974 until full 
payment thereof.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both defendants are ordered to pay the costs.
  </p>
  <p> Both defendants also are jointly and severally liable to pay plaintiff P2,000.00 as attorney's fees."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    On appeal by the CARRIER and ARRASTRE, the then Court of Appeals, on
 March 23, 1981, absolved the CARRIER of any and all liability and held 
the ARRASTRE solely liable.
  </p>
  <p> "IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the judgment appealed from is hereby MODIFIED as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      1.       Defendant E. Razon, Inc., is hereby directed to pay to 
plaintiff, the total sum of P22,049.88, plus interest of 12% interest 
per annum from July 1, 1974 until the sum is fully paid;
    </p>
    <p>
      2.       Dismissing the complaint as against defendant Universal Shipping Lines, Inc.;
    </p>
    <p>
      3.       Defendant E. Razon, Inc., to pay costs under the complaint of plaintiff;
    </p>
    <p>
      4.       Plaintiff to pay costs by reason of its complaint against defendant Universal Shipping Lines, Inc.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant E. Razon to pay costs of this appeal on its appeal against plaintiff-appellant;
</p><p>
Appellee to pay costs of this appeal to appellant Universal Shipping Lines, Inc."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
Reconsideration filed by the ARRASTRE was denied by the Appellate Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
Before us now, the ARRASTRE assails the appealed judgment in that 1) it 
did not give credence and belief to the ARRASTRE's Bad Order 
Certificates (Exhibits "22" to "27"-Razon), and 2) it erred in holding 
the ARRASTRE liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
Ordinarily, in a Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em>, only questions of law may be raised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  And, this Court has held in a number of cases that findings of fact by
 the Court of Appeals are, in general, conclusive on the Supreme Court 
when supported by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  The rule is not absolute, however, and allows of exceptions, which we 
find present in the case at bar in that respondent Court's findings of 
facts are contrary to those of the Trial Court and are contradicted by 
the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
In absolving the CARRIER, respondent Court stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "When the shipment was discharged from the carrying vessel, there 
were 443 bags of shipment which were broken at the ends.  In other 
words, only the end-portions of the 443 bags were torn or broken, 
without any showing that any portion of the contents of these 443 bags 
was spilled or spoiled.  x x x - and no loss or spoilage of the shipment
 having been proved or shown to have occurred when the shipment was 
under the care and custody of the vessel, then the vessel can and should
 not be held liable to answer for the loss of any part of it that was 
found upon the discharge of the shipment from the Arrastre Operator's 
care and custody into the consignee's Broker. </p>
  <p> "x x x The trial court found the value of the losses at 
P22,049.88.  Now, since the losses are shown to have occurred after the 
Arrastre Operator had received the entire shipment of 4,000 bags from 
the vessel, then it can be safely assumed that the losses occurred while
 the shipment was in the care and custody of the Arrastre Operator.  The
 appellant E. Razon, Inc., should, therefore, be liable to pay for the 
whole claim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing completely disregards the evidence of the CARRIER and the 
ARRASTRE that 619 bags were discharged by the CARRIER to the ARRASTRE in
 bad order condition, as evidenced by the original and duplicate copies 
of the Cargo Receipts issued by the CARRIER to the ARRASTRE and signed 
by their respective representatives (Exhibits "1-DDDD to "1-HHHH"; 
Exhibits "2" to "2-D"-Razon).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  The condition of the 619 bags before the turnover to the ARRASTRE from
 the CARRIER was loss or spoilage of up to 50%, as reflected in the 
Survey of Bad Order Cargoes, signed by the CARRIER and ARRASTRE 
representatives (Exhibits "1" to "1-D"-Razon; Exhibits "2" to 
"2-C"-Universal).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  
Accordingly, the Trial Court held the CARRIER liable only for the value 
of a total of 443 bags, as this is the "evidence of the plaintiff" 
(INSURER), at 16.8209 kilograms per bag,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  less than the actual weight of 25 kilograms net per bag (Exhibit  "D";
 Exhibits "1" to "1-C"-Razon) due to some recovery of spillage, or a 
total liability of P12,285.94.
</p><p>
Since 619 bags were discharged from the CARRIER already in bad order 
condition, it follows that the remaining 431 bags were damaged while in 
the ARRASTRE's custody for which it should be held liable.  However, 
since the Trial Court computed the liability of the ARRASTRE at 351 
bags, notwith­standing the ARRASTRE's admission that "80 bags were not 
included in the bad order cargo certificate",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  and the INSURER did not appeal said award by the Trial Court in its desire to have the case terminated soonest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  the lNSURER may not, in this appeal, have the judgment modified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  The liability of the ARRASTRE for P9,763.94 fixed by the Trial Court is thus in order.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment of respondent Court of Appeals is 
hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and that of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila, Branch XI, is hereby reinstated.  No costs.
SO ORDERED.
