was received at the INP Headquarters at Pili, Camarines Sur, of a killing at
Bagong Sirang, Pili, Camarines Sur.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> An

<p class="BODY">At Bagong Sirang the team came upon the lifeless body of Pedro

parts of the body.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The team found at the scene, and took possession of, the rope with which
Nacional had been bound; a bamboo pole and a piece of wood (which appeared to
have been used as weapons); and a telescope.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> The

disclosed that Pedro Nacional, Jr. had died due to "HEMORRHAGE, SEVERE, SECONDARY
TO GUNSHOT WOUND, MULTIPLE FRACTURE, INCISED WOUND," said injuries being
more particularly described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wound, gunshot (entrance right side face,

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fracture, zygomatic bone, right."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Acting on leads apparently obtained through preliminary inquiries
at the scene of the crime, the police officers brought in and investigated
Eduardo Cavite y Taduran (53 years of age) and Augusto San Juan y Cavite (25
years old) on February13, 1986.  Another
suspect, Ernesto Villar y Benavente (18 years old), was questioned, also at the
police station, on February 15, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Eduardo Cavite and Augusto San Juan (and their
families) used to occupy a portion of land owned in common by Pedro Nacional,
Jr. and his brother, Municipal Trial Court Judge Jose Nacional.  Cavite and San Juan however had to vacate
the premises sometime on January 11, 1986 on request of Judge Nacional on
account of suspicions by Pedro Nacional, Jr. that Augusto San Juan had stolen
his goat and had been stoning his house.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The victim's gun, which had been used in killing him, and a
telescope also belonging to him, were recovered by a police team on February
15, 1986.  They were inside a plastic
bag buried some one hundred meters from the house of Jose San Jose;<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
these things were apparently placed there by Benito San Jose after they had
been given to him by his father, Jose San Jose; and the latter had, in turn,
allegedly gotten them from his other son, Pedro San Jose.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Information about these facts had been given to the police officers by Pedro
San Jose;<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and it was Ernesto Villar who led the policemen, at their request, to the house
of Pedro San Jose to look for and retrieve said articles, the gun and the
telescope.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Cavite, San Juan and Villar, gave written statements -- answers
in response to questions of the police investigator -- which were later
presented in evidence at their trial as Exhibits A, B and C, respectively.  The statements were typewritten in English,
and each opened with the following question and answer, <i>viz.</i>:</p>

<blockquote>"APPRAISAL:  Mr. * * *,
<span style="">I </span>would like to inform you that
you are under investigation for your involvement in the commission of an
offense.  Under our New Constitution,
you have the right to remain silent and be entitled to the assistance of a
counsel of your own choice.  Is this
clearly understood by you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>ANSWER:  Yes, sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The statements bore the right thumbmark
of the affiants<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

All three documents were signed by Atty. Jaime Contreras, identified as
"counsel for the accused," and were subscribed and sworn to before
Jesus O. Bolayon, Clerk of Court I of the Municipal Trial Court of Pili, who
incorporated the following certification in each affidavit, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>I FURTHER CERTIFY that, believing (thinking) that this statement
may be used against the affiant, I explained to him his rights under the
Constitution to remain silent and be assisted by counsel of his own choice,
examined his body for signs of violence or torture, and translated to him this
statement in the Bicol dialect which he uses and fully understands, and to all
these the affiant, * * *, affirmed his statement to be true, correct and
voluntary.</blockquote>

Eduardo Cavite stated the following, among other things:</p>

<blockquote>** On or about 9:00 o'clock A.M., February
11, 1980, Pedro San Jose and Ramon San Jose, both residing at Binanuaanan,
Pili, Camarines Sur, went to my house to get his plow which was brought to my
house sometime on December, 1985 for repair.  And, on that same date and time, I asked help from them about my problem
with regards to the non-payment of Atty. Pedro P. Nacional to me and to Augusto
San Juan for the installation of water pump at his ricefield and construction
of his farm house (camarin).</blockquote>

religious celebration commonly known as 'PASYON' which was being done yearly
and told us to go with them to the house of Pedro P. Nacional, Jr.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* *.  While we were on our way to the house of Atty. Pedro P. Nacional, Jr., I

San Jose told me and so with Augusto San Juan to just wait outside and then
said Pedro San Jose pushed the door forcibly of the house of said Pedro
Nacional, Jr. and immediately they all entered the said house.  A little later, I just heard the voice of
Pedro Nacional, Jr. as if being mauled inside the house and a few minutes
later, I saw Pedro Nacional, Jr. whose both hands and feet were hog tied was
being dragged out of the house by Pedro San Jose<span style=""> </span>and Ramon San Jose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* *.  Pedro San Jose and Ramon San Jose and some of their companions who were
armed with boloes and some with a piece of wood hacked and struck Pedro
Nacional, Jr. causing him wound on the different parts of his body.  And after that, I just heard 3 gunshots, but
I did not see to whom it was shot and then they all ran away * *.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* *.  (Before they entered the house) They were all wearing black mask *
*.  I was just standing near the house
and I was surprised because I have no knowledge that their intention was to
kill Pedro Nacional, Jr.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the following declarations are contained in
the affidavit of Augusto San Juan,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> to

<blockquote>* *.  Before the incident happened (on or about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of
February 12, 1986) I went to the store of a certain Ramirez for purposes of buying
cigarrettes, but I was called by Pedro San Jose and told me to enter his house
and while inside, I saw Augusto San Juan, Eduardo Cavite, Nestor Rull, Julian
Tanteo, Luna Echanez and moment later Eduardo Privaldos arrived.  While I was inside Pedro San Jose told me to

followed him, but Luna Echanez, Augusto San Juan and Eduardo Cavite were left
outside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  *
*.  Pedro San Jose pointed Pedro

several times on the head and so with the others causing him wounds.  After that Pedro San Jose and Julian Tanteo

<blockquote>* *.  A moment later, I just heard from Augusto San Juan advising us to look

<p class="BODY">In the course of the investigation, Villar also identified the
"firearm used in killing Pedro Nacional, Jr. and the telescope taken from his
house,"<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
which had been found by the police, buried, at the place to which they had been
guided by Villar.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The three (3) affidavits are substantially identical in their
narration of the assault on Pedro Nacional, Jr. They all state that -</p>

<p class="NUM">1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it was Pedro San Jose
who forcibly shoved open the door of Pedro Nacional's house;</p>

<p class="NUM">2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>once inside, Pedro and
his companions assaulted Pedro Nacional, hitting him with pieces of wood;</p>

<p class="NUM">3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>then they bound Pedro
Nacional hand and foot and dragged him outside the house; and finally,</p>

<p class="NUM">4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pedro Nacional was shot
in the face, and according to two of the affiants (San Juan and Villar), the
shooting was done by Pedro San Jose.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that in their affidavits, all three (3) suspects
attempted to exculpate themselves.   Eduardo Cavite claims that he "was just standing near the
house and ** was surprised because ** (he had) no knowledge that ** (his
companions') intention was to kill Pedro Nacional, Jr." Augusto San Juan asserts
that he and Cavite "were only made to guide *** (the killers and robbers
to) the house of Pedro Nacional, wherein what ** (they) did is only to watch
them while they were in the course of killing the victim **." And Ernesto
Villar alleges that he "was just standing (at) the door of the bedroom
because ** (he) was amazed that ** (his companions') intention was to kill
Pedro Nacional, Jr., and ** (he) was also threatened that if ** (he) will not
go with them something will happen to ** (him), and because they are also **
(his) friends ** (he) went with them."</p>

<p class="BODY">Another circumstance worthy of note is that the three (3)
suspects were all represented by the same attorney during their custodial
investigation, Atty. Jaime Contreras.  At that time, Atty. Contreras was the Election Registrar of Pili,
Camarines Sur.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
According to him, on February 15, 1986, on request of a police officer, Pat.
Torres, he had gone to the Pili police station to extend legal assistance to a
person under investigation, and had there met said person, Ernesto Villar; on
presenting himself to Villar, the latter had asked that he "assist him in
connection with the investigation," and he (Contreras) had agreed
"only for purposes of giving their statement;"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
being "conversant with the Morada and Miranda doctrine wherein lawyers'
services is retained," he had "inquired from ** (Villar) whether he
was being forced or threatened or promised by having any reward so that he
could give his statement" and on receiving the latter's reply that
"he will give voluntarily his statement," had further cautioned him
that "he will not be forced to answer if he do not want to answer,"
after which Villar did proceed to give his statement by question and answer in
the manner set out in his affidavit, Exhibit C, which statement he had
afterwards himself signed.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">According to Contreras, too, he had also been "summoned at
the Police Station to assist ** (other) affiants in their statements,"
these being Eduardo Cavite and Augusto San Juan, and had represented them at
the custodial investigation in more or less the same manner that he had,
Ernesto Villar.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

sworn statements given ** on February 13, 1986 are not true and unvoluntarily

forced to sign his own affidavit but "that such statements were not true
and voluntarily given **." For his part, Augusto San Juan asserts that the
statement given by him to the police was extracted through torture, and he was
retracting the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the conclusion of the preliminary investigation the Municipal
Trial Judge issued a resolution dated April 23, 1986 containing a finding of
probable cause to bind over all the accused for trial for murder, rejecting the
defense of alibi of the accused, and denying bail to all the accused except as
regards Jose San Jose and Benito San Jose, whose participation in the felony
was categorized as that only of accessories.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Provincial Fiscal, however, was of the view that the felony
actually committed was robbery with homicide and accordingly filed an
information dated May 29, 1986 charging all the accused with this crime,
aggravated by treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior
strength.  All the accused were indicted
as principals except for Jose San Jose and Benito San Jose who were accused as
accessories.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial commenced on August 21, 1986 after the accused all entered
a plea of not guilty on arraignment on July 31, 1986.  Only five (5) of the ten indicted were actually tried.  Jose San Jose, Benito San Jose, and Nestor
Rull were never apprehended.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">No eyewitness was presented by the prosecution.  The victim's "common-law wife,"
Edna San Juan, never took the witness stand.  The prosecution suggests that she left Pili, and stayed away from the
trial, because of fear.  In its
memorandum in the proceedings <i>a quo,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a> the
prosecution made the following observations:</p>

<blockquote>" * *.  Edna San Juan,
a native of Bulacan and a complete stranger in Pili * *, was ever conscious of
the fact that one of of the accused, Nestor Rull, was at large.  Her initial determination to stay in Bicol
and testify **, however, soon vanished when she learned that the two other
accused who were detained at the Tinañgis Penal Farm, namely, Pedro San Jose
and Eduardo Privaldos, escaped from the said institution.  Thus, she left for Manila without any
forwarding address."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, in its Decision promulgated on December 29, 1988,<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
the Trial Court found that the guilt of the accused as co-conspirators in the
crime charged had been established beyond reasonable doubt by "the
totality of the contents of Exh. A, B, C,<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>

them to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with the accessories of the
law, and to indemnify the heirs of Pedro P. Nacional, Jr., in the amount of not
less than SIX THOUSAND (P6, 000.00)Pesos."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court opined that the prosecution had substantially
complied with the constitutional requirements governing custodial
investigations <i><span style="">vis </span>a vis</i>
Cavite, San Juan and Villar; that the police officers, the Clerk of Court of
the Pili Municipal Trial Court, and Atty. Jaime Contreras -- who all testified
to the regularity and propriety of the custodial interrogation -- had "no
improper or evil motive to testify falsely against the accused;" and
declared as undeserving of belief the protestations of Cavite and Villar anent
the irregularity in the taking of <span style="">their
sworn statements as well as the "uniform defense of alibi put up by the
accused **."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The five convicted accused seasonably appealed; and in this Court
they impute the following errors to the Trial Court:</p>

<p class="NUM">1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"convicting **
Julian Tanteo and Luna Echanez on the basis of the sworn statements of their
co-accused Cavite, San Juan and Villar marked Exhibits A, B, and C and its
submarkings;"</p>

<p class="NUM">2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"convicting **
Eduardo Cavite, Augusto San Juan and Ernesto Villar based on collateral
evidences of witnesses and sworn statements denied by them;" and</p>

<p class="NUM">3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>not holding that the "prosecution
evidence is weak and not sufficient basis to establish the guilt of accused
beyond reasonable doubt."</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be noted from the facts -- which have been related at some
length to the end that the nature and extent of the evidence may be more precisely
disclosed, analyzed and appreciated -- there is no eyewitness testimony adduced
by the prosecution regarding the acts done by the five accused-appellants
during the occurrence in question.  The
only evidence of the prosecution on the matter consists of the sworn statements
or affidavits given in question-and-answer form to the police by Eduardo
Cavite, Augusto San Juan and Ernesto Villar,<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a> and
what may be considered as the corroborative testimony of the police officers
relative to the subsequent discovery and taking of possession of the pistol and
the telescope allegedly asported from the victim, Pedro Nacional, Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Immediately apparent,
however, is that the three sworn statements are not confessions.  The Rules of Court define a confession as
the "declaration of an accused expressly acknowledging his guilt of the
offense charged.''</span><a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> None of the three (3) affidavits contains
any acknowledgment of ''guilt of the offense charged" on the part of the
affiants.  Not one of them acknowledged
having laid a hand on the victim or assisted in inflicting any injury on him,
or having taken, or assisted in the taking of any property from him.  On the contrary, they all disclaimed any
participation in the offense or even knowledge of any intention or plan to kill
or rob Pedro Nacional, Jr.  In his
affidavit, for example, Eduardo Cavite declared that he "was just standing
near the house and ** was surprised because ** (he had) no knowledge that **
(his companions') intention was to kill Pedro Nacional, Jr." Augusto San
Juan said that he and Cavite "were only made to guide *** (the killers and
robbers to) the house of Pedro Nacional, wherein what ** (they) did is only to
watch them while they were in the course of killing the victim **." And
Ernesto Villar said that he "was just standing at the door of the bedroom
because ** (he) was amazed that ** (his companions') intention was to kill
Pedro Nacional, Jr., and ** (he) was also threatened that if ** (he) will not
go with them something will happen to ** (him), and because they are also **
(his) friends ** (he) went with them."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The most that perhaps may be said about the affidavits, as
evidence against the affiants, is that they are admissions that the latter were
in fact at the scene as the crime was being perpetrated.  This is of no help to <span style="">the prosecution's cause -- in so far as
concerns implication of the affiants themselves in the killing of Pedro
Nacional, Jr. -- for the affidavits fasten responsibility therefor directly and
exclusively on persons other than the affiants who, as repeatedly stated,
explicitly deny any participation therein, or even prior awareness that the
crime would be committed.  Worse, those
affidavits are categorically rejected and repudiated by their supposed authors
who variously asserted, also under oath, that the declarations attributed to
them were false and extracted under duress.  Moreover, it is impermissible to pick the affidavits apart, lending
credence only to the portions seen as incriminatory, while disregarding as
false and unacceptable those supportive of innocence, absent, as here, any
circumstance which would logically justify such dismemberment.  But this, it would appear, is what the Trial
Court did; with no further explanation than an advertence to the
"totality" of the contents of said affidavits and the recovered
physical evidence -- it in effect hung a finding of conspiracy against
appellants Cavite, San Juan and Villar on those portions of the </span>affidavits
<span style="">that would lend themselves to an
inference of such circumstance and ignored their exculpatory parts.  This is manifest error because said
statements each considered in complete context, or "in totality" as
it were, recount nothing more culpable than that the affiants were unwilling,
or unwitting, witnesses to a crime in the planning and commission of which they
had no conscious involvement.  Such
finding of conspiracy thus lacking any clear or sufficient basis where those
affiants are concerned, a verdict of guilt against them, as to whom there is no
other evidence to contradict their claim of never having laid a hand on the
victim, cannot be allowed to stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor, it goes without saying, may the flight of the other suspects
or the concealment of the victim's firearm and telescope, be considered as
incriminatory circumstances against any of the present appellants, although
they may be considered confirmatory of the affiants' story of the commission of
the crime by Pedro San Jose and others. "The rights of a party cannot be
prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another **<span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><i>Res inter alios acta alteri nocere
non debet.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the two other appellants, Luna Echanez and Julio Tanteo,
the affidavits of Cavite et al. are for the most part innocuous, and are in
truth hearsay as to Echanez and Tanteo, no opportunity having been accorded to
them to cross-examine the affiants, and were properly and seasonably objected
to as such.  There is thus no evidence
of the participation of Echanez and Tanteo in the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">What has thus far been stated makes it largely unnecessary to
deal with the question of whether or not there has been here any violation of
the constitutional rights of suspects under custodial investigation, in
particular, of the right to counsel as set forth in the present Bill of Rights
and explained and developed in fairly recent jurisprudence.  It must be observed, however, that while the
Court is not prepared, on the basis of <span style="">the
record, to hold that what is required of police investigators by the guarantees
of the right to counsel was not substantially complied with, there is at least
some reason to reiterate here the apprehensions expressed and admonitions given
in its recent rulings</span><a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">concerning
what it termed the "perfunctory * * </span><i>pro-forma</i>" <span style="">and "stereotyped" compliance with
the prescribed norms, particularly by way of giving the requisite advisories to
suspects about their right to counsel.  Specifically, what </span>emerges from the prosecution's evidence of the
circumstances surrounding the custodial investigation of the three affiants,
Cavite, et al., suggests that the counsel who assisted them -- the same for all
three as it turned out -- was less their free choice, as he should have been,
than the arbitrary one of their investigators.  However, as already stated, a deeper inquiry into this aspect of the
case would not change the conclusions already reached on other grounds
concerning the merits of this appeal.</p>
