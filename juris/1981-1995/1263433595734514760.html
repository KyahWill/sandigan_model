jeepney, Gerardo Nomat, Sr. and his three sons, namely, Gerardo, Jr., Fermin
and Santos, all surnamed Nomat were charged of the crime of Murder with
multiple attempted Murder before the Court of First Instance of Antique,
docketed as Criminal Case No. 109.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fermin Nomat was also charged with the crime of Frustrated
Homicide in Criminal Case No. 124 for the shooting of one Josephus Paciente.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the two cases arose from the same incident, they were
tried jointly by agreement of the prosecution and defense, with the conformity

portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 109,

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As gleaned from the records, the facts are as follows<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 29, 1970, at about 6:30 in the evening, Antonio Ricarze,
Jr. (Mao), Vicente Azurin, Jr., Nelson Dava and Joaquin Villavert (Bebo) were
standing in front of the provincial hospital of San Jose, Antique waiting for a
ride.  Vicente Azurin Jr., stopped a
jeep owned by Gerardo Nomat, Sr. and driven by Santos Nomat.  Beside the latter at that time was Cesar
Borromeo, a suitor of his sister and who later became his <span style="">brother-in-law.  Antonio Ricarze, Jr. asked Santos Nomat whether his group could
be brought to the San Jose Academy where a benefit show was being held.  Santos Nomat agreed but Ricarze Jr. asked
Cesar Borromeo to transfer to the back seat which Santos resented, but Ricarze
Jr. pushed Borromeo just the same</span> to the back.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arriving in their house, Santos Nomat immediately reported
the incident to his father in the presence of his brother, Fermin Nomat and
Mrs. "Bucay" Rodriguez, sister of Joaquin Villavert.  Gerardo Nomat, Sr., Fermin, Santos and Mrs.
Rodriguez lost no time in proceeding to the house of Mayor Oscar Salazar of San
Jose to complain about the alleged abuses of Dava, Azurin, Jr., Villavert and
Antonio Ricarze, Jr.  They likewise
proceeded to the house of Engineer Antolin Dava, father of Nelson Dava.  When informed that the latter was at the San
Jose Academy, the group proceeded to the house of Petong Villavert, father of
Joaquin, where Gerardo, Sr. informed Petong what his son and his group did to
Cesar Borromeo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Gerardo Nomat, Sr. and his two sons, Fermin and
Santos, went to the San Jose Academy, venue of the benefit show, at about 8
o'clock in the evening armed with guns and with the intention of seeing
Engineer Antolin Dava.  Gerardo Nomat
Sr., was holding a gun about 6 inches in length with his right hand, while
Fermin's gun was tucked in his waist.  The trio inquired from Ms. Angelica Paranque, one of the attendants in
the sale of the tickets, whether Nelson Dava, Antonio Ricarze, Jr. and Vicente
Azurin, Jr. had already entered.  When
informed by Ms. Paranque that they were inside, Fermin Nomat said, "We
will look for them inside," but was stopped by Abraham Sanchez, another
attendant.  The trio returned to their
jeep with the intention of waiting for Ricarze Jr.'s group but Fermin Nomat saw
Nelson Dava coming out of the "tunnel" of the San Jose Academy and
Fermin shouted, "Nelson come out", while aiming his gun at the
direction of Nelson.  Gerardo Nomat, Sr.
alighted from the jeep and said "No more talking, shoot him at once."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Miss Paranque told Gerardo Nomat, Sr. to "just take it easy" but
Nomat, Jr. said, "It will not last till morning, I will kill him."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, April 30, 1971, at about 5:30 in the afternoon,
Gerardo Nomat, Jr., together with his brothers, Fermin and Santos and Nestor
Navarro went to the Modern Life Restaurant after coming from the cockpit.  While they were drinking beer, Fermin showed
off his gun which is about 6 inches long, and so did Gerardo, Jr., who also
took out and displayed his revolver which was of the same kind as that of
Fermin.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 8 o'clock that evening, Josephus Paciente and his first
cousin Antonio Ricarze, Jr. entered the public market and while walking towards
the interior of the market, they met Gerardo Nomat, Jr. and Fermin Nomat.  Gerardo, Jr. remarked, "Mao, what did
you do to my visitor?" Ricarze answered, "I did not do anything to
your visitor."  Suddenly, Fermin,
who was at a distance of 1 1/2 brazas from Ricarze, Jr., fired .38 caliber
revolver at the latter and hit him.  Almost simultaneously, Gerardo Nomat, Jr. also drew his .38 caliber gun
and fired at Ricarze, Jr.  Gerardo
Nomat, Sr. and Santos Nomat ran to the direction of Fermin holding their
respective .38 cal. revolvers and likewise fired at Ricarze, Jr. who reeled and
fell to the ground.  Gerardo Nomat, Jr.
continued firing at the fallen Ricarze, Jr., while the former stood about 2
meters away from the right foot of the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While Fermin Nomat and Gerardo Nomat, Jr. were firing at Antonio
Ricarze, Jr., the assistant market collector in the public market, Leandro
Lazo, Jr., was in the premises and only about 4 or 5 meters away from Fermin,
about 10 meters from Gerardo Nomat, Jr. and was 8 meters distant from Ricarze
Jr.  He was in between Gerardo, Jr. and
Antonio Ricarze, Jr. and was therefore in the line of fire coming from Gerardo,
Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
As he crouched and tried to seek cover, Lazo, Jr., was hit by a bullet and
wounded, the nature of which is that described in a medical certificate,
Exhibit "L".<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He laid flat on his back and after the firing stopped he was brought to the
Antique Provincial Hospital for treatment.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After Fermin Nomat fired at Ricarze, Jr. he faced Paciente and
said, "You also."  As Paciente
tried to run, Fermin fired at him and hit him on the left side of his body,
about four (4) inches below the nipple towards the left.  After he was hit, Paciente ran towards the plaza
where he was able to ride on a tricycle that brought him to the Antique
Provincial Hospital<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the incident, aside from the victims aforementioned, there
were other persons who suffered gunshot wounds caused by stray bullets
namely:  Jose Abagat, Leonila Fabila and
Leon Bungay.  Hernani Abello, resident
physician of the Antique Provincial Hospital gave them medical attention and
issued their respective medical certificates.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fermin Nomat went to the municipal hall where he surrendered to
Cpl. Jose del Rosario of the San Jose Police Force, stating that he had shot
Ricarze Jr. inside the public market due to a personal grudge.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fermin Nomat claims self-defense while the other three accused,
Gerardo Nomat, Sr., Gerardo Nomat, Jr. and Santos Nomat, predicated their
defense on denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in their defenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since appellant Fermin Nomat admitted that he alone shot Ricarze,
Jr. in self-defense,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
it was incumbent upon him to prove by clear, sufficient, satisfactory and convincing
evidence his plea of self?defense<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that excludes any vestige of criminal aggression on the part of the person
invoking it.  Appellant must rely on the
strength of his own evidence, and not on the weakness of the prosecution,
because even if it were weak, it could not be disbelieved after the appellant
admitted the killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant must show that there was unlawful aggression against
him; that there was reasonable necessity of the means he employed to prevent or
repel the unlawful aggression and there was lack of sufficient provocation on
his part.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense tried to show that the deceased was at that time
armed with a gun and was the one who first drew his weapon and fired twice at
Fermin; that two of the companions of Ricarze Jr. namely, Liberato Reyes and
Edgardo Reyes each fired at Fermin and at least four (4) shots were fired at
the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
If that were so, it was highly incredible that not one of the shots hit
Fermin.  Moreover, the testimony of
Fermin Nomat and his witnesses as to the manner he shot the deceased Ricarze,
Jr. appears to be inconsistent with the physical findings with respect to the
trajectory of the bullets that found their way through the body of the deceased
Ricarze Jr.  The version of the defense
is that the shots were fired by Fermin while Ricarze, Jr. although reeling, was
still in a standing position.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This runs counter to the findings of the NBI Medico?Legal Officer, Dr.
Mariano Cueva that "this was inflicted when the victim also could have
been in a lying down position, either lying on his body or on his left side of
the body with the assailant at the position of the feet of the victim on the
right side."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Except for the bare testimony of Fermin, no proof was presented
to show that Ricarze, Jr. had a gun during the incident.  The only gun that Sgt. De los Santos saw
when he arrived at the crime scene immediately after the shooting was the .38
caliber revolver used in the shooting that Gerardo Nomat, Sr. and Fermin were
grappling for possession.  Likewise,
defense witness Pat. Ramon Tamugdan, testified that when he arrived at the
scene of the shooting after hearing three gunshots<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and therefore would have been in a position to witness the incident because no
less than seven shots were fired, he did not find any gun in the premises, much
less in the body of Ricarze, Jr.  If
Ricarze had a gun and used it, it is impossible that the same could not have
been found at the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused Fermin Nomat, in his effort to save his co-accused,
testified that he was the only one who fired shots at the victim with his
revolver.  This appears to be in
conflict with the physical findings concerning the bullets "R1"
(Exhibit "B") and "AR" (Exhibit "D") which were
extracted from the body of the deceased, which, according to the Supervising
Ballistician Felicisimo Lunasco of the NBI were fired from a caliber .38
revolver other than the exhibit .38 caliber revolver (Exhibit "A")
which according to the defense, was the one used by Fermin Nomat in shooting
the deceased Ricarze Jr.  In fact,
according to the NBI Ballistic Report No. B-373-670<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
submitted by Ballistician Felicisimo Lunasco, the two specimen bullets found in
the body of the deceased were not fired from the specimen gun but could have
been fired from two different guns.  These
findings show that at least three (3) .38 caliber revolvers of the Smith and
Wesson make were used in the killing of the victim Ricarze, Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the evidence presented by the accused Fermin Nomat to
prove self-defense falls short of that standard required of the accused who
interposes self? defense as a justification for an otherwise criminal
act.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the defense interposed by the accused Gerardo Nomat,
Sr. and Gerardo Nomat, Jr., the same pales into insignificance in the face of
the overwhelming and convincing evidence presented by the prosecution showing
their guilt.  The testimonies of the
defense witnesses in support of the defense of said accused could not stand
scrutiny by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witness, Pat. Ramon Tumogdan testified that when he heard
the first shot and two other gunshots, he was in the municipal building and so
he rushed to the public market passing thru Carretas Street.  He said that all in all he heard only three
(3) shots.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
This is belied not only by the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses but
even by the defense witness who testified that several shots, about 15 to 20
shots, were fired during the incident.  That this witness was not telling the truth is further shown by the fact
that according to him it took him 20 minutes to run the distance from the
municipal building to the place of the incident which incidentally, is found to
be only 10 meters.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Certainly, it will not take 20 minutes for one to run a distance of only ten
meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another defense witness Alberto Tumogdan who tried to corroborate
the testimony of the accused Gerardo Nomat, Jr. testified hearing shots and
seeing Ricarze, Jr. for the first time with a black revolver about 6 inches in
length on his right hand<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
as he was falling down.  As he fell down
the gun he was holding was thrown from his hand and was picked up by somebody.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
But on cross examination, the witness could not remember the color of the
shirt, nor the color of the pants, or the length of the hair of Ricarze, Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court finds it hard to believe that the witness can describe the color and
length of the firearm used and the hand that held the gun but cannot remember
other details of the person of the deceased, thereby placing in doubt whether
he actually saw what he testified to.  It appears that the witness was presented merely to testify on the fact
that Ricarze, Jr. was holding a black revolver on his right hand to support
Fermin Nomat's allegation of self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
of defense witness Angel Davila appeared to be biased and not convincing
enough.  It is hard to believe that
during all the time that Fermin Nomat and the deceased were trading shots, that
this witness stayed at the place of the incident and witnessed even the
minutest detail of the shooting including the conversation that occurred
between the two, the exact number of shots fired by Fermin and Ricarze Jr.
together with the latter's companions, what the companions of Ricarze Jr. did,
the exact distance not only between Fermin and Ricarze Jr. but also the distance
between the two and the companions of Ricarze during the shooting and other
details without said witness running for cover for dear life, which under the
circumstances, considering the frightening suddenness of the shooting could not
have been testified to even by an eyewitness unless he is coached and
rehearsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is hard to believe that Ricarze Jr. would angrily approach,
confront and grab Fermin by his shirt and saying "I will kill you"
right in the presence of the latter's father, Gerardo Nomat Sr. without said
father taking any action, considering that he is one person who would not take
lightly the slightest affront to his family.  In fact, the minor incident that happened the day before to his son
Santos and family guest, Cesar Borromeo, made Gerardo Nomat, Sr. angry that he
went into a hunting spree looking for the members of Ricarze's group in an
apparent attempt to redress a wrong done to his family.  What more of an affront done to his son in
his presence.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the point of reliability and naturalness the testimonies of
the prosecution eyewitnesses appear to be more natural and reliable.  The reaction of eyewitness Josephus
Paciente, Edgardo Reyes, Liberato Reyes and Romeo Villavert to the incident is
far more in keeping with the natural course of things.</p>

<p class="BODY">Take the testimony of prosecution witness Liberato Reyes as to
the position of Gerardo Nomat, Sr. when he fired at Ricarze Jr.</p>

<blockquote>"COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.  When you said you saw Gerardo Nomat fired at Ricarze, where was Nomat in
relation to the body of Ricarze?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.  Gerardo Nomat, Sr. <i>was at the place towards the right foot of the
body of Antonio Ricarze, Jr.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This testimony of prosecution witness Liberato Reyes is confirmed
by<i> </i>the findings of Dr. Cueva, Jr. who testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.  Now taking into account the track or direction of the bullet that
entered the wound No. 3 into the body of the deceased can you possibly tell
this Court the relative position of the assailant and the victim when wound No.
3 was inflicted?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.  Because of the acute upward course of the bullet from the right flank to
the left shoulder, this suggest that in all probability this was inflicted when
the victim as could have been in a lying down position either lying on his back
or on his . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. Left side of the body?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. Left side of the body <i>with the
assailant at the portion of the feet of the victim on the right side</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The court gave credence to the testimony of Liberato Reyes not
only because it is natural and convincing but also because it is confirmed by
no less than the NBI Medico-Legal Officer, Dr. Mariano Cueva, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense is that victim Antonio Ricarze, Jr.
had a gun with him which he used in trading shots with Fermin Nomat.  But no such gun was recovered from the body
of the victim nor within the vicinity of the incident where the shooting
occurred.  Defense witness Pat. Ramon
Tomugdan<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
who was one of the several police officers who arrived first at the scene of
the crime and whose testimony that somebody picked up the gun of the victim
could not be given full faith and credence on the basis of his incredible
testimony as previously described.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense at the start of the trial said at the NBI conducted a
paraffin test on the three accused and that they are going to present the
results of the same in their defense.  But the paraffin results were never presented before the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another aspect of this case that seems to support the version of
the prosecution and tend to militate against the theory of the defense is the
fact that motive has been shown on the part of the accused to commit the act
attributed to them.  Overwhelming is the
evidence submitted that the family of the Nomat was angered by that incident
that happened to their family guest Cesar Borromeo.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if that incident did not happen, the finding of guilt
will still stand in the face of the positive identification of the accused,
Gerardo Nomat, Sr., Gerardo Nomat, Jr. and Fermin Nomat by the prosecution
witnesses as the persons who shot the late Ricarze, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Gerardo Nomat, Sr. had been informed that their family
guest, Cesar Borromeo, had been abused by Ricarze's group, he and his sons went
looking for the said group.  The
testimony of prosecution witness Myrna Orcasitas concerning the arrival of
Gerardo Nomat, Sr., Fermin Nomat and Santos Nomat in the San Jose Academy<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
and the testimony of Nestor Navarro with respect to the incident the following
morning where the Nomat brothers armed with their revolvers waited for
Ricarze's group in the Modern Life restaurant show premeditation and conspiracy
on the part of the father and his sons to kill Ricarze, Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Added to these is the presence of all the accused during the shooting incident.</p>

<blockquote>"While conspiracy to commit a crime must be established by
positive evidence, direct proof is not essential, since by its nature it is
planned in utmost secrecy.  Consequently, competent and convincing circumstantial evidence will
suffice to establish it."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Where the issue boils down to a question of credibility of witnesses,
the appellate court will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court,
considering that the latter is in a better position to decide the question,
having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during the trial, unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts
of substance and value that, if considered might affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the decision
appealed herefrom, the guilt of the accused, Gerardo Nomat, Sr., Gerardo Nomat,
Jr. and Fermin Nomat having been proven beyond reasonable doubt, the decision
of the trial court is hereby AFFIRMED, with the modification that indemnity to
be paid by all the accused to the heirs of the date Antonio Ricarze, Jr. is
