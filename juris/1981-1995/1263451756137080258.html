				<BR><STRONG>ERICTA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Lucila Valero alias Rosing and Alfonsito Valero alias
"Pipe" were accused in the Municipal Court of San Rafael, Bulacan in
two separate complaints, one of double murder and the other of frustrated
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the preliminary investigations, the complaints against
Alfonsito Valero were dismissed "on the ground that he is a deaf-mute and,
therefore, all the proceedings against him were beyond his
comprehension".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lucila Valero
remained as the sole defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the trial in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan where the records were
later forwarded for appropriate proceedings, the trial Court convicted Lucila
Valero of the complex crime of double murder and frustrated murder and imposed
upon her the extreme penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, <span class="GramE">this automatic review</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning of <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1969</st1:date> between <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time>
of Saturday, Michael, aged 9 months, and Annabel, aged 1 year and 9 months,
both of whom are the children of Ceferino Velasco, died of poisoning after
eating bread containing endrin, a commercial insecticide. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Likewise, Imelda, another minor child of
Ceferino, tasted the poisoned bread and would have died as a consequence were
it not for the timely medical assistance given her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these three minor children were in the
balcony of their house at <st1:city><st1:place>San Rafael</st1:place></st1:city>,
Bulacan, when they partook of the poisoned bread.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same morning at about the same time that the three minor
children partook of the poisoned bread, three (3) puppies of Ceferino Velasco
under the balcony also died of poisoning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier that same morning at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 o'clock</st1:time>, Ceferino Velasco, father of the victims, was seen throw­ing
poisoned rats into a river near his house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Investi­gations were conducted by Cpl. Bucot and Pat. Arturo Ventuso,
both of the Police Department of <st1:city><st1:place>San Rafael</st1:place></st1:city>,
Bulacan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their arrival, they saw
the dead bodies of Michael and Annabel in the house of Ceferino Velasco and the
dead puppies under the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
also saw several pieces of sliced pan scattered in the sala of the house, near
the balcony, and under the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
picked up some pieces of sliced bread under the balcony, wrapped them in a
piece of paper and submitted them to a chemist for examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was found that the bread contained endrin,
a poisonous insecticide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two minor
children, Michael and Annabel, were also autopsied and the necropsy reports
showed that both children died of poisoning by endrin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Samples of the blood and internal organs of
both Michael and Annabel were also examined by a chemist and it was found that
they contained endrin.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The evidence of the prosecution and the defense
conflict as to the source of the poisoned bread.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the prosecution shows that
the poisoned bread was given to the children by Alfonso Valero alias Pipe, a
deaf-mute brother of the defendant Lucila Valero, and that it was Lucila Valero
who gave the bread to Pipe for delivery to the minor children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the defendant Lucila
Valero denies that she ever gave bread to her deaf-mute brother, Pipe, for
delivery to the minor children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence for the defense tends to show that the Velasco children might have
eaten one of the sliced poisoned bread used by their father in poisoning rats
in his garden.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that Ceferino Velasco has a vegetable garden in
his yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He uses an insecticide called
Polidol to spray the vegetable and uses the same insecticide to kill rats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the testimony of the defen­dant,
which was never rebutted by Ceferino Velasco, Ceferino also planted vegetables
in the yard of the defendant whose house is just across the street from the
house of Ceferino Velasco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further
testified that Ceferino dipped sliced bread into an insecticide called endrin,
dried them up and later used the poisoned bread as a bait to kill rats in the
yard located by the side of his house.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">More of the controversial facts will be presented in the
following discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY">We first discuss and assess the evidence for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the nine witnesses
for the prosecu­tion three witnesses, namely Rodolfo Quilang, Federico Jaime,
and Ceferino Velasco were presented to prove that the defendant Lucila Valero
gave the poisoned bread to her deaf-mute brother Pipe with the alleged
instruction to deliver the bread to the Velasco children.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now analyze the testimonies of these three witnesses:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Rodolfo Quilang</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Only Rodolfo Quilang, among the nine prosecution witnesses,
testified that he saw the defendant Lucila Valero deliver "something
wrapped in a piece of paper"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to her deaf-mute brother Pipe with the alleged instruc­tion <u>by sign language</u>
to deliver the same to the Velasco children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Quilang never saw what was inside the piece of paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time Quilang saw the delivery to Pipe
of the wrapped object, the defendant and her brother were in the balcony of
their house, which was just near the gate of Ceferino Velasco's house where he
(Quilang) was standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of
the wrapped object, Pipe allegedly proceeded towards Velasco's house.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Quilang, he was "in the act of leaving"
Velasco's gate when Pipe "was entering the gate of Ceferino Velasco".<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not Quilang saw the delivery to the Velasco children
of the "something wrapped in a piece of paper" is a question that
involved this star prosecution witness into a series of self-contradictions, aptly
called by the appellant's counsel as a "series of basic somersaults"
which earned for Quilang a reprimand from the trial Judge, who, surprisingly
later, based the conviction mainly on the testimony of this flipflopping
witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his affidavit, dated March 8, 1972 (Exhibit "4", p.
437, Record of murder case) or three (3) years after the poisoning of the
Velasco children, Quilang stated that <u>he actually saw</u> Pipe deliver the
wrapped object to the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
statement reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Na nakita kong si Pipi ay nagpunta sa bahay
nina Ceferino Velasco at dala-dala ang inabot ni Lucilang nakabalot sa papel,
at noong dumating sa may hagdanan ni Ceferino, ay nakita kong iniabot ang
nakabalot sa mga bata na anak ni Ceferino Velasco."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Three years later during the trial on <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1975</st1:date>, he declared on
cross-examination, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you left the residence of Demetria and Severino (sic) Velasco, Pipe <span class="GramE">was</span> just entering the gate of that house, is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, you did not see Pipe give that something wrapped in a piece of
paper to anybody in the premises because you have al­ready left?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Really
not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are
you sure of that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
did not really see."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When confronted with the contradiction, Quilang re­iterated that he
did not see Pipe deliver the bread, in the following testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
did not answer the question, you stated in open court that you did not see Pipe
<span class="GramE">give</span> the bread to the children of Ceferino and
Demetria Velasco, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
really said that."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On being pressed further to explain the
contradiction, Quilang made the absurd explanation that the self-contradictory
statements were both correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
you, of course, realized that you said that under oath?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
in your statement, dated March 8, 1969 (should be March 8, 1972) which was also
under oath, you stated that you saw Pipe gave that thing wrapped in a piece of
paper to the children of Severino (sic) and Demetria Velasco, are you telling
that that is also true?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The judge must have been so flabbergasted
with the inconsistencies that he, himself, propounded the follow­ing question:</p>

<blockquote>"Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Court will ask you, did you see Pipe hand over to the deceased children that
something which was wrapped in a piece of paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The confusing inconsistencies prompted
the Court to proceed further as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
while ago, you were asked by Atty. Rodrigo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You clearly state that you did not see Pipe hand over this wrapped thing
in the paper, do you remember that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Court is now confused, which of these statements it will believe, do you
realize that these two statements are contradictory to each other?"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After some evasive answers in his attempt to extricate himself
from this web of self-contradictions, the Court insisted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
are not answering the question, in fact, I remember having asked you whether or
not you saw Pipe hand over this something wrapped to the children and you said
that you did not see, and now you say you saw, can you explain these
inconsistent statements?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
truth of the matter was that he handed over."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Convinced that Quilang was a lying witness, the trial Judge could
not help but explode an expletive in Tagalog during the cross-examination, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Atty. Rodrigo:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you see that wrapped thing being given or you were just guessing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
saw that he handed over.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
I thought, Mr. Quilang, that when Pipe was just entering the gate of Ceferino
Velasco, and Demetria Velasco, you were already departing from the place and
that you have already left, and this is the reason why you did not see Pipe
handed over that something wrapped on a piece of paper,</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was not able to say that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Ano ka ba?</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Narinig <span class="GramE">kong</span> sinabi
mo iyon ah!"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The tendency of Quilang to prevaricate is shown not only in his
self-contradictory statements on the witness stand but also in the other
portions of the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
statement of Quilang (Exhibit "4", p. 437, Record of the Murder case)
is dated <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This date appears twice in the affidavit,
first at the end of the affidavit and second, in the jurat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both places of the affidavit, the words
"March" and "1972" are type­written by the same typewriter
used in typing the entire affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
date, however, was left blank so that originally what appeared at the end of
the affidavit and in the jurat was practically "March ___ 1972".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparent­ly, the affidavit must have been
prepared in March of 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The date
"8", presumably the date of the swearing before the Fiscal, was
typewritten with a different typewriter on the blank space.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the witness stand, Quilang stated that he made an affidavit on
<st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1969</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
He must have made this statement to make it appear that he was not an
"eleventh-hour witness" as alleged by the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When confronted with the discrepancies in the
date appearing in his affidavit, to wit, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="3">March
 8, 1972</st1:date>, and his testi­mony on the witness stand, he insisted that
the correct date was <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1969</st1:date>
and that either the Fiscal or the one acting in his behalf committed the error
in indi­cating the date in his affidavit.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It is incredible that a Fiscal administering the oath-taking on <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1969</st1:date> and signs, the
jurat postdates the oathtaking to <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="3">March
 8, 1972</st1:date>, three years later.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are other equally strong considerations indicat­ing the
lack of credibility of Quilang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
what the appellant's counsel calls an "eleventh-hour witness".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the complaint for frustrated murder and
the complaint for murder, both dated March 11, 1969, were filed with the
Municipal Court of San Rafael, Bulacan, Rodolfo Quilang was not listed as one
of the several witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quilang never
made any statement to the police who initially investigated the case <span class="GramE">nor</span> to the Philippine Constabulary which made its own
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Municipal Court
asked searching questions from several witnesses during the first stage of the
preliminary investigation on <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="3">March 12,
 1969</st1:date>, only Ceferino Velasco, Concepcion Velasco, Delfin Señorosa, Federico
Jaime and Demetria Manalastas were investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodolfo Quilang was not one of them.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, when the information for frustrated murder (pp. 87 to 88,
Record of Frustrated Murder case) and the information for murder (p. 76,
Records of Murder case) were filed in February 1971, the star witness, Rodolfo
Quilang, was not listed among the nine (9) prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on September 15, 1975 or six (6) years
after the tragedy, Quilang was suddenly sprung as the star witness, the only
witness who allegedly saw the delivery by the defendant to Pipe of
"something wrapped in a piece of paper" with the alleged instruction
by sign language to deliver the same to the Velasco children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without the testimony of Quilang, there would
be no evidence to show that the poisoned bread which was alleged­ly delivered
by Pipe to the Velasco children came from the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realizing that there was a missing link, the
prosecution thought of presenting Quilang to provide the missing link six years
after the occurrence of the tragedy.</p>

<blockquote>"This witness, Aniceto Decalos, a neighbor and old friend of
Ciriaco Jimenez, like the alleged eyewitness Candido Autor, did not figure in
the list of witnesses for the prosecution, either in the criminal complaint
filed by PC Capt. Golez or in the Fiscal's indictment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His name was not amongst those who gave
affidavits to back up the criminal charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This gives the impression that Aniceto Decalos, the neighbor of the
deceased, was but an eleventh-hour witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To take his testimony on its face value, we fear, is to rate truth so
lightly."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Federico Jaime and Ceferino Velasco</u></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, both Ceferino Velasco and Federico Jaime did
not see the delivery by the defendant to her deaf-mute brother "something
wrapped in a piece of paper".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
never saw or heard her giving any instruction to Pipe to deliver the wrapped
object to the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both claimed
that they <u>learned or obtained the information</u> from Pipe after
interviewing him <u>by means of sign language</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which the trial Court accepted as competent,
trustworthy and credible!</p>

<p class="BODY">The following testimony of Federico Jaime speaks for itself:</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the foregoing testimony point­ing to the
defendant Lucila Valero as the source of the poisoned bread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is evident is nothing but
confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What Jaime asked from Pipe
was "Who gave the bread to the children?" The evidence of the
prosecution already shows that Pipe gave the bread to the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply, it seems that Pipe pointed to the
defendant who was standing nearby.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the confusion is clear.<span style="">&nbsp;

to the children because the evidence of the prosecution shows that Pipe <span class="GramE">himself</span>, gave the bread to the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that Pipe did not understand the
sign language of Jaime and vice-versa.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Ceferino Velasco, father of the victims, did not
help the prosecution much either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following is Ceferino's testimony:</p>

<blockquote>Witness:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon seeing Ponsito, I
asked him what was that and he answered me that it was a piece of bread and he
told me that she was the one who caused the giving of the bread, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">witness</span> pointing to
the accused Lucila Valero)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Atty. Rodrigo, Jr.:</blockquote>

<blockquote>I would like to make of
record that during the narration as to how he asked Alfonsito, the witness was
only demonstrating by using his index finger moving up and down, <span class="GramE">your</span> Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fiscal Calderon, Jr.:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you first asked that question who gave the bread to you, how did Alfonsito
answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
having given the bread, I asked him who gave the bread, and he said that the
bread came from her (witness demonstrated by swaying his right arm and pointing
his forefinger sidewise.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
was Lucila Valero at the time that Alfonsito was demonstrating to you his
answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
was there on the side of the street, sir.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the aforequoted testimony indicating that the
deaf-mute, Pipe, pointed to her sister Lucila Valero as the source of the
poisoned bread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined the
entire transcript of the stenographic notes, and, except the aforequoted
portions of the testi­mony of Federico Jaime and Ceferino Velasco, there is
nothing in the record showing that Pipe communicated to the prosecution
witnesses by comprehensible sign language that his sister was the source of the
poisoned bread.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the foregoing observation, there are several
compelling reasons that should have made the trial Court reject the testimony
of both Jaime and Velasco.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pipe who was the alleged source of the vital informa­tion for the
prosecution was never presented as a witness either for the prosecution or for
the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jaime and Velasco were
presented as prosecution witnesses to convey to the Court what they learned
from Pipe by sign language.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence is purely hearsay.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> The
presenta­tion of such evidence likewise violates the principle of <u>res inter
alios acta</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rights of a party
cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With particular reference to the testimony of Ceferino Velasco,
its admission cannot be justified by claiming that it is a part of the res
gestae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Pipe allegedly revealed to
Ceferino Velasco that the source of the poisoned bread was the defendant, the
children had not eaten or tasted it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nobody was yet poisoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated
otherwise, there was no startling occurrence yet.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to the testimony of Jaime, there is no showing
that Pipe made the extrajudicial revelation spontaneously when he was still
under the influence of a startling occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pipe made his extrajudicial revelation not spontaneously but after an
interview through the complicated process of sign language.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The failure of the defense counsel to object to
the presentation of incompetent evidence, like hearsay evidence or evidence
that violates the rule of <u>res inter alios acta</u>, or his failure to ask
for the striking out of the same does not give such evidence any probative
value.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lack of objection may
make any incompetent evidence admissible.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
But admissibility of evidence should not be equated with weight of
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearsay evidence whether
objected to or not has no probative value.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To give weight to the testimonies of Federico Jaime and Ceferino
Velasco, whether considered as hear­say evidence or as part of res gestae and
make the same the basis for the imposition of the death penalty grave­ly
violates the constitutional right of the defendant to meet the witnesses face
to face and to subject Pipe to the rigid test of cross-examination, the only
effective means to test the truthfulness, memory, intelligence, and in this
particular case, the ability of the deaf-mute, Alfonso Valero alias Pipe, to
communicate with the outside world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
conflict between a provision of the constitution giving the defendant a
substantive right and mere technical rules of evidence, we have no choice but
to give effect to the constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cross-examination of Pipe, the source of the vital
information for the prosecution, would have shown clearly his incompetence as a
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the preli­minary
investigation in the Municipal Court, experts on deaf-mutes like Belen Herreros
who is the official inter­preter of the only school for the deaf and the blind
in the Philippines, assisted by Mrs. Felicidad Vinluan who is the principal of
the school of the deaf and the blind, Mesdames Gilda Tatum and Salud Natividad,
examined Alfonsito Valero alias Pipe and reported to the Muni­cipal Court that
"questions addressed to him (Alfonso Valero) and answers given by him
cannot be accurately interpreted".<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the testimonies and the report made by the
aforementioned experts, the Municipal Court dismissed the murder and frustrated
murder cases against Alfonsito Valero, alias Pipe, who was then the co-accused
of Lucila Valero, "on the ground that he (Pipe) is a deaf-mute and,
therefore, all the proceedings against him were beyond his comprehension."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even prosecution witnesses Ceferino Velasco and Federico Jaime
admitted on cross-examination that their interpretations of the sign language
of Pipe were only guess work.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, Ceferino admitted on cross-examination:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a matter of fact, most of your interpretation would be only guess work on your
part, is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Jaime practically made a similar admission, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you were requested to demonstrate how you conveyed the idea to Pipe about the
giving of the bread to the children, you pointed to a height, is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
do you demonstrate to Pipe if you wanted to convey that what is to be taken is
star-apple?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fiscal Calderon:</blockquote>

<blockquote>I object, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">May
answer.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
that also, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">witness</span>
demonstrated to be putting something in his mouth.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, anything which will be taken by mouth, you just use the same sign
language?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
the same sign, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
that it would be safe to conclude that Pipe might have misunderstood your
signs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have misunderstood it
for rice, bibingka, <span class="GramE">star</span>-apple or for anything else?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>witness
gave no answer</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the trial Court committed the grave error of accepting,
and, worse still, of giving weight to the testimonies of Federico Jaime and
Ceferino Velasco inter­preting the alleged extrajudicial information to them by
sign language of Pipe, when the source of the information himself, Alfonsito
Valero alias Pipe, would have been an incompetent witness had he taken the
witness stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Jaime allegedly learned from Pipe that the latter's sister
was the source of the poisoned bread, the defendant was only at the gate of the
Velascos near Jaime but he did not confront her.</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
Pipe pointed to Lucila and when you gave the meaning to that sign that it was
Lucila who offered Pipe to give the bread to the children, did you (Federico
Jaime) confront Lucila immediately?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
it not occur to you (Federico Jaime) to confront Lucila considering that you

<p class="BODY">When confronted during the cross-examination with the previous
affidavit (Exhibit "1-d"), Ceferino Velasco admitted that he made the
answers in the affidavit.</p>

We may add that the in­consistency is on the very fact in issue, namely, the
guilty participation of Lucila Valero.</p>

<p class="BODY">When further repeatedly asked by the defense counsel why Ceferino
did not state in his affidavit (Exh. 1-d) that he learned that Lucila was the

<p class="BODY">Aside from the weakness of the evidence for the prose­cution,
there are other considerations which negate the guilt of the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no motive for Pipe and Lucila Valero to poison the
three children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Pipe and Lucila
Valero loved the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ceferino
Velasco admitted that even when Pipe was only a small <span class="GramE">boy,</span>
the latter frequented his house to visit his children.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
When the children were dying because of the poison, Pipe alternately fanned
Michael and Annabel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution, however, claims that the motive of the poisoning
was the quarrel in the morning of <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1969</st1:date> between Demetria Manalastas, mother of the victims, and
the defendant Lucila Valero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause
of the quarrel was the interference of the defendant to protect the children
from the scolding and maltreatment of their own mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interference was resented by Manalastas
prompting her to say to the defendant "Don't interfere in the matter because
I am scolding these children of mine."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
The defendant is not a relative of the Velasco children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her inter­vention in their behalf only shows
her affectionate concern for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendant quarrelled with Demetria Manalastas, not with the Velasco
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no motive whatsoever
for the defendant to poison the children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even Ceferino Velasco, father of the victims, stated that the cause of
the quarrel was "Wala pong kabagay-bagay" meaning, "very
trivial".<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
The quarrel was not a sufficient cause to commit a heinous crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">This leaves <span class="GramE">Us</span> speculating as to the
source of the poisoned bread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodolfo
Quilang stated that he saw the defendant give Pipe "something wrapped in a
piece of paper." According to Ceferino Velasco in his Affidavit of <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1969</st1:date>, Pipe gave to his
children "isa pong pandesal".<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
He practically reiterated this statement during his testi­mony on <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1975</st1:date> when he described what
Pipe allegedly brought as "just <u>one</u> piece of wrapped bread".<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But when the police investigated the premises of the house of
Ceferino Velasco in the morning of <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="2">February
 22, 1969</st1:date>, they found not only one pandesal but "several sliced
pan" scatterred in the sala, near the balcony, and under the balcony.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
According to the defendant, in her testi­mony not rebutted by the prosecution,
Ceferino Velasco, who as her tenant, dipped sliced pieces of bread in endrin,
dried them up and used them as bait in his barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1969</st1:date>, Ceferino Velasco threw into a
nearby river a long string of poisoned rats.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three puppies died of poison­ing under the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rats, the dogs, or maybe even his minor
children must have found the poisoned slices of bread somewhere in the barn or
in the house, scattered them, and the children, not knowing the danger of the
poison, ate them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thought that he might have poisoned his own children must
have caused Ceferino Velasco some kind of trauma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So galling to a father is the thought that
he, himself, might have caused the death of his two children and the near death
of a third child, albeit unintentionally, that his natural reaction is to
escape from it by throwing the blame to someone else not only to appease his
own conscience but also to avoid embarassment before his relatives, friends and
neighbors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tragic poisoning of the three children is un­fortunate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tragedy was compounded when the trial
Court imposed the death penalty on the accused although the evi­dence against
her does not justify a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inspite
of the self-contradictions of Rodolfo Quilang on very material points noticed
by the trial Judge, himself, Quilang's obvious tendency to prevaricate, and the
fact that he is what the appellant's counsel calls an "eleventh-hour
witness", which is true, and inspite of the incompetence of the
testimonies of Federico Jaime and Ceferino Velasco whose testimonies are
hearsay evidence, and the practical impossibility of interpreting correctly the
sign language of Pipe, the trial Judge readily accepted their testimonies as
basis for im­posing the death penalty in gross violation of the hearsay rule
and the constitutional right of the accused to meet the witness face to face
(in the instant case, the deaf-mute, Pipe), and to cross-examine Pipe in order
to determine his ability to communicate with the outside world.</p>

<p class="BODY">Realizing that there is completely no motive for the defendant to
commit the heinous crime, the trial Judge conjured up something as the probable
cause that might have impelled the defendant to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conjecture of the Judge is stated, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"There is something disquieting about those seemingly unfading
smiles on the face of the accused; with her sharp, penetrating look, her
unsolicited smiles are clues to her real personality; they forebode some out-of­-the
ordinary dispositions in the inner recesses of her mind; perhaps, only a
trained psychiatrist or an experienced psychologist could fathom or decipher
the meaning of this characteristic of the accused; it is un­fortunate that the
prosecution and the defense have chosen not to delve into the personality of
the accused; however, because of these queer manifestations on the facial
expressions of the accused, could she have intended to produce the gravity of
her felonious act; had she a fore­knowledge that the poisons used to kill rats
or insects would also cause death to the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was her intention merely to cause some malady
or discomfort to the children to shout and vent her hatred on the mother of the
<span class="GramE">children.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
are some questions that find no definite answer from the records of these
cases; <u>these questions notwithstanding, the court strongly feels that it is
not entirely improbable for the accused to possess a violent</u> or cruel
disposition x x x".<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In effect, motive was not necessary to compel the defendant to
commit the crime because according to the observation of the Judge, she was
suffering from some kind of psychiatric abnormality or mental disorder that can
make her violent.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is most unfair for the trial Judge to unexpected­ly spring the
aforementioned observation in his decision without having mentioned it in the
course of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a procedure is
unfair to the accused, for she is there­by deprived of her chance to either
deny or affirm the truth of such a very material finding which has important
bearing in the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This procedure
of the trial Judge practically denies the accused the right to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The surprising finding of the trial Judge goes far beyond mere
observation on the manner a witness testified, which admittedly may be
considered subjectively by the Judge in evaluating the credibility of the
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surprising finding of the
Judge relates not only to the credibility of a witness but to the sanity of the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its aim is not only to weigh
the testimony of the witness but to establish a motive for the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding that the prosecution has not
established the guilt of the defendant, <span class="GramE">We</span> hereby
reverse the decision of the trial Court and instead render judgment of
acquittal without cost.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court's judgment of conviction was based on the following facts proven by the
prosecution:</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses Ceferino Velasco and Demetria Manalastas resided in
the poblacion of <st1:city><st1:place>San Rafael</st1:place></st1:city>,
Bulacan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Across the street from their
house was the house of their neighbor, Lucila Valero, whom they had known for a
long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1969</st1:date>, Lucila and Demetria had a
heated altercation when Deme­tria scolded and maltreated her children and
Lucila interfered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Demetria resented the
interference of Lucila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A policeman paci­fied
the two women.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of the following day, February 22, Deme­tria went
to the public market where she worked as a vendor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband Velasco went to the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Left in their house were their five small
children named Benilda, Concepcion, Imelda, Annabelle and Michael.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>
that morning, Rodolfo Quilang was at the gate of the house of the Velasco
spouses because he wanted to collect five pesos as the price of two chickens
which he had sold to Demetria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
waiting for her, Quilang saw Lucila and her deaf- mute brother Alfonsito in the
balcony of their house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quilang saw Lucilla giving Alfonsito something wrapped in a piece
of paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfonsito crossed the street,
went up the house of the Velasco spouses and proceeded to the balcony where the
Velasco children were playing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quilang
noticed that Alfonsito gave to the children pieces of bread which had been
wrapped in a piece of paper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quilang left the gate and while on his way to the house of
Demetria's sister, he met Velasco coming from the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velasco went to the corral and fed his
carabao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw his children playing in
the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also saw Alfonsito
offering a piece of bread, first, to Concepcion, 7, who refused it because she
had already eaten her breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
Alfonsito offered it to Imelda who accepted it, tasted it and then dropped it
on the floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Annabelle, about twenty months old, picked it up, divided it and
gave a part of the bread to the baby, Michael, nine months old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two ate the pieces of bread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After eating the bread, Benilda noticed that
Annabelle and Michael turned pale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
mouths frothed or had bubbles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benilda
instinctively felt that something was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She called her father who was at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco went up and directed Benilda to take Annabelle to the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velasco panicked and cried for
help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several persons came to his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them, Federico Jaime, on
learning the cause of the Velasco children's plight, confronted Alfonsito and,
by means of sign language, Jaime learned that the bread given by Alfonsito to
the children came from Lucila who at that time was in the balcony of her house
witnessing the commotion in the house of Velasco.</p>

<p class="BODY">Annabelle was not admitted to the hospital because medical
treatment would have been futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was brought home almost dead and placed beside the baby Michael who was already
dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">Imelda was brought to the clinic of Doctor Artemio Marcelo who
was able to arrest the toxic effects of the poison.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He treated her for about three months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luckily, she survived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doctor Marcelo testified that she would have
died of toxemia had not timely medical treatment been administered to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigation revealed that the same <span style="">piece of </span>bread which Alfonsito had given to the children was eaten
by some dogs which also<span style=""> </span><span style="">died </span>of poisoning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Doctor Ernesto Brion, a medico-legal officer, and Andres
Santiago, a chemist, both of the National Bureau of Investigation, examined the
internal organs of Michael and Annabelle and found that they were poisoned as a
result of their having eaten pieces of bread containing endrine, an
insecticide.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lucila denied any complicity in the poisoning of the Velasco
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She declared that she and her
brother had no motive for killing the children who were very dear to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lucila <span style="">said </span>that Demetria was mad at her (Lucila) because Lucila charged
interest on the money which Demetria had borrowed from Lucila's sister-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">She testified that Velasco, who was her tenant on a parcel of
land used as a vegetable garden, used endrine on bread which was then dried and
later<span style=""> </span>placed as <span class="GramE">a bait</span> in the barn and that several rats were killed by
means of the bread dipped in the endrine solution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge noted that Lucila had a "sharp, pene­trating
look" and on the witness stand was always grinning (she had "unfading
smiles").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found
that there was no doubt that Lucila gave the poisoned bread to her deaf-mute
brother who had no criminal intent and who did not know that the bread was
poisoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfonsito exhibited some
compassion for the children after he noticed that something had happened to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Lucila did not
make any effort to help the victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not err in concluding that Lucila's guilt was
proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court and the Solicitor General regarded the two
murders and the frustrated murder as a complex crime resulting from the single
act of Lucila in giving the poisoned bread to Alfonsito with the instruction
(made in sign language) that the same be fed to the Velasco children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the death penalty was imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The single criminal impulse of Lucila to poison the Velasco
children gave rise to a complex offense (See People vs. Peñas, 66 Phil. 682;
People vs. Pincalin, L-38755, January 22, 1981, 102 SCRA 136).</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote for the imposition of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>perpetua</u>
</span>on the accused, Lucila Valero.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court did not award any indemnity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Lucila </span>should be adjudged liable to pay an
indemnity of P24<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the Velasco spouses for the
death of Annabelle and Michael and to pay an indemnity of P10,000 to Imelda
Velasco.</p>
