<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the validity and constitutionality of the issuance and
service of the search and seizure warrants issued by the CFI-MANILA were
contested in and upheld by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. SP-09153-R
entitled "Hercules Bottling Co. Inc., et al., v. <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Savellano</span>, et al." HERCULES filed a petition for

captioned as "Hercules Bottling Co., Inc. v. The Court of Appeals,"
the Court dismissed the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the City Fiscal of Manila proceeded with the
preliminary investigation of the criminal cases, where private respondent, The
Distillers <st1:place>Co.</st1:place> Ltd. of <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
claiming to be the owner and exclusive manufacturer of Johnnie Walker Scotch
Whiskey, was the private complainant [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61.]
With the dismissal of HERCULES’ petition, the Bureau of Customs also resumed
hearing the seizure and forfeiture proceedings over the said articles.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present controversy arose when private respondent, on <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="6">11 June 1982</st1:date>, objected to the
continuation by the Collector of Customs of the seizure proceedings claiming,
among others, that these proceedings would hamper or even jeopardize the
preliminary investigation being conducted by the fiscal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Collector of Customs ignored the
objections.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to stop and enjoin the Hearing Officer of the Bureau of
Customs from taking further action in the seizure proceedings of the subject
goods, private respondent on 24 September 1982 filed a petition for prohibition
with preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order, docketed as
Civil Case No. 82-12721.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be
noted at this juncture that the petition was heard not before the CFI-MANILA
which originally issued the search warrants, but before another <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, that of respondent judge of the Regional Trial Court,
Branch 35, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge issued a temporary restraining order on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="9">29 September 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, a writ for preliminary
injunction was issued as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner filed an answer on <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="11">12
 November 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On 20 July
1987, respondent judge rendered a decision holding that the Collector of
Customs acted in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing the warrant of seizure
and detention considering that the subject goods had already come under the
legal custody of the CFI-MANILA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
petitioner represented by the Solicitor General, filed the instant petition on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">11 August 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Howard <span class="SpellE">Sosis</span> and

issued by the CFI-MANILA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent contends that respondent judge may properly take cognizance of the

prevent the Bureau of Customs from doing anything prejudicial to the successful
prosecution of the criminal cases [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 123.]</p>

enjoin the Collector of Customs from continuing with its seizure and forfeiture

that respondent judge has failed to adhere to the prevailing rule which denies
him jurisdiction to enjoin the Bureau of Customs from taking further action in

has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions touching on the
seizure and forfeiture of dutiable goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding these considerations, respondent judge
entertained private respondent's petition for prohibition holding that the
seizure and forfeiture proceedings instituted in the Bureau of Customs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>null
and void because the subject goods were earlier seized by virtue of the
warrants issued by the CFI-MANILA in Criminal Cases Nos. 8602 and 8603.</p>

<p class="BODY">This holding is erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it be assumed that a taint of irregularity may be imputed
to the exercise by the Collector of Customs of his jurisdiction to institute
seizure and forfeiture proceedings over the subject goods because he had
accepted custody of the same under conditions specified in the CFI-Manila order
dated January 29, 1979, it would not mean<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">
</span>that respondent judge was correspondingly vested with the jurisdiction

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is no legal basis for respondent judge's
conclusion that the Collector of Customs is deprived of his jurisdiction to
issue the assailed warrant of seizure and detention, and to institute seizure

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the CFI-MANILA was not divested of its

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, since the Collector of Customs herein had
actual possession and control over the subject goods, his jurisdiction over the

contrary to law [<u>See</u> Papa v. <span class="SpellE">Mago</span>, G.R. No.
