<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General summarized the antecedent facts of the case
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Between 5:30 and 6:00 in the morning of March 22, 1985, Felomena
Franche was tending her store at Dau Homesite, Dau, Mabalacat, Pampanga.  Her daughter, Mila Pineda, lived in a house
some 20 meters from the store, with the door of the store facing the
house.  Saldy Guela, Mila’s nephew and
grandson of Felomena, was staying in the same house.  Suddenly, Saldy heard a woman shouting, ‘Mila, Mila, somebody is
hitting your mother’s head.’ Upon hearing this, Saldy stood up and looked out
the window.  He saw a man inside the
store hitting the head of his grandmother, Felomena Franche, with a two?foot
long piece of wood.  When the man was
about to get out of the store, Saldy saw his face and recognized him as ‘COT’,
who frequently drank liquor at the store.  He went downstairs but upon reaching the ground, ‘COT’ was already
scaling the wall.  Thus, Saldy proceeded
to the store where he carried his grandmother (tsn., Jan. 18, 1989, pp. 4-7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On her part, Mila Pineda was awakened by a noise to the effect
that there was a robbery committed at the store which her mother, Felomena
Franche, was tending.  When she peeped
through the window, she saw many people in front of the store.  A woman then approached her, saying, ‘Go
down.  Your mother was hit.’ Thus, Mila
proceeded to the store to look for her mother.  There, she saw that her mother was ‘nangingisay’ or trembling all over
(tsn., Nov. 20, 1986, pp. 4-5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It turned out that the one who shouted, Mila, Mila, your mother is
being beaten’ or words to that effect, was Dolores C. Lising.  Dolores went to the store of Felomena
Franche that morning to buy sugar.  There, she heard somebody pounding, as if ‘somebody was pounding a rat,’
and an old woman moaning.  When she came
near, she saw a man beating the old woman with a piece of wood.  Knowing that the old woman was the mother of
Mila Pineda, she ran towards the latter’s house which was located near the
store and shouted to her (tsn., Oct. 6, 1987, pp. 5-10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“About 6:00 that same morning, Natividad dela Cruz, who was on her
way to the store of Felomena Franche, saw appellant Virgilio Alay-ay, alias
‘Cot’, whom she had known since 1972, jump over the fence of said store.  Appellant was carrying a Sanyo transistor
radio which Natividad recognized as the property of Felomena, because she
always saw Felomena use it whenever she Natividad) went to the store (tsn.,
Feb. 16, 1988, pp. 3-9).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Meanwhile, Mila Pineda, Saldy Guela and a neighbor, Jimmy,
succeeded in reviving the unconscious Felomena.  Afterwards, Mila and another neighbor brought Felomena to the
Pampanga Polymedic Hospital.  On the way
to the hospital, Mila asked her mother ‘Who hit you?’ and she answered, ‘It was
Cot’ (tsn., pp. 16, 19-20).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At the Pampanga Polymedic Hospital, Dr. Carmelo Mendiola attended
to Felomena Franche.  At past 8:00 that
same morning, the case was referred to Dr. Eduardo Buencamino, who found
Felomena unconscious, in shock, with multiple injuries on the face and head and
blood coming out from her nose and mouth.  He ordered resuscitative measures which, however, proved
unsuccessful.  At 10:10 that morning,
Felomena Franche was declared dead.  In
his medical certificate (Exh. B), Dr. Buencamino found at least two fractures
on the head of Felomena which could have been caused by her being beaten by
someone with a piece of wood.  The
doctor ruled out the probability of Felomena’s having fallen down by<i> </i>herself
and her head hitting the cement floor, because the injuries sustained were
caused by multiple hitting (tsn., Sept. 10, 1987, pp. 9-19, 35-37; Exh. A).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Virgilio Alay-Ay was found guilty and sentenced to life
imprisonment.  The dispositive portion
of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered convicting the accused of Robbery
with Homicide as defined and punished under Article 294 (1) of the Revised
Penal Code as amended, and this Court sentences the accused VIRGILIO ALAY-AY

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant assails the credibilities of the prosecution
witnesses who testified against him.  He
contends that:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x Saldy Guela was a surprise witness for the prosecution.  His name does not appear in the Police
Report (Information Report) neither x x x (was) his name ever mentioned by the
witnesses for the prosecution.  x x x
Guela did not even report the incident in question to the police nor did he
ever execute a statement regarding his testimony in Court.  The incident happened sometime on March 22,
1985, and (he) testified only on January 19, 1989 x x x (or after) a period of
about four years x x x.  He was a close
relative of the victim (she) being his grandmother x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x Natividad dela Cruz x x x testified that she saw a person
jump over the fence of Felomena Franche, x x x (that this person’s) name is
Virgilio Alay-ay; that she saw him bringing a radio; that after seeing the accused
jump over the fence and run away towards Duhat St., said witness went home;
that witness did not reach the store because she proceeded home; and that she
came to know later that Felomena Franche died.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x the defense will submit that such testimony is highly
improbable x x x (because the witness did not) report the matter to the owner
of the property or to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">x x x </span>authorities
x x x (but rather) went home and x x x proceeded to continue her regular chores
of collecting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">x </span>x (the) witness
Mila Pineda gave her conflicting testimony when she testified that while on
their way to the hospital, she allegedly asked her mother who hit her and her
mother allegedly answered that it was “Cot.” However, during cross examination
x x x (half a year later), the same witness x x x (testified that when she
asked her mother if “Cot” was the one who hit her, her mother just nodded).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x witness Dolores Hipolito Lising testified that while buying
sugar at the store of the victim on March 22, 1985 at or  about 5:30 o’clock in the morning she heard
a pounding sound and heard somebody yelling.  That while she was near the store x x x (saw) someone hitting the old

11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Refuting said arguments point by point, the Solicitor General
argues as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>As to Saldy Guela</u>
-- It is not true that Saldy Guela’s name was not mentioned by any witness for
the prosecution.  Mila Pineda, the first
one to testify for the prosecution, declared that her nephew, Saldy Guela, and
a neighbor, Jimmy, were with her when she was trying to revive her mother, who
was then unconscious (tsn., November 20, 1986, p. 16).  Also, the fact that Saldy Guela testified
only on January 19, 1985, (should be January 18, 1989) i.e., four (4) years
after the incident on March 22, 1985, is immaterial.  The trial commenced on November 20, 1986 with the presentation of
Mila Pineda as first prosecution witness.  Since the prosecution had seven (7) witnesses, with Saldy Guela as the
last, and considering postponements of the hearing, there is nothing irregular
about the date when Saldy testified.  As
to Saldy’s relationship to the victim, the same does not affect his
credibility.  Mere relationship is not
sufficient to discard the testimony of credible witnesses, especially where
there is no showing that these witnesses have testified merely by reason of
relationship or alleged interest in the case, other than a desire to see that
justice is done (People vs. Pajenado, 69 SCRA 172).  Testimony of a witness who, although related to the victim, is
without ulterior motive in testifying against the accused, is given credence
(People vs. Moises, 66 SCRA 151).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:
3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>As to Natividad
dela Cruz</u> -- It may be true that after Natividad saw appellant jump over
the fence of the victim’s store carrying the latter’s Sanyo radio, she did not
immediately report the matter to the authorities.  But such inaction is not unusual.  The initial reluctance of witnesses in this country to volunteer
information about a criminal case, and their unwillingness to be involved in or
dragged into a criminal investigation is common and has been judicially
declared not to affect credibility (People vs. Kipte, 42 SCRA 119).  Besides, Natividad, not long after the incident,
gave her statement before Pfc. Gabriel Balilo, relating what she saw on March
22, 1985 (Exh. E).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:

x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There may be a little inconsistency between Mila’s declaration on
direct examination that when she asked her mother who hit her, the latter
answered, ‘It was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Cot’ (whose real
name, Virgilio Alay-ay was known to Mila), and her statement on
cross-examination that when she asked her mother if it was ‘Cot’ who hit her,
the latter nodded her head.  Nevertheless, what is important is the end result, which is that before
she died, the victim identified her assailant, namely, appellant Virgilio
Alay-ay, alias ‘Cot’.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>As to Dolores
Hipolito Lising</u> -- The fact that this witness was not able to recognize the
man whom she saw beating Felomena Franche with a piece of wood does not make
her less credible than the others.  Witnesses have varying perceptions of the same event, depending on their
location, mental and physical condition, etc.  In fact, her candidness in not pretending to recognize the assailant
renders her testimony believable.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well-settled is the rule that findings of the trial court on the
issue of credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect and are accorded
the highest consideration by appellate courts.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Credibility “is a matter that is peculiarly within the province of the trial
judge, who had first-hand opportunity to watch and observe the demeanor and

<p class="BODY">Against these positive testimonies identifying accused-appellant
as the person who hit the victim on the head with a piece of wood and took her
transistor radio when he made good his escape from the store, is
accused-appellant’s flimsy alibi that he was somewhere else sleeping at his friend’s
house at the time the incident happened.  As correctly observed by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>“Appellant insists that he has a valid defense -- that of
alibi.  According to him, he slept at
the house of Reynaldo Salunga between 10:00 p.m. of March 21, 1985 and
6:00-6:30 a.m. of the following day, March 22, 1985, and thereafter he told
Reynaldo that he was going to Bamban, Tarlac.  Reynaldo’s house is located at Dau Homesite, Dau, Mabalacat, Pampanga,
where the victim’s store is situated.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x Since the scene of the crime (the victim’s store) is located
in the <u>same</u> <u>subdivision</u> -- Dau Homesite, and the incident
happened between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. of March 22, 1985, it was not physically
impossible for appellant to be at the crime scene at the time of its
commission.  In a defense of alibi, the
accused must show that it was impossible for him to be at the scene of the
crime (People vs. Malibay, 63 SCRA 420; People vs. Sarmiento, 64 SCRA 350).  This appellant clearly failed to do.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court, for its part, is not precluded from rendering a
judgment of conviction based solely on the testimony of a single witness as
long as such testimony is found to be credible and satisfies the Court that the
accused is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of the crime charged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The Court, however, disagrees with the decision of the trial
court convicting the accused-appellant for the crime of robbery with
homicide.  Incidentally, the proper

Court stated that:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x.  To sustain
conviction for the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, it must be

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it cannot be said with moral certainty that
accused-appellant’s intention was to steal the radio and money and that the
killing of the victim was a mere incident to the robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is testimony<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> by
Saldy Guela that the accused-appellant had been frequently drinking at the
store tended by the victim for about three (3) months prior to the
killing.  There is also testimony<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>Mila Pineda that
accused-appellant had always been quarreling with the victim and it could have
been due in part to the fact that accused-appellant had been enamored of her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given these two variables, a possible scenario could have been
the following:</p>

<blockquote>Accused-appellant went very early to see the victim at the store
that fateful day.  He might have tried
to physically display his affections, if one could call it that, toward the
victim.  She must have resisted, or
worse, laughed him off, and he must have resented it.  One thing might have led to another with the end result that he
hit her with a piece of wood.  In his
escape, he grabbed her Sanyo transistor radio, as a souvenir,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

and the P100 peso-bill to provide for his fare to Bamban, Tarlac.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What We are pointing out is that there is a dearth of evidence to
show that the accused-appellant had the intention to steal cash and other
valuables in the store and that he killed the victim on occasion of the
robbery.  As such he cannot be convicted
of the crime of robbery with homicide but of two specific crimes, that of
homicide and theft.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for homicide is <i>reclusion temporal</i>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Accordingly, we fix his penalty at six years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i>,

mitigating nor aggravating circumstances, the penalty imposable is <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">arresto mayor</span></i> in its maximum
period.  The Indeterminate Sentence Law
does not apply as the penalty actually imposed does not exceed one (1) year.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
