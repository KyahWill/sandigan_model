the ground of gross immorality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant, a second year medical student of the Southwestern

that respondent Atty. Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span>, then chairman of

knowledge of her for several times under threat that she would fail in her
Pathology subject if she would not submit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to
</span>respondent's lustful desires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant further alleged that when she became pregnant, respondent,
through a certain Dr. Gil <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>, had her undergo
forced abortion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the Resolution of the Court dated July 9,
1974, respondent filed his Answer denying any personal knowledge of complainant

complainant is a woman of loose morality.</p>

abdominal examinations and x-ray examination of the <span class="SpellE">lumbro</span>-sacral
region of complainant showed no signs of abnormality (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 42).</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the respondent as reported by the Solicitor
General is summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Caban</span>
testified that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In December, 1972,
respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> stayed at Ambassador Hotel
with his wife and children; respondent never came to Manila except in December,

(p. 13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Nov. 24, 1977; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.
pp. 42-43).<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Oscar <span class="SpellE">Salangsang</span>, another witness for the
respondent stated that:</blockquote>

went to Ambassador Hotel to meet respondent:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>the latter had male companions at the hotel but he did not see any woman
companion of respondent <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span>:<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He usually slept with
respondent at the Ambassador Hotel and ate with him outside the hotel together
with <span class="SpellE">Caban</span> (pp. 8-9, 13-15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="1">Jan. 13, 1978</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 43).<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that throughout the period of the investigation
conducted by the Solicitor General, respondent <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span>
was never presented to refute the allegations made against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Answer, respondent <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> alleges
that he does not have any knowledge of the allegations in the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As special defense, respondent further
alleged that the charge leveled against him is in furtherance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">of </span>complainant's vow to wreck
vengeance against respondent by reason of the latter's approval of the
recommendation of the Board of Trustees barring complainant from enrollment for
the school year 1973-1974 because she failed in most of her subjects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise contended that the defense did
not bother to present respondent in the investigation conducted by the
Solicitor General because nothing has been shown in the hearing to prove that
respondent had carnal knowledge of the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to respondent's averments, the Solicitor General made a
categorical finding to the effect that respondent had carnal knowledge of
complainant, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing, it is clear that complainant was
compelled to go to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> with
respondent upon the threat of respondent that if she failed to do so, she would
flunk in all her subjects and she would never become a medical intern (pp. 42,
50, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="6">June
 6, 1975</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As respondent was
Chairman of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Medicine</st1:placename></st1:place>,
complainant had every reason to believe him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has been established also that complainant was brought by
respondent to Ambassador Hotel in Manila for three days where he repeatedly had
carnal knowledge of her upon the threat that if she would not give in to his
lustful desires, she would fail in her Pathology subject (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
"A", "K", "K-1" to "K-6" pp. 51, 52,
55-59, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1975;).</blockquote>

<span style="mso-tab-count:4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, respondent did not bother to appear during
the hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is true that he
presented <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Caban</span>
and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Salangsang</span> who testified that respondent
usually slept with them every time the latter came to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
but their testimony (sic) is not much of help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>None of them mentioned during the hearing that they stayed and slept
with respondent on February 12 to <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1973</st1:date> at Ambassador Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> <span class="SpellE">xxx</span> <span class="SpellE">xxx</span> Besides, <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Caban</span> testified that respondent stayed at Ambassador Hotel
with his wife and children in December, 1972.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The dates in question, however, are <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="2">February 12 to 14, 1973</st1:date>, inclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">His (<span class="SpellE">Caban's</span>)
testimony, therefore, is immaterial to the present case" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>. pp. 43-44).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In effect, the Solicitor General found that the charge of
immorality against respondent <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> has been
substantiated by sufficient evidence, both testimonial and documentary; while
finding <span class="SpellE">insufficent</span> and uncorroborated the accusation
of intentional abortion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor
General then recommends the suspension of respondent from the practice of law
for a period of not less than three (3) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court Resolved to require the parties to Move in the premises to determine
whether any intervening event occurred which would render the case moot and
academic (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 69).</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 12, 1989, the Solicitor General filed a manifestation
and motion praying that the case at bar be considered submitted for decision on
the bases of the report and recommendation previously submitted together with
the record of the case and the evidence adduced (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.
p. 75).</p>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough review of the records, the Court agrees with the
finding of the Solicitor General that respondent <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span>,
under the facts as stated in the Report of the investigation conducted in the
case, is guilty of "grossly immoral conduct" and may therefore be
removed or suspended by the Supreme Court for conduct unbecoming a member of
the Bar (Sec. 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent failed to adduce evidence sufficient to engender doubt
as to his culpability of the offense imputed upon him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the exception of the self-serving
testimonies of two witnesses presented on respondent's behalf, the records are
bereft of evidence to exonerate respondent of the act complained of, much less
contradict, on material points, the testimonies of complainant herself.</p>

<p class="BODY">While respondent denied having taken complainant to the
Ambassador Hotel and there had sexual intercourse with the latter, he did not
present any evidence to show where he was at that date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While this is not a criminal proceeding,
respondent would have done more than keep his silence if he really felt
unjustly traduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the duty of a lawyer, whenever his moral character is put
in issue, to satisfy this Court that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is
</span>a fit and proper person to enjoy continued membership in the Bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot dispense with nor downgrade the
high and exacting moral standards of the law profession (Go v. <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>, 21 SCRA 439 [1967]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As once pronounced by the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"When his integrity is challenged by evidence, it is not
enough that he denies the charges against him; he must meet the issue and
overcome the evidence for the <span class="SpellE">relator</span> (Legal and
Judicial Ethics, by Malcolm, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">p. </span>93)
and show proofs that he still maintains the highest degree of morality and
integrity, which at all times is expected of him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> In the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. <span class="SpellE">Tria</span>, 17
Phil. 303, Justice Moreland, speaking for the Court, said:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An accused person sometimes owes a duty to himself if not to
the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he does not perform that
duty he may not always expect the State to perform it for him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It he fails to meet the obligation which he
owes to himself, when <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span>meet it
is the easiest of easy things, he is hardy indeed if he demand and expect that
same full and wide consideration which the State voluntarily gives to those who
by reasonable effort seek to help themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is particularly so when he not only declines to help himself but
actively conceals from the State the very means by which it may assist
him" (<span class="SpellE">Quingwa</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>,
19 SCRA 439 [1967]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommends that since the complainant is
partly to blame for having gone with respondent to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
knowing fully well that respondent is a married man with <span class="GramE">children,</span>
respondent should merely be suspended from the practice of law for not less
than three (3) years (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 47).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent in his manifestation and motion
dated April 18, 1989 alleges that since a period of about ten (10) years had
already elapsed from the time the Solicitor General made his recommendation for
a three (3) year suspension and respondent is not practicing his profession as
a lawyer, the court may now consider the respondent as having been suspended
during the said period and the case dismissed for being moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant filed the instant case for disbarment not because
respondent reneged on a promise to marry (<span class="SpellE">Quingwa</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>More
importantly, complainant's knowledge of respondent's marital status is not at
issue in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Complainant submitted to respondent's solicitation for sexual intercourse
not because of a desire for sexual gratification but because of respondent's
moral ascendancy over her and fear</span> that if she would not accede, she
would flunk in her subjects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As chairman
of the college of medicine where complainant was enrolled, the latter had every
reason to believe that respondent could make good his threats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as counsel for respondent would
deem it "worthwhile to inform the Court that the respondent is a scion of
a rich family and a very rich man in his own right and in fact is not
practicing his profession before the court" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 70), mere suspension for a limited period, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">per</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><u>se</u>,
would therefore serve no redeeming purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that he is a rich man and does not practice his profession as a
lawyer, does not render respondent a person of good moral character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidence of good moral character precedes
admission to bar (Sec. 2, Rule 138, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court)
and such requirement is not dispensed with upon admission thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Good moral character is a continuing qualification
necessary to entitle one to continue in the practice of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ancient and learned profession of law
exacts from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">its </span>members the
highest standard of morality (<span class="SpellE">Quingwa</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">27, Rule

<blockquote>"A lawyer may be disbarred for grossly immoral conduct, or by
reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A member of the bar should have moral
integrity in addition to professional probity.</blockquote>
