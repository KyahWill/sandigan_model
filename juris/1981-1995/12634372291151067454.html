<span class="SpellE">Verdida</span> and the wounding of <span class="SpellE">Efelito</span>

other accused, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid</span>,
was not apprehended and remain at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution established that on <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1987</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span>,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid</span>, all armed and wearing black masks, barged into the
house of <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verdida</span> and announced a robbery.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

<span class="SpellE">Jessa</span>, Ray, Roy, <span class="SpellE">Jeson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Efelito</span>) had just finished taking .their supper.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon seeing the intruders, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> crawled on the
floor and tried to seek shelter in another room. Antonio ran after her and
started stabbing her. <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> sustained stab wounds
on the back and on the esophagus. Her hands were also severed. In the process,
Antonio's mask fell off his face.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, an Information for Double Murder with Frustrated
Murder was filed against Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid</span>. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 4th day of, September, 1987, in the
evening, particularly inside the house of spouses <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verdida</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span> at <span class="SpellE">Purok</span> 6, <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Inawaan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabuaya</span>, <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Batanagan</span>, municipality of Valencia, province of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, together with PEDRITO GAID Alias

confederating and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill by means of
treachery and evident premeditation, armed with a knife, bolo and unidentified
rifle, with which they were conveniently provided and wearing black masks, did
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and criminally
stab, hack and shoot <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>,
inflicting upon their persons, mortal wounds, which caused their instantaneous
death;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on the occasion, the above-named accused, armed with the
same weapons, with intent to kill, by means of treachery, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and criminally shoot <span class="SpellE">Efelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>, hitting both his
feet, which wounds would have caused his death, but nevertheless did not
produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the accused and the
timely assistance accorded the victim <span class="SpellE">Efelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>, to the damage and prejudice of the victims in the
amount they are entitled under the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The crime was committed with the aggravating circumstances of
nighttime and dwelling.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to and in violation of Article 248, in relation to
Articles 48 and 6 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, only Antonio and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span>
were apprehended and tried. Accused <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid</span> remain at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the prosecution established the <span class="SpellE">aforenarrated</span>
facts, the two (2) accused adduced their respective evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span> relied on the
defense of alibi. He claimed that on said date and time, he was residing in his
father's house, his father then suffering from cancer of the liver. The whole
morning of <st1:date month="9" day="4" year="1987">September 4, 1987</st1:date>,
he allegedly weeded out grass in their <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>. He
returned to his father's house at around <st1:time hour="17" minute="30">5:30</st1:time>
in the afternoon, washed up, took supper and went straight to bed. The next
day, he followed the same schedule. In the morning, he went to the field and
weeded out the grass. He went back to his father's house for lunch. At about <st1:time hour="14" minute="0">two o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, he was
apprehended by the police authorities while watching a game of cards at a
neighbor's house. He admitted that he knew spouses <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>. They
resided in the same barrio and his father's house was just three (3) kilometers
from his father's house.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span>' testimony was corroborated in
substance by his brother <span class="SpellE">Geonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span>, on the other
hand, presented a different version of the incident. He claimed that on the
date and time in question, he went to the <span class="SpellE">Verdida's</span>
residence to pay his debt. He requested <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span> to make an accounting of his outstanding
obligation. Thereafter, he handed to <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> the sum
of twenty-five pesos (P25.00) as partial payment for his debt and promised that
he would make good on his entire obligation after the harvest. <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> allegedly got mad and hurled insults against him.
This resulted in a heated exchange of words. Suddenly, <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>
came into the room and started hacking him. He used <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>
to shield himself from <span class="SpellE">Epimaco's</span> hacking blows. He,
nevertheless, sustained several hacking wounds on different parts of his body.
He, thus, claimed that it was <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>, not <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span>, who hacked him.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered a decision, dated <st1:date month="4" day="16" year="1990">April 16, 1990</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Only accused Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gabas</span> interposed the
present appeal. He contends that:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">THE COURT ERRED IN RULING
THAT APPELLANT ROMEO GABAS WAS POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BY THE PROSECUTION
EYEWITNESS.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">THE COURT ERRED IN
FINDING APPELLANT ROMEO GABAS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF MURDER ON TWO
COUNTS AND FRUSTRATED MURDER.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, accused-appellant impugns the identification made
by eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>
that he was the one who stabbed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>. He points to the alleged discrepancy in the
circumstance which led her to recognize and identify the masked malefactors. It
is claimed that in <span class="SpellE">Miguela's</span> sworn statement<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
she deposed that despite the masks worn by the intruders, she recognized them
by their hair, voice and posture. At the trial, however, <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span>
testified that she was able to recognize and identify the intruders for, during
the commotion, their masks fell off. Hence, accused-appellant urges that his
identification by <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> should be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, we are faced with the issue involving the credibility of
the testimony of a prosecution eyewitness. The issue continues to confound
courts for a witness' credibility is a subjective, amorphous quality, often
defined as much by the preconceptions of the trial judge who perceive the
witness as the latter testifies. A witness' credibility may also be affected by
such factor as the plausibility of the theory and theme the witness was meant
to support.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Grappling the issue at bench, it bears emphasis that a sworn
statement or an affidavit does not purport to contain a complete compendium of
the details of the event narrated by the affiant. Affidavits, ordinarily in a
question-and-answer form, are usually and routinely prepared in police
precincts by police investigators. Not infrequently, the
investigator/interrogator propound questions merely to elicit a <b><i>general
picture</i></b> of the subject matter under investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, inconsistency between two statements' of a
witness should be determined, not by resort to individual words or phrases
alone, but by the <b><i>whole impression or effect of what has been said or
done</i></b>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Placing <span class="SpellE">Miguela's</span> allegedly inconsistent statements side
by side, we do not, find any real inconsistency between her two assertions. As
may be gleaned from the records, when the three intruders barged into the house
of the <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span> family, <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span>
was able to recognize them by their hair, voice and posture. This fact was the
subject of her sworn statement. However, it was also clearly established at the
trial that, during the affray, the masks of the intruders fell off. <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> testified that Antonio's mask fell off first when
he bent over to stab <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> at the back. Then she
saw Romeo's mask fall off while the latter was in the act of shooting her
father <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>. The last mask to fall off was that of
<span class="SpellE">Nitoy's</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, we find that, in the case at bench, the inconsistency
pointed out by accused-appellant as to how <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span>
was able to identify him as one of the malefactors is not sufficient to
discredit her testimony in court. When <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> was
asked on cross-examination why she did not relate in her affidavit the fact
that the intruders' masks fell off, she explained that she was not asked about
the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the omission of <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> to state in her
affidavit that the intruders' masks fell off does not necessarily justify the
conclusion that said circumstance did not actually take place. Indeed, there is
no rule of evidence to the effect that omission of certain particulars in an
affidavit would <span class="SpellE">estop</span> an affiant from making an
elaboration thereof during the trial. On the contrary, trial courts cannot
allow admission of sworn statements without the testimony of the affiant.</p>

<p class="BODY">All factors considered, we find <span class="SpellE">Miguela's</span>
identification of accused-appellant as credible in view of the visibility
coming from the light of the kerosene lamp and, more importantly, because all
the accused were familiar neighbors of the <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>
family. It bears emphasis to note that <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span> is a 14-year old girl who witnessed the senseless
killing of her parents. Despite the horror of witnessing such a gruesome
incident, <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> had the presence of mind to try and
defend, albeit unsuccessfully, her mother from the attack of the intruders who
unceremoniously barged into their house. Noticeably, no proof was adduced by
the defense to show that <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> had previously
harbored any grudge or ill-feeling towards any of the accused as to falsely
impute on them such a serious crime as murder. There is no reasonable basis to
disbelieve the testimony of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, accused-appellant's alibi, corroborated by a
relative, does not inspire credence. Time and again, we have held that for the
easily concocted defense of alibi to prosper, the requisites of time and place
should concur. In the case at bench, accused-appellant did not adduce evidence
to prove that it was impossible for him to be present at the scene of the crime
at the time of its commission. In fact, the records will bear that the distance
between the house of accused-appellant's father, where accused-appellant claims
he was at that time, and the residence of the <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>
family were located in the same barrio, being only about three (3) kilometers
apart.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Such being the case, it was not physically impossible for accused-appellant to
have been present at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the appealed decision is hereby MODIFIED
only with respect to the indemnity awarded to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Efelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdida</span>. It is
increased to one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) consistent with the
current policy of this Court. Costs against accused-appellant.</p>
