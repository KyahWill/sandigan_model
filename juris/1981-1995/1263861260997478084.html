ruling that, under the factual milieu, the subsequent filing by respondent,
Ignacio Go, of the case for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the
seized property before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
(CC No. R-22573) did not constitute a legal basis for the dismissal of the
action for annulment of the <span class="SpellE">Sheriff"s</span> sale he
had earlier filed before it (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-21705).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant facts may be <span class="SpellE">capsulized</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>suit
for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> filed on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="2"><span class="GramE">6 February 1978</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> before the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (Civil
Case No.</span> R-20041) for non-payment of rentals and expiration of the lease
contract, brought by petitioners, the <span class="SpellE">Ybanez</span>
brothers, as <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>, against respondent Ignacio Go,
doing business under the name and style of Globe Marketing Co., judgment was
rendered in petitioners' favor ordering <span class="GramE">respondent</span> Go
to vacate the leased premises and to pay P156,000.00 representing unpaid
rentals, attorney's fees, and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">A Writ of Execution was issued on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="4">24 April 1981</st1:date> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Go’s</span>
two (2) lots and two (2) warehouses at the reclamation area, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
were levied upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A Certificate of Sale
in favor of petitioners-<span class="SpellE">lessors</span> was eventually
executed by the Sheriff on <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="7">31 July 1981</st1:date>
and thereafter registered with the Register of Deeds of the City on <st1:date year="1981" day="4" month="8">4 August 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="4">26 April 1982</st1:date>,
unsuccessful in an Injunction suit he had earlier availed of, respondent Go
filed a Complaint for annulment of the Sheriff’s sale (Civil Case No. R-21705),
before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch XIII
(hereinafter referred to simply as the Annulment Suit), alleging irregularities
in the conduct of the auction sale and praying for an award of actual and moral
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="17" month="6">17 June 1982</st1:date>,
in the Annulment Suit, respondent Go filed a "Motion for Leave to Deposit
in Court Redemption Money," "including lawful interests and legal
charges due thereon on or before August 3<span class="GramE">,1982</span>,"
which was denied on <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="9">24 September 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By virtue thereof, the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> executed the Final Certificate of Sale on <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="10">5 October 1982</st1:date> (Annex "7",
Petition) and placed petitioners in possession of the seized properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="10">12 October 1982</st1:date>,
respondent Go tendered payment of P255<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, as
redemption money, to the Sheriff and asked for a deed of redemption in his
favor (Annex "3", Comment of Go in G.R. No. 82372), but was met with
refusal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then allegedly paid
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span>, on 13 October 1982, the sum
total <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>P300,350.00, in cash,
as shown by the latter’s receipt (Annex "4", ibid.), but which
payment <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> has denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the NBI certified <span class="SpellE">Cresencio's</span> signature on the receipt as genuine (Annex
"5", ibid.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Go <span class="SpellE">hied</span> back to the Sheriff asking for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> but the same
again proved futile.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it was that on <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="11">18
 November 1982</st1:date>, respondent Go instituted another Complaint (Civil
Case No. R-22573) before the same Court, Branch III, wherein he prayed for a
judicial declaration that he had validly redeemed the properties sold at public
auction from one of the petitioners, and for an Order requiring the Sheriff to
execute <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in his favor (briefly, the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>
Case).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 December 1982, the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Court,
upon <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> plea for reconsideration, granted the
Motion for Leave to Deposit (Annex "6", ibid.) at which point in
time, however, respondent Go maintained that he could no longer make the
deposit because of the payment he had allegedly made to <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="9">2 September 1983</st1:date>,
the two (2) cases were ordered consolidated before the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Regional Trial Court, Branch XIII (hereinafter, the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, on <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="7">6 July
 1984</st1:date>, resorted to a "Motion to Dismiss the Annulment
Case" raising the issue of inconsistency in the causes of action in the
two (2) cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that the
filing of the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> Case constituted an
abandonment of the Annulment Suit because, in alleging in the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> Case, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span>respondent Go did, that he had redeemed the property he had, in fact,
recognized the regularity and validity of the Sheriff's sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>
upheld that contention and dismissed the Annulment Suit on <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="12">10 December 1984</st1:date> on the main grounds of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">litis</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span>, </span>abandonment
of claim or demand, and cessation of the existence of a cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It opined:</p>

<blockquote>"A study of the allegations in the two (2) complaints can
easily reveal that the positions taken by the plaintiff Ignacio Go in the two
cases are contradictory to one another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In R-21705 he claims that the sheriff did not comply with certain
mandatory legal procedures in the auction sale and so the sale was void while
under R-22573 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">he alleges that he has
subsequently validly redeemed the properties subject matter of the auction sale
and by such redemption he has recognized the validity of the sheriff's sale.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"In fact as can be drawn from the
allegations in the complaint in Case No.</span> R-22573 the redemption was
absolute and unconditional.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Payment of
redemption was not made under protest neither was it made subject to the result
of Case No. <span class="GramE">R-21705.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"By his very act of unconditionally redeeming the property
Ignacio Go recognized and acknowledged the regularity and validity of the
public auction sale conducted by the sheriff on July 31, 1981." (Record,
pp. 207-208)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon respondent <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> appeal in CA-G.R.
No. CV-06107, respondent Appellate Court, in its Decision of 20 January 1988,
set aside the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Court's dismissal of the Annulment
Suit for having been improper.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the aforesaid judgment, two (2) Petitions for Review were
successively filed by petitioners before this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One, on 9 February 1988, by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ybanez</span> (docketed as G.R.
No. 82170), assigned to the Second Division, and the other, on 12 February
1988, by his brothers, petitioners <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crescencio</span> and Romeo (numbered G.R. No. 82372) originally
raffled to the First Division, both Petitions directed against respondent
Go.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Involving as they did the same
parties and an inter-related subject matter, the two cases were consolidated
before this Second Division, which had the lower-numbered case, upon­ ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> Motion of petitioners, dated 19 April 1988, and the
Resolution of the First Division on 25 May 1988.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On 3 August 1988, the First Division granted
due course to the Petition in G.R. No. 82372 and required the submittal of
Memoranda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Second Division did
likewise in respect of G.R. No. 82170 on 7 December 1988.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Go's</span>
Supplemental Memorandum was submitted on 26 July 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 August 1989 respondent Go filed before us an "Urgent
Motion for Issuance of an Order to Maintain the Status Quo and to Respect his
Possession as of the Filing of the Complaint on April 26, 1982," which
petitioners opposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being of the
opinion, however, that a decision on the merits was preferable, this Court
merely <span class="GramE">Noted</span> said Urgent Motion in its Resolution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>4 October 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated at the outset, we affirm respondent Court's Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In alleging in the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> Case
that he had validly redeemed the properties, subject matter of the auction
sale, respondent Go had not thereby "recognized and acknowledged the validity"
of that sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in his
"Motion for Leave to Allow Plaintiff to Deposit in Court Redemption
Money" filed in the Annulment Suit on 17 June 1982, but which said Court
initially denied, Go had indicated that as he was afraid of losing his properties
the deposit was intended to assure their redemption in the event that the
Annulment Suit was denied "without prejudice to the final determination of
the instant case involving as it does the issue of validity and legality of
said certificate of sale and related matters" (Motion, p. 2, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G.R. No. 82372, p. 110).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For him, the payment was a means of staying
the one-year period of redemption, "as there was no Judge in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> where the case was assigned" (Comment, p.
3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The circumstance
that said alleged payment of the redemption money was not unconditionally made,
i.e., neither under protest nor subject to the outcome of the Annulment Suit,
cannot be construed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as an </span>abandonment
of the latter case.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Go's</span> main objective was for annulment of the public auction
sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>
Case, which followed in the wake of his alleged payment, was in the nature of a
cautionary remedy specially considering that the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Court had initially denied his Motion to Deposit and that the properties
foreclosed are allegedly worth P5M compared to the judgment in Civil Case No.
R-20041 of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Court against respondent Go
for P156<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Nor are the causes of
action in the two (2) cases inconsistent with one another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly pointed out by </span>respondent Appellate
Court, there are issues in the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> Case that
are set apart from the question of the validity of the auction sale, which is
the subject of inquiry in the Annulment Suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The latter case alleged irregularities in the conduct of the public auction
sale in that the Sheriff without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>valid
levy and with the use of an expired Writ of Execution had violated rules on
execution as prescribed in Sections 11 and 15 of Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, <span class="GramE">Go</span>
prayed for actual and moral damages for the illegal padlocking of and damage to
the building as well as loss of spare parts and machineries.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, the </span>issues
raised <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>
Case call for a separate determination of such </span>questions as whether
respondent Go had, in fact, delivered the redemption money to one of the
petitioners; whether or not such delivery, if there had been one, had been made
on time, and whether or not another money judgment against respondent Go had
already been satisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> Case presented an alternative cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, given the factual situation, the two (2) cases were aptly
consolidated by the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Court to avoid unnecessary
costs and delay (Section 1, Rule 31, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
But rather than having dismissed the Annulment Case it should have proceeded to
the trial thereof on the merits so that the validity of the auction sale could
have been fully and decisively determined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If untainted by irregularities then the sale would be valid and the
question of redemption, particularly the factual questions raised in connection
therewith, may then be addressed in a full-blown trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But if the foreclosure proceedings were
fatally flawed, then the auction sale would have to be voided in which case the
matter of redemption would ordinarily lose relevance.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious then that the determination of the basic issue
raised in the Annulment Suit is crucial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon its resolution will hinge the question of redemption of the
properties sold at public auction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Deferment of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">proceedings in
the <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> case is, in fact, called for as the
Appellate Court had observed, until after the issues in the Annulment Suit
shall have been decisively resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the Trial Court may address itself to the controversy in the
<span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> Case and render </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">consolidated judgment disposing of the
related suits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the judgment of respondent Court of Appeals
