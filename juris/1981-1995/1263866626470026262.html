				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The matter of the financial components of the monthly pension to
be paid retired judges and justices was brought before the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
by the Office of the Court Administrator in a memorandum filed by Court Administrator
<span class="SpellE">Meynardo</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Tiro</span> on <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1990</st1:date> and in an urgent
memorandum filed on <st1:date year="1990" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 910<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>otherwise
known as the Special Retirement Law of Judges and Justices and which took
effect in 1935, granted a monthly pension for life to a judge or justice
qualified to retire from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 3 thereof, upon retirement the retiree shall receive a
five-year lump sum and upon survival of the five-year period, the retiree shall
receive a monthly pension during the rest of his natural life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Republic Act No. 5095, which amended
Republic Act No. 910 and took effect on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1967</st1:date>, the amount of the monthly pension was fixed at the value
of the monthly salary of the retiree at the time of retirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1978</st1:date>,
Republic Act No. 910 was again amended by Presidential Decree No. 1438.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it appears that two versions of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">said </span>decree were published in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Official Gazette, although </span>both were
dated <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1978</st1:date> and
bore exactly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the same </span>number.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Volume 74 of the Official Gazette, No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It will be noted that the
</span>version of Presidential Decree No. 1438 appearing in the earlier
publication of the Official Gazette (74 O.G. No. 30) is silent as to the
components of the monthly pension payable starting with the sixth year of
retirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>significant,
however, that based on the copy of Presidential Decree No. 1438 as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">published </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">74 </span>O.G. No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">30 </span>and

11.0pt">Law</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, since 1978 the </span>Government
Service <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Insurance System </span>(GSIS)
had always computed the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">first five-year
lump </span>sum retirement as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">highest salary, </span>plus
(2) highest representation and transportation allowances (RATA) and longevity
pay at the rate of five percent (5%) additional for every five (5) years of
continuous service as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">judge or </span>justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the five-year lump sum period, that is,
on the sixth year of retirement, the GSIS computed the monthly pension for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">t</span>he rest of the retiree's natural life
as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) highest salary, plus (2)
highest RATA, plus (3) longevity pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, longevity pay was granted by Section 42, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 starting in
1983 and, by the Court's resolution, is considered part of the salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present question arose when the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">Commission </span>on Audit (COA), thru its corporate auditor assigned to
the GSIS, issued a memorandum dated December 6, 1989, addressed to Mrs. Lourdes
<span class="SpellE">Patag</span>, Vice-President, Social Insurance Group II, of
the GSIS, informing the latter that, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1438
amending Section 3 of Republic Act No. 910, after the expiration of the initial
five-year period of retirement, that is, at the beginning of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sixth </span>year of retirement, the monthly
pension <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>judges and justices
shall consist only of the monthly salary which the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">retiree was receiving on the date of his retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the representation and
transportation allowances shall not form part of the monthly pension of a
retiree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the </span>COA was
relying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the version of
Presidential Decree No. 1438 as published in 74 O.G. No. 41.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his aforesaid memorandum, Court Administrator <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Tiro</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> recommends that the GSIS be allowed to
continue paying the monthly pension consisting of the highest salary, highest
longevity pay, and highest representation and transportation allowances (RATA)
which, as aforesaid, had always been the bases and components of the pension
payments it </span>had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">been making
since 1978 when the amendatory </span>decree took effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He invokes the liberal interpretation of the
law adopted by the court and the reasons given <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
in "In Re:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Application for Life
Pension Under Rep. Act 910, RUPERTO G. MARTIN, Applicant," (A.M. No.
747-Ret., July 13, 1990), the decision wherein entitled former Justice <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> G. Martin “to receive a monthly pension for the
rest of his natural life, as provided by law, based on his highest monthly
salary <u>plus </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the highest
monthly aggregate of transportation, living and representation allowances</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was receiving on the date of his retirement” (Emphasis </span>ours).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It
will be recalled that Justice Martin was </span>granted a ten-year lump sum
gratuity by reason of permanent disability under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provisions of Section 3 of Republic Act No. 910, as amended by Presidential
Decree No. 1438, which even provides for "no further annuity payable
monthly during the rest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of the
retiree's life."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The most that can be said for the hereinbefore quoted provisions
of the second version of Presidential <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Decree
No. </span>1438 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">subsequently published
in </span>74 O.G. No. 41 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and cited by the
COA is that it gives the seeming i</span>mpression of having impliedly repealed
in part or amended the first version of the same decree published in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">74 O.G. No. 30.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the well-known rule which
disfavors implied repeals, the indisputable fact </span>that both versions of
said decree were singularly dated <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1978</st1:date> and were identified by the very same number would
necessarily reject such a construction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Had the issuing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">authority
intended such a repeal or </span>modification, an express statement to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">effect or </span>a different number for the
supposed repealing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">decree or </span>even
a subsequent date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
could have been resorted to with facility.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Furthermore, it is both
unknown and unclear as to why one version was published ahead of the other, and
not the other way around.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, </span>to
draw any conclusion from what appears as a mechanically adopted sequential
printing would necessarily be an unwarranted inference drawn from an obvious
uncertainty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When we pause and consider
the purpose and the intended beneficiaries of said pension scheme, we cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span>conscience
thereby subject their rights to such a tenuous thread of circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find it more logical, just and equitable, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">under </span>the circumstances, to hold that
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">monthly </span>pension for retired
judges and justices <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">starting </span>on
the sixth year of their retirement should include the highest monthly aggregate
of transportation, living and representation allowances the retiree was
receiving on the date of his retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is definitely more in keeping with and gives substance to the
elementary rule of statutory construction that, being remedial in character,
retirement laws should be liberally construed and administered in favor of the
persons intended to be benefited and all doubts as to the intent of the law
should be resolved in favor of the retiree to achieve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">its </span>humanitarian purposes (Bautista vs. Auditor General, etc.,
et al., 104 Phil. 428 [1958]; Ortiz vs. Commission on Elections, et al., 162
SCRA 812 [1988]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Retirement laws are
intended to entice competent men and women to enter the government service and
to permit them to retire <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> with relative
security, not only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>those who
have retained their vigor but, more so, for those who have been incapacitated
by illness or accident (See <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos vs. Auditor
General, et al., 79 Phil. 176 [1947]).</p>

<p class="BODY">We are, therefore, firmly convinced and so rule that the present
computation heretofore adopted by the GSIS and followed for around twelve (12)
years now, without any objection or reprobation by the then lawmaking authority
and any other functionary or entity, is correct and consonant with the avowed
policy of the law on retirement, especially when it is considered that a
pension is a form of deferred compensation for services performed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Government Service Insurance System is
hereby directed to continue implementing Republic Act No. 910, as amended by
Presidential Decree No. 1438, in the same manner and on the same bases of
computation as it has done since 1978, so that oh the sixth year of retirement
the monthly pension to be paid to the retiree shall consist of the highest
salary, the highest longevity pay, and the highest representation and
transportation allowances (RATA) the retiree was receiving on the date of
retirement.</p>
