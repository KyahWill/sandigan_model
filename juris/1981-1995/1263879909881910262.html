the Court of Appeals made the following disquisitions:</p>

</span>The last day of appealing (sic) depends on the day the parties received
their copies of the decision, the last to receive its copy being the last day
of appealing (sic), irrespective of whether the last party to receive its copy
of the decision is the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>Assuming therefore, that the period of appeal against the decision
of respondent Court ended on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">August 3,
 1987</st1:date>, the notice of appeal of petitioner as well as the motion for
execution of private respondent were seasonably filed on time and consequently

<blockquote>Did the respondent Court act correctly in issuing the challenged
order of <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1987</st1:date>
which granted execution by reconsidering its prior order of <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1987</st1:date>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>Most of the cases cited in its order of <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1987</st1:date> are not applicable to the case at

position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The case of <span class="SpellE">Manakil</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>, 42 Phil. 81, August 29, 1921, involved a motion
for reconsideration without the time or place of hearing, which was attempted
to be cured by setting the date of the hearing after the decision had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, the defective motion for reconsideration was cured on the
same day it was filed and before the decision had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case

</span>In the case of In Re <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>, cited in the <span class="SpellE">Azarias</span> case, the motion for reconsideration did not

Co., vs. <span class="SpellE">Batu</span> Construction, 14 SCRA 435, 1965, also
cited in the <span class="SpellE">Azarias</span> case, the motion for
reconsideration did not have any time or date of hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <span class="SpellE">Inesin</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>, 107 Phil. 213, Feb. 29,
1960, the motion for reconsideration did not contain the time and date of
hearing because counsel of <span class="SpellE">movant</span> did not know when
the Presiding Judge of <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
would hear cases in that town, since the Judge goes to <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>
only once a year, and so the court in said case held that the motion for
reconsideration suspended the period of appeal.</blockquote>

101 Phil. 727, <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1957</st1:date>,
the motion to dismiss did not bear the time and date of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the court itself set the motion for
hearing for the reasons (sic) that the adverse party was properly notified of
the existence of the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Supreme Court ruled therein:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'What the law prohibits is not the absence of previous notice, but
the absolute absence thereof and lack of opportunity to be heard.' (Citing <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> vs. Tan, 93 Phil. 167, and Duran vs. <span class="SpellE">Penolio</span>, 93 Phil. 782).</p>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, the deficiency or omission was corrected on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1987</st1:date>, before the judgment
became final and fourteen (14) days before the hearing set for <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, private respondents were duly heard on

a motion for reconsideration of the said order of <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">As shown above, private respondent received a copy of the <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="6">26 June 1987</st1:date> decision of the trial
court in Civil Case No. 23282 on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="7">7 July

Reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the said
motion did not contain a notice of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">3 August 1987</st1:date>,
herein petitioner filed a motion for the execution of judgment alleging therein
that the decision had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
since the motion for reconsideration, being merely a worthless piece of paper
for its failure to comply with the requirement of notice, did not stop the
running of the period to appeal from the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears however, that on 7 August 1987,
the trial court received a copy of a so-called Manifestation and Motion signed
by counsel for private respondent wherein there was incorporated a notice
addressed to the Clerk of Court informing the latter that said counsel will
submit the motion [for reconsideration] for the consideration and resolution of
the Court on 6 August 1987 at 8:30 A.M..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This manifestation and motion was allegedly sent by ordinary mail in the
afternoon of <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">22 July 1987</st1:date>;
however, the affidavit<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
of the messenger who purportedly mailed it deliberately fails to mention the
name of the Post Office concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason he gave for the mailing was that it was already late in the afternoon
and he anticipated that the manifestation and motion can no longer be filed on
time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">unrippled</span> doctrine in this
jurisdiction is that a m<span style="">otion </span>that
does not contain a notice of hearing is but a mere scrap of paper; it presents
no question which merits the attention and consideration of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not even a motion for it does not
comply with the rules and hence, the clerk has no right to receive it.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">in

Accordingly, the absence of a notice of hearing is fatal and, in cases of
motions to reconsider a decision, the running of the period to appeal is not
tolled by their filing or <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Sembrano</u></span> <u>vs.</u>

We emphasized anew the above principle:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court has invariably held that a motion without notice of
hearing is a mere scrap of paper.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing pronouncements of the Court,
private respondent's motion for reconsideration filed on 22 July 1987 did not,
therefore, suspend or toll the running of the period <span style="">to </span>appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
private respondent argues, and respondent court erroneously concedes, that the
failure of notice was cured by the Manifestation and Motion which it filed by
ordinary mail in the afternoon of that date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This pleading is another useless piece of paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that petitioner was
furnished with a copy thereof; on the contrary, petitioner denied having
received one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That none at all was
furnished to petitioner is <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> confirmed by
the failure of the affidavit of the messenger of private respondent's counsel<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
to state the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Personal service
of a copy could have been easily done since the office of counsel for
petitioner is located at Juan Luna St., Manila, while that of counsel for
private respondent is located at <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Metro
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the so-called notice
incorporated in the Manifestation and Motion is <u>not</u> <u>the</u> <u>notice</u>
required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated above, it is
a notice to the Clerk of Court <u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>counsel</u> <u>for</u>
<u>the</u> <u>petitioner</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5
of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court expressly and unequivocally requires that the
notice "shall be <u>directed</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>parties</u> <u>concerned</u>."
It did not then cure the fatal defect of the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Magno</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <u>Ortiz</u>,
<u>supra.</u>, We did not even consider a notice of hearing subsequently issued
by the court as having cured the defect of lack of notice for:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in
the first place, the duty to give such notices devolves upon the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, not upon the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Fulton Insurance Co. vs. Manila Railroad Co., et al., <u>supra</u>.,
it was pointed out categorically that section 2 of Rule 37 repealed the
provision of section 146 of the old Code of Civil Procedure and the rulings
founded thereon, to the effect that the notice must be served by the court on
the adverse party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, even
granting that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> had authority to issue <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> the notice of
hearing, such notice nevertheless did not cure the defect of the motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while the motion
was filed on the thirtieth day from notice of the decision the notice of
hearing was only issued sixteen (16) days thereafter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there was no subsequent notice of hearing
that was issued by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
any was issued, it would have been, <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span>,
beyond the period to appeal since it is not denied that the trial court
received a copy of the manifestation only on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="8">7 August 1987</st1:date>, or on the sixteenth (16th) day after the
expiry date (<st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">22 July 1987</st1:date>)
of the period to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if We are
to stretch then the Court's liberality and spread it as thinly as possible by
conceding for the sake of argument that the so-called motion incorporated in
the Manifestation and Motion is substantial compliance with the required notice
under Section 5 of Rule 15 and Section 2 of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, and
even if We disregard for the moment the absence of proof of service thereof to
petitioner, still no relief is forthcoming to private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The copy of the manifestation and motion for
the trial court was sent by <u>ordinary</u> <u>mail</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No credible justification has been offered by
private respondent as to why it was not sent by registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of Rule 13 of the Rules of Court on
service by registered or ordinary mail requires service <u>by</u> <u>registered</u>
<u>mail</u> <u>where</u> <u>registry</u> <u>service</u> <u>exists</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, service by ordinary mail is
allowed only in instances where no registry service exists.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent fails to indicate that no registry service was available at
the Post Office where it was mailed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering nevertheless, that the office of counsel for private
respondent is in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila, We cannot be persuaded to admit that there is no Post Office
thereat which does not offer registry service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> is a very prosperous and
progressive municipality and is now the business and financial center of the
National Capital Region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can We
expect counsel for private respondent, who belongs to a big law firm, to be so
naive as to choose <span style="">a </span>Post Office
without such service for the mailing of a very important pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, even conceding some lapses in
the degree of diligence required of counsel, and admitting that it did send by
ordinary mail the manifestation and motion in the afternoon of the day it filed
the defective motion for reconsideration, still the former did not cure the
defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, to all legal intents and
purposes, the manifestation and motion must be deemed to <span style="">have </span>been filed on the day that it was
received by the court, i.e., on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="8">7
 August 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commenting on
Section 8 of Rule 13 of the Rules of Court on completeness of service, Moran
says:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If
by ordinary mail, since it is not easy to determine the exact date when the
notice is received by the addressee, the service is deemed <u>complete</u> <u>and</u>
<u>effective</u> upon the expiration of five (5) days after the date of mailing,
as that is the estimated period of time in which a letter sent by registered
mail reaches its destination anywhere in the Philippines, except in few places
requiring more time which cannot be fixed before-hand, and as to which the
court must provide, in each case, a special period upon the expiration of which
the service may be deemed complete and effective, <u>and</u> <u>except</u> <u>when</u>
<u>the</u> <u>actual</u> <u>date</u> <u>of</u> <u>receipt</u> <u>is</u> <u>shown</u>
<u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>otherwise</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
(underscoring supplied for emphasis).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having been filed clearly beyond the period to appeal, it did not
operate to cure the defect of the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be given a retroactive effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Manila</u> <u>Surety</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Fidelity</u>
<u>Co.,</u> <u>Inc.</u> <u>vs</u><u><span style="">.</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Batu</u></span>
<u>Construction</u> <u>&amp;</u><span style=""> </span><u>Co.,</u>
<u>et</u> <u>al.</u>, <u>supra.</u>, <span style="">We
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We are not impressed by the argument that the ‘supplement’
filed by appellant on May 30 should be deemed retroactive as of the date the
motion for reconsideration was filed and therefore cured the defect
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To so consider it would be to put
a premium on negligence and subject the finality of judgment to the
forgetfulness or whims of parties-litigants and their lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This of course would be intolerable in a
well-ordered judicial system."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the decision of the trial court became final on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">22 July 1987</st1:date> and it did not commit
any error when it issued the Order of <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="8">24
 August 1987</st1:date> granting the motion of herein petitioner for the
execution of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, respondent Court of Appeals chose to be
oblivious to the foregoing rules and <span class="SpellE">unrippled</span>
doctrine and to be extravagantly liberal to the private respondent not only by
accepting as true the incredible claim that the Manifestation and Motion was
sent by ordinary mail on 22 July 1987 but also by considering as valid and sufficient
the notice incorporated therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the findings of the respondent court, the mailing of the
Manifestation and Motion was not evidence of those "who immediately rise
to the occasion, admit [their] mistakes, and try to cure them quickly,"
but a crude attempt to cover-up a late discovery of neglect or omission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not at all improbable, as petitioner
contended, that the "discovery" was made by private respondent only
after petitioner filed a motion for execution on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">3 August 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, instead of evoking the sympathy of the Court, petitioner's counsel
should be reprimanded for employing a malicious strategy to avoid the
consequences of his fatal mistake.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another aspect of the challenged decision which must be
squarely addressed because the conclusions made are not supported by
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it makes an erroneous
pontification as to the date the period to appeal from a decision commences to
run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court states:</p>

<blockquote>"On the question of jurisdiction, <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1987</st1:date> may or may not be the last or 15th day of
the period of appealing in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last day of appealing (sic) depends on the day the parties received
their copies of the decision, the last to receive its copy being the last day
of appealing (sic), irrespective of whether the last party to receive its copy
of the decision is the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, if all the parties hereto received the copy of the decision on
the same day, <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1987</st1:date>,
as did petitioner [private respondent herein], the last day of perfecting an appeal
<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by anyone of the parties is on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Belgado</span> vs.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 147 SCRA 258; <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span> vs.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 142 SCRA 124; <span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>?Murcia, 136 SCRA 295).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These decisions interpreted the phrase 'last
day to appeal by any party' contained in Section 23, Interim Rules and
Guidelines."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, it is not true that both parties received a
copy of the decision of the trial court on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">22 July 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
its own findings of facts, the Court of Appeals categorically stated that
private respondents received a copy of the decision on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="7">7 July 1987</st1:date> and that <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">22 July 1987</st1:date> was the last day to file a notice of appeal,
had they wished to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
commencement of the period to appeal should not be reckoned, as seems to be
suggested by the Court of Appeals, from the <u><span style="">latest</span></u><span style=""> </span>date
any of the parties received a copy of the decision, but from the respective
dates each of the parties received a copy of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, each party has a different period
within which to appeal, unless, of course, all of them received their copies on
the same date and none filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 23 of the Interim Rules of Court and
the decisions referred to, contrary again to the perception of the respondent
Court of Appeals, do not interpret the phrase "last day to appeal by any
party,” but rather refer to the <u>perfection</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>appeal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a whale of a difference between <u>last</u>
<u>day</u> <u>to</u> <u>appeal</u> and <u>perfection</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>appeal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last day to appeal is the fifteenth day
from receipt by a party of a copy of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, that appeal is not considered
perfected until the expiration of the period to appeal by the other party in
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinction assumes
importance only in cases involving execution of judgment pending appeal.</p>
