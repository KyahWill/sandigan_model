the present case filed by herein petitioner (p. 144, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue to be determined in the instant case is whether or
not the respondent Commission on Elections has acted with grave abuse of
discretion in disqualifying petitioner <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> C.
Geronimo from running for the office of mayor of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and in refusing to give due course to his
certificate of candidacy for the said position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of disqualification of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>
C. Geronimo is based on Section 10, Article XII(C) of the 1973 Constitution,
declaring that:</p>

<blockquote>"No elective public officer may change his political party
affiliation during his term of office, and <u>no candidate for any elective
public office may change his political party affiliation within six months
immediately preceding or following an election</u>" (underscoring

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that KBL is not a political party, so that he
could not have affiliated with the KBL as a political party, and he could not
have changed party affiliation from the KBL to NP; consequently, he is not
guilty of violating the constitutional and statutory prohibitions on <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> and he should not be disqualified from running
for the office of mayor of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, in arguing that KBL is not a political party but a mere
political movement or an umbrella organization, relied on the case of <span class="SpellE">Laban</span> vs. COMELEC (82 SCRA 196 [1978]) where this Court
held that KBL is not a political party. However, political developments
subsequent to the LABAN case showed that KBL was transformed from a mere tem­porary
alliance into a more or less stable political organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears noting, as it is significant, that
in the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>,
majority of the assemblymen are identified and identify themselves with pride
as KBL members, sporting T-shirts, hats, pins <span class="SpellE">labelled</span>
KBL, while the few opposition die-hards iden­tify themselves as members of the
NP or <span class="SpellE">Pusyon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, until December, 1979, the
majority members kept referring to themselves as KBL members. Likewise, the KBL
members held caucuses and meetings, to discuss vital issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actuations of these organizers and
leading members established the <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> organization of the KBL
since April, 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the acts
performed by the KBL leaders, not the formality of registration as a party,
should determine the commencement of party existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In like manner, in cases involving illegal
associations, the nature and true character of an organization are oftentimes
determined by the speeches and activities of its leaders and members rather
than by its constitution and by-laws (People vs. Ramos, CA-G.R. No. 5318,
December 28, 1940, 40 O.G. 2305 <u>[</u>Sept. 13, 1941]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Section 80 of the 1965 Election Code and Section 22 of
the 1971 Election Code defined apolitical party as "an organized group of
persons pursuing the same political ideals in a government and includes its
branches, and divisions." The 1978 Election Code adopted the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> definition by providing in Section 199 that
"any other group of persons pursuing the same political ideals in
government may register with the Commission and be entitled to the same rights
and privileges." Evidently, the KBL is composed of persons committed to
the same poli­tical ideals and is therefore considered a political party under
the aforementioned definition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such,
it was later duly accredited as a political party separate from the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party pursuant to Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 53 which became effective on December 22, 1979,
providing in Section 1 thereof that "for the purpose of such accreditation
a poli­tical party shall include political groups, <span class="SpellE">aggrupa­tions</span>,
organizations or associations of persons pursuing the same political ideals in
government," and COMELEC Resolution No. 1406 promulgated also on December
22, 1979, providing for the rules on the accreditation of political
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this Court has likewise
declared:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That KBL had always been
a political party or <span class="SpellE">aggrupation</span> can, therefore, no
longer be open to question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were KBL not
such a political party, block voting as was declared valid in the case of
Peralta vs. COMELEC could not have been availed of by it, as it unquestionably
did, in the 1978 <span class="GramE">elections.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For block voting is voting
for a political party" (Santos vs. COMELEC, L-52390, March 31, 1981).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Gabatan</span> vs. COMELEC (L-52381, January 26, 1980) and <span class="SpellE">Evasco</span> vs. COMELEC (L-52401, Resolution of January 28,
1980), this Court affirmed the disqualification of the candidates for the local
elective positions of <span class="SpellE">Pagsanjan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liliw</span>, both in Laguna, on the ground that they changed
party affiliation from the KBL to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party within six months immediately preceding the January 30, 1980 local
elections, and in effect recognizing the existence of the KBL as a political
party since April, 1978. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Therefore, the
status of KBL as a political party is now unquestionably a political reality.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question as to petitioner's affiliation with the KBL
as a political party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is clear
from the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> undisputed <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1979</st1:date> letters of the petitioner to
the chairman of the KBL <span class="SpellE">Baras</span> Chapter, that indeed he
was affiliated with the KBL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
confirmed by his statement in one of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
letters that "now loyal party members of the KBL party" he and his
men are seeking nomination as candidates for mayor, vice-mayor and members of
the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to run "under
the <span class="SpellE">Kilusang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipunan</span> Party (KBL)." This is an express recognition
of KBL as a political party and an admission of petitioner's affiliation with
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even went further by requesting
that his list be submitted "for <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> and
approval of the Pro­vincial Chapter of our party, the KILUSANG BAGONG LIPUNAN
PARTY (KBL)." In another letter, petitioner appealed to the local KBL
Chapter to hold in abeyance the proclamation of candidates for the elective
local positions "if the KBL local chapter has already formed and selected
the final line-up for the elective local positions, until finally decided by
Arbitration Committee," thus manifesting his fervent desire to be the
official candidate for mayor of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span> under the
banner of the KBL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, those <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> letters were profuse with references to KBL as
"our party." This persistent open declaration by petitioner of KBL as
"our party" can only suggest his affiliation with the KBL.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be pointed out also that the petitioner made a
categorical admission in his own petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
that he "was a member of the KBL," but offered the lame excuse that
"he never thought of it as a political party" (p. 5, Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>
and <i>Mandamus</i>, p. 5, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
personal belief cannot prevail over the clear manifestations of his adherence
to the KBL as a political party as established by his three aforementioned
letters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, during the hearing
of the case on January 15, 1980 before the COMELEC, petitioner, through
counsel, admitted being a member of the KBL before he filed his certificate of
candidacy (pp. 53, 109, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could
hardly be argued then that peti­tioner was not affiliated with the KBL as a
political party.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being a clear showing of petitioner's affiliation with the
KBL as a political party on December 31, 1979 as fully established by his three
<span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> letters and his admissions by himself or
through his counsel in his pleadings and at the hearing before the COMELEC, and
having subsequently affiliated with the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party as shown by his certificate of candidacy for municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>, subscribed and sworn to on January 4, 1980 and indis­putably
filed on the same date, within six months immediately preceding the January 30,
1980 local elections, his political <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> is
undeniable, thus warranting his disqualification as a candidate for the office
of mayor of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> is
made more despicable by the fact that petitioner filed on January 4, 1980 his
certificate of candidacy as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party
mayoralty candidate only after his request to be the official KBL mayoralty
candidate was denied on January 3, 1980 by the local KBL chapter because it had
already chosen the official candidates of the KBL for the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If his change of political color were due to honest disagreement
on principles with KBL leaders, his act would have the aura of noble
heroism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But his <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>
is sheer opportunism because his change of party loyalty was simply due to the
fact that he was not chosen the official candidate of the KBL.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE cannot likewise subscribe to the argument of the petitioner
that the prohibition in Section 10, Article XII(C) of the 1973 Constitution
against changing party affiliation should not apply to the January 30, 1980
local elections because the holding of the elections was declared barely a
month before the election date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For We
have already held that "the constitutional pro­vision against 'political <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>' already in force upon the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the New Constitution more than seven years ago, is clearly intended to apply
to all elections held under its regime, regardless of whether the holding of
said elections is declared less than the 6-month period mentioned in the
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stance taken by
petitioner that it should not apply in the last election the holding of which
was announced only a month <span class="GramE">before,</span> is clearly not
tenable, even only under the well-known legal maxim that where the law does not
distinguish, We should not distinguish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No right constitutionally protected under the due process clause is
involved for petitioner to complain against lack of sufficient notice because
of the less than six (6) months intervening between the declaration of the
holding of an election and the day of election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution speaks so unequivocally with its innovative and
mandatory provision, obedience thereof must be imposed" (<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. COMELEC, <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner furthermore assails P.D. No. 1661 as <u>ex</u> <u>post</u>
<u>facto</u> law if applied to him; hence, uncon­stitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prohibition of <u>ex</u> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u>
law has been unquestionably known as applicable only to laws or statutes which are
penal in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE have already ruled
in the Santos case, <u>supra</u>, that the aforesaid P.D. No. 1661 cannot
"be banned under the <u>ex</u> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u> law clause of the
Constitution, for it merely provides for a certain disqualification of a
candidate aspiring to be chosen to an elective office which, being a mere
privilege, is a fit subject for reasonable statutory regulation, clearly not
penal in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As
defined, <u>ex</u> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u> law is limited in its scope only to
matters criminal in nature."</span> Besides, P.D. No. 1661 which took
effect on <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1980</st1:date>,
is only an implementation of Section 10, Article XII(C) of the 1973
Constitution and the same decree was likewise held in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> case as having a prospective
application contrary to the claim of the petitioner that it is retroactive in
application. Petitioner ought to have been forewarned as early as 1973, that
there was already a constitutional prohibi­tion against <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>
and having violated the same, he should now bear the consequence of his
actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner should also be reminded that in exercising his
political rights, he should at all <span class="GramE">times</span> act in good
faith, especially because he is a retired lieutenant colonel of the Philippine
Air Force and a businessman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 19
of the New Civil Code expressly mandates that "<u>every person must, in
the exercise of his rights</u> and in the performance of his duties, act with
justice, give everyone his due, and <u>observe honesty and good faith</u>"
(underscoring supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, petitioner acted in gross and evident bad faith in changing his political
party affiliation from the KBL of which he was a party member, to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party, immediately after the KBL <span class="SpellE">Baras</span> Chapter denied his request to be the official KBL
candidate for municipal mayor, for the reason that it had already chosen the
complete line-up of the KBL official candidates pursuant to its party
rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such opportunistic and therefore
contemptible attitude of the petitioner should not be tolerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Section 10, Article XII(C) of the 1973
Constitution was adopted primarily to stop the "virus of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>" and political opportunism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, it would defeat or render
meaningless the very purpose for which the aforesaid novel constitutional
provision was adopted.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE find therefore that there was no grave abuse of discretion
committed by the respondent COMELEC in issuing the challenged resolution disqualifying
petitioner Geronimo from running as NP candidate for the position of mayor of <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and refusing to give
due course to his certificate of candidacy by reason of violation of the
afore-quoted constitutional and statutory provisions expressly prohibiting <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>, since there was substantial evidence in
support of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the absence
of patent and grave abuse of discretion, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot set
aside the COMELEC resolution complained of (<span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span>
vs. Commission on Elections, 88 SCRA 251 [1979<span style="font-size: 11pt;">]</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it must be noted that there is merit in private
respondent's contention that the instant case be dismissed for being premature
as there was a motion for reconsideration of the questioned resolution No. 8305
filed by petitioner with respondent COMELEC which was still pending at the time
of the filing of the instant petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in view of the nature of this case requiring as it does a
speedy and prompt disposition of the issues involved in order to determine the
party legally entitled to the position of <span class="GramE">mayor,</span> We
opted to decide once and for all the issues involved herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> THE PETITION IS HEREBY DISMISSED AND THE
RESTRAINING ORDER OF <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="1">JANUARY 28, 1980</st1:date>
