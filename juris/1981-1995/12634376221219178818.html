accuses JOSE VIVAR Y PAYABYAB of the crime of VIOLATION OF SEC. 15, ARTICLE
III, R.A. No. 6425, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as
amended, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That on or about the 7th day of April 1992, in the Municipality of
Dasmarinas, Province of Cavite, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being authorized by law, did,
then and there, wilfully and unlawfully, administer, deliver, give away to
another and sell to one PO3 Nicanor Diaz P100.00 worth of Methamphetamine
Hydrochloride commonly known as "<u>shabu</u>," a regulated drug
which is prohibited by law, in violation of the provisions of R.A. No. 6425,
thereby causing damage and prejudice to the public interest.</blockquote>

dated 11 February 1993 finding Vivar guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
offense charged, and sentencing him to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of
P20,000.00 and the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the lone assignment of error attributed the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> was its finding that the accused was guilty beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant facts are summarized by the trial court's Decision:</p>

<blockquote>"Prior to April 7, 1992, the police authorities of Dasmarinas
received reliable information from their asset that someone was selling illegal
drugs at Sta. Cristina, Dasmarinas, Cavite.  Reacting to this information, the Chief of Police of said town caused
the place of the accused to be under surveillance.  It was observed that many people frequented the place of the
accused which the police authorities believed to be activities related to the
buying and selling of <u>shabu</u> or methamphetamine hydrochloride.  Thus, Chief Notario formed a team consisting
of Police Officers Nicanor Diaz, Jerry Costa and Enrico Set for them to conduct
a buy-bust operation furnishing them a P100.00 - peso bill with Serial No. [XD]
720996 (Exhibit 'F').  The designated
poseur buyer was Nicanor Diaz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As planned, the team proceeded to the place of the accused on April
7, 1992 at about 5:00 in the afternoon at Barangay Sta. Cristina, Dasmarinas,
Cavite.  Once thereat, Nicanor Diaz
approached the accused who was out of the house but within his yard and made
known his intention to buy <u>shabu</u>.  The two team members placed themselves at strategic points from where
they could observe Nicanor Diaz and the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nicanor Diaz handed to, and the accused accepted the, P100.00-peso
bill.  After receipt of the money, the
accused entered the house and after a short while came back and handed to Diaz
the <u>shabu</u>.  At this point, Diaz
gave the pre-arranged signal by touching or scratching his head.  Whereupon, the other team members came
rushing to the aid of Diaz in subduing the accused who was resisting arrest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Diaz retrieved the P100.00-peso bill from the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused was then brought to the police station where he,
together with the <u>shabu</u>, was, turned over to the police
investigator.  The <u>shabu</u> was sent
to the NBI Forensic Chemistry Section for laboratory examination which proved
that the specimen sent was indeed <u>shabu</u> (Exhibit <span style="">'B')."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These facts were testified to by PO3 Nicanor Diaz and P03 Enrico
Set, members of the Philippine National Police ("PNP") detailed at
Dasmarinas, Cavite and more significantly, members of the PNP team that
conducted the buy-bust operation.  The
other pieces of evidence marked and offered by the prosecution during trial are
(a) Exhibit "A," a Letter-request for examination of the specimen
("white crystalline substance wrapped in an aluminum foil" weighing
0.0723 gram before the forensic examination) obtained during the buy-bust

(b) Exhibit "B," Certification by the NBI Forensic Chemistry Section

<p class="BODY">The defense set up by the accused consisted of denial.  As summed up by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  According to
the defense of the accused, at about 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. of that date [7 April
1992], the trio of Nicanor Diaz, Jerry Costa and Enrico Set came to his place
while he was in his yard with his sister and niece.  Without doing anything, the police, after a civilian asset
[informer] threw a P100.00 peso bill towards him, immediately arrested him
despite his protestations.  He denied
selling <u>shabu</u> to Nicanor Diaz."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Except for his testimony, no other
evidence, documentary or testimonial, was offered by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is unable to find merit in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the denial by the accused, much like alibi, is an
inherently weak defense and cannot prevail over the positive identification of
Vivar as the doer of the crime and vendor of <u>shabu</u>;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
all the more so where, as here, no ill-motive can be attributed the accused's
captors and accusers.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> In
the absence of proof of an evil motive (e.g., extortion, personal vengeance),
the presumption is that the police officers' motive in carrying out the
buy-bust operations was simply to perform their official duty which included the
enforcement of our laws relating to dangerous drugs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the propositions and arguments of the appeal, i.e., (a)
the lack of a formal complaint against Vivar prior to subjecting him to
surveillance; (b) the lack of a mission order; and (c) the alleged
impossibility of identification by virtue of the proximity of the surveillance
team to the door step of the accused where the illegal transaction was
consummated; (d) the alleged lack of conclusive evidence to show that the
accused was peddling <u><span style="">shabu</span></u><span style="">; </span>and (e) the supposed inconsistencies
in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are insufficient to overcome
the positive and straightforward testimonies of the arresting officers that
accused Jose "Bubot" Vivar had sold, during a buy-bust operation, <u><span style="">shabu</span></u><span style=""> </span>to PO3 Nicanor Diaz.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the lack of a formal complaint against Vivar and of
a police mission order, the Court has held that it will not pretend to
establish on <u>a</u> <u>priori</u> basis what detailed acts or measures police
authorities might undertake and carry out in entrapment operations<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
so long, of course, as such measures do not constitute violations of the
constitutional and statutory rights of the accused.  We are not aware of any constitutional or statutory provision
which requires a prior formal complaint against a suspect before an entrapment
operation may be mounted against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged testimonial inconsistencies, the issue is
ultimately one of the credibility of witnesses.  The Court has countless times reiterated the rule that the
findings of the trial court are accorded great weight and respect as trial
judges are undeniably in the best position to weigh the declarations of
witnesses in light of their opportunity to observe physically the witnesses'
conduct and attitude during trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses do not necessarily
damage their credibility provided such inconsistencies relate to minor details
and are reasonably explainable in the specific circumstances of a case.  Inconsequential variances are commonly
considered as badges of truth.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant's contention that the presumption of
regularity in the performance of official duties by police officers must yield
to the constitutional presumption of innocence indicates a basic confusion in
the mind of appellant or his counsel.  The
constitutional presumption of innocence is, after all, a presumption merely
which is precisely overcome by affirmative proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The presumption of regularity of performance
of official duty cannot, by itself, constitute proof of guilt, beyond
reasonable doubt.  We believe that, in
the present case and contrary to the submission of the appellant, the accused's
guilt was established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn, finally, to determination of the penalty properly
imposable upon appellant Vivar.  Under
Sections 15 and 20 of R.A. No. 6425, as last amended by R.A. No. 7659, as
construed and applied with retroactive effect in the very recent Decision of
this Court in <u>People v. Martin Simon</u> (G.R. No. 93028, 29 July 1994), and
given the circumstances that (a) the "<u>shabu</u>" sold by appellant
Vivar amounted only to one (1) aluminum foil with a weight of 0.0723 gram and
that (b) no aggravating or mitigating circumstance was found in the instant
case, the penalty properly imposable upon appellant Vivar is <u>prision
correccional</u> in its medium period.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, again in accordance with the
majority ruling of this Court in the <u>Martin Simon</u> case, appellant Jose
Vivar is properly sentenced to imprisonment for a term ranging from, as a
minimum, six (6) months of <u>arresto</u> <u>mayor</u> to a maximum of two (2)
years and four (4) months of <u>prision correccional</u> in its medium period.</p>
