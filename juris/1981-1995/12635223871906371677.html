The Court affirms the questioned decision of the now defunct Court of 
Appeals which affirmed that of the Court of First Instance of Quezon 
Province, but directs that the seller, respondent Leodegaria Cabana who 
sold the property in question twice, first to her co-respondents Teofilo
 Legaspi and Iluminada Cabana and later to petitioner Abelardo Cruz (now
 deceased), should reimburse to petitioner's heirs the amounts of 
P2,352.50, which the late petitioner Abelardo Cruz paid to the 
Philippine National Bank to discharge the mortgage obligation of said 
respondent Leodegaria Cabana in favor of said bank, and of P3,397.50, 
representing the amount paid by said Abelardo Cruz to her as 
consideration of the sale with <em>pacto de retro</em> of the subject property.
<p>
This is a simple case of double sale of real property. Respondent 
appellate court in its decision of August 13, 1980 stated the background
 facts and resolved the issue in favor of defendants-appellees, first 
buyers-respondents herein, and against plaintiff-appellant Abelardo 
Cruz, petitioner herein (substituted by his heirs), as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Defendants' evidence shows that on October 21, 1968, defendant 
Leodegaria Cabana sold the land in question to defendants-spouses 
Teofilo Legaspi and Iluminada Cabaña (Exh. 1). The said 
defendants-spouses attempted to register the deed of sale but said 
registration was not accomplished because they could not present the 
owner's duplicate of title which was at that time in the possession of 
the PNB as mortgage. </p>
  <p> "Likewise, when plaintiff tried to register the deed of sale 
executed by Leodegaria Cabaña on September 3, 1970, said plaintiff was 
informed that the owner thereof had sold the land to defendants-spouses 
on October 21, 1968. Plaintiff was able to register the land in his name
 on February 9, 1971 (Exh. A). With the admission of both parties that 
the land in question was sold to two persons, the main issue to be 
resolved in this appeal is as to who of said vendees has a better title 
to said land. </p>
  <p> "There is no dispute that the land in question was sold with right
 of repurchase on June 1, 1965 to defendants-spouses Teofilo Legaspi and
 Iluminada Cabaña (Exh. 1). The said document 'Bilihang Muling Mabibili'
 stipulated that the land can be repurchased by the vendor within one 
year from December 31, 1966 (see par. 5, Exh. 1). Said land was not 
repurchased and in the meantime, however, said defendants-spouses took 
possession of the land. </p>
  <p> "Upon request of Leodegaria Cabaña, the title of the land was lent
 to her in order to mortgage the property to the Philippine National 
Bank. Said title was, forthwith, deposited with the PNB. On October 21, 
1968, defendant Leodegaria Cabaña sold the land by way of absolute sale 
to the defendants-spouses (Exh. 2). However, on Novem­ber 29, 1968 
defendant sold the same property to herein plaintiff and the latter was 
able to register it in his name. </p>
  <p> "The transaction in question is governed by Article 1544 of the 
Civil Code. True it is that the plaintiff was able to register the sale 
in his name but was he in good faith in doing so? </p>
  <p> "While the title was registered in plaintiff-appellant's name on 
February 9, 1971 (Exh. A), it appears that he knew of the sale of the 
land to defendants-spouses Legaspi as he was informed in the Office of 
the Register of Deeds of Quezon. It appears that the defendants-spouses 
registered their document of sale on May 13, 1965 under Primary En­try 
No. 210113 of the Register of Deeds (Exh. 2). </p>
  <p> "Under the foregoing circumstances, the right of ownership and 
title to the land must be resolved in favor of the defendants-spouses 
Legaspi on three counts. First, the plaintiff-appellant was not in good 
faith in registering the title in his name. Consistent is the 
jurisprudence in this jurisdiction that in order that the provi­sions of
 Article 1544 of the new Civil Code may be invoked, it is necessary that
 the conveyance must have been made by a party who has an existing right
 in the thing and the power to dispose of it (10 Manresa 170, 171). It 
cannot be set up by a second purchaser who comes into possession of the 
property that has already been acquired by the first purchaser in full 
dominion (Bautista vs. Sison, 39 Phil. 615), this notwithstanding that 
the second purchaser records his title in the public registry, if the 
regis­tration be done in bad faith, the philosophy underlying this rule 
being that the public records cannot be covered into instruments of 
fraud and oppression by one who secures an inscription therein in bad 
faith (Chupinghong vs. Borreros, 7 CA Rep. 699). </p>
  <p> "A purchaser who has knowledge of fact which would put him upon 
inquiry and investigation as to possible defects of the title of the 
vendor and fails to make such inquiry and investigation, cannot claim 
that he is a purchaser in good faith. Knowledge of a prior transfer of a
 registered property by a subsequent purchaser makes him a purchaser in 
bad faith and his knowledge of such transfer vitiates his title acquired
 by virtue of the latter instrument of conveyance which creates no right
 as against the first purchaser (Reylago vs. Jarabe, L-20046, March 27, 
1968, 22 SCRA 1247). </p>
  <p> "In the second place, the defendants-spouses registered the deed 
of absolute sale ahead of plaintiff-appellant. Said spouses were not 
only able to obtain the title because at that time, the owner's 
duplicate certificate was still with the Philippine National Bank. </p>
  <p> "In the third place, defendants-spouses have been in possession 
all along of the land in question. If immovable property is sold to 
different vendees, the ownership shall belong to the person acquiring it
 who in good faith first recorded it in the registry of property; and 
should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to the 
person who in good faith was first in the possession (Soriano, et al. 
vs. The Heirs of Domingo Magali, et al., L-15133, July 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 
489). Priority of possession stands good in favor of herein 
defendants-spouses (Evangelista vs. Abad, [CA] 36 O.G. 2913; Sanchez vs.
 Ramos, 40 Phil. 614; Quimson vs. Rosete, 87 Phil. 159)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Court finds that in this case of double sale of real property, 
respondent appellate court, on the basis of the undisputed facts, 
correctly applied the provisions of Article 1544 of the Civil Code that
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Art. 1544. If the same thing should have been sold to different 
vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who may have 
first taken possession thereof in good faith, if it should be movable 
property. </p>
  <p> "Should it be immovable property, the ownership shall belong to 
the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the 
Registry of Property. </p>
  <p> "Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to 
the person who in good faith was first in the possession; and, in the 
absence thereof, to the per­son who presents the oldest title, provided 
there is good faith."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is no question that respondents-spouses Teofilo Legaspi and 
Iluminada Cabana were the first buyers, first on June 1, 1965 under a 
sale with right of repurchase and later on October 21, 1968 under a deed
 of absolute sale and that they had taken possession of the land sold to
 them; that petitioner was the second buyer under a deed of sale dated 
November 29, 1968, which to all indications, contrary to the text, was a
 sale with right of repurchase for ninety (90) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  There is no question either that respondents Legaspi spouses were the 
first and the only ones to be in possession of the subject property.
</p><p>
Said respondents spouses were likewise the first to register the sale 
with right of repurchase in their favor on May 13, 1965 under Primary 
Entry No. 210113 of the Register of Deeds. They could not regis­ter the 
absolute deed of sale in their favor and obtain the corresponding 
transfer certificate of title because at that time the seller's 
duplicate certificate was still with the bank. But there is no question,
 and the lower courts so found conclusively as a matter of fact, that 
when petitioner Cruz succeeded in registering the later sale in his 
favor, he knew and he was informed of the prior sale in favor of 
respondents-spouses. Respondent appellate court correctly held that such
 "knowledge of a prior transfer of a registered property by a subsequent
 purchaser makes him a purchaser in bad faith and his knowledge of such 
transfer vitiates his title acquired by virtue of the latter instrument 
of conveyance which creates no right as against the first purchaser."
</p><p>
As the Court held in <em>Carbonell vs. Court of Appeals</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  "it is essential that the buyer of realty must act in good faith in 
registering his deed of sale to merit the protection of the second 
paragraph of [the above quoted] Article 1544." As the writer stressed in
 his concurring opinion therein, "(T)he governing principle here is <em>prius tempore, potior jure</em>
 (first in time, stronger in right). Knowledge gained by the first buyer
 of the second sale cannot defeat the first buyer's rights except only 
as provided by the Civil Code and that is where the second buyer first 
registers in <em>good faith</em> the second sale ahead of the first. 
Such knowledge of the first buyer does not bar her from availing of her 
rights under the law, among them, to register first her purchase as 
against the second buyer. But <em>in converso</em> knowledge gained by 
the second buyer of the first sale defeats his rights even if he is 
first to register the second sale, since such knowledge taints his prior
 registration with bad faith. This is the price exacted by Article 1544 
of the Civil Code for the second buyer being able to displace the first 
buyer: that before the second buyer can obtain priority over the first, 
he must show that he acted in good faith throughout (i.e. in ignorance 
of the <em>first </em>sale and of the first buyer's rights) - from the 
time of acquisition until the title is transferred to him by 
registration or failing registration, by delivery of possession. The 
second buyer must show continuing good faith and innocence or lack of 
knowledge of the first sale until his contract ripens into full 
ownership through prior registration as provided by law."
</p><p>
Petitioner's prayer for alternative relief for reimbursement of the 
amount of P2,352.50 paid by him to the bank to discharge the existing 
mortgage on the property and of the amount of P3,397.50 representing the
 price of the second sale are well taken insofar as the seller 
Leodegaria Cabana is concerned. These amounts have been received by the 
said seller Leodegaria Cabana on account of a void second sale and must 
be duly reimbursed by her to petitioner's heirs, but the Legaspi spouses
 cannot be held liable therefor since they had nothing to do with the 
said second sale nor did they receive any benefit therefrom. 
Petitioner's claim for reimbursement of the amount of P102.58 as real 
estate taxes paid on the property is not well taken because the 
respondents Legaspi spouses had been paying the real estate taxes on the
 same property since June 1, 1969.4
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the appealed judgment of respondent appellate court, 
upholding respondents-spouses Teofilo Legaspi and Iluminada Cabana as 
the true and rightful owners of the property in litigation and ordering 
the issuance of a new title with the cancellation as null and void of 
Title No. T-99140 obtained by petitioner Abelardo C. Cruz, is hereby 
affirmed <em>in toto</em>. In accordance with the partial grant of 
petitioner's prayer for alternative relief as stated in the preceding 
paragraph hereof, the Court hereby orders and sentences respondent 
Leodegaria Cabana to reimburse and pay to petitioner's heirs the total 
sum of P5,750.00.

</p><p>
<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Respondents Legaspi spouses cite in their brief "facts of record" which were not denied or disputed by petitioner, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "First. The price paid by Cruz was uncon­scionably small. The 
complaint alleged that the land with an area of 27,882 square meters had
 an annual income of P3,000.00 (Record on Appeal p. 8) but the vendor, 
Leodegaria Cabana, was paid the paltry sum of only P5,000.00 (Record on 
Appeal, p. 25). </p>
  <p> "Second. Cruz bought the land without even making an inspection. 
The deed of sale was executed on November 25, 1968 but he visited the 
property only after February, 1971 or after a lapse of more than two 
years. (tsn Nov. 23, 1971, page 18). Surely, there must be something 
fishy when real estate with an income of P3,000.00 yearly can be had for
 only P5,000.00. By this fantastically low price, the buyer is already 
put on notice of a possible defect in seller's title and yet Cruz did 
not even visit the locality where he could have made appropriate 
inquiries. </p>
  <p> "Third. By petitioner's own admission (brief, p. 4), the agreement
 between them (Cruz and Leodegaria Cabaña) was SALE WITH RIGHT OF 
REPURCHASE within 90 days, however, the deed prepared by Atty. Bonus, 
counsel of Cruz in the trial court up to the Court of Appeals, was a 
deed of absolute sale. </p>
  <p>
    a clear premeditated circumvention of the agreement.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    x x x x
  </p>
  <p> "Fourth. The deed of sale in favor of Cruz was executed on 
November 29, 1968 (Record on Appeal, p. 11) but he declared the property
 for taxation only on April 20, 1971, or after the lapse of over two 
years. </p>
  <p> an indubitable showing that Cruz was uncertain of his title and 
was not duty bound to pay taxes thereon. And please note that he was 
constrained to pay the real estate taxes only because he found in 
Legaspi's answer to his complaint in the trial court that Legaspi had 
been paying the taxes on this property since June 1, 1969 (Record on 
Appeal, p. 9). Obviously Cruz must have realized that his claim of 
ownership would be adversely affected by not declaring this property in 
his name and not paying real estate taxes."
