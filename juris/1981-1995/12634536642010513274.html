Mauro, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Crispiniano</span>
Mauro guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of RAPE as defined and
penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic
Act 4111 and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION
PERPETUA, with all the accessory penalty of the law, and to indemnify Maria
Merced in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, but without subsidiary
penalty in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution's evidence is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">After taking her lunch on <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1972</st1:date>, the complainant Maria Merced took her siesta alone in the
middle of the floor of her hut at barrio <span class="SpellE">Tubo-Tubo</span>
Norte, Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her husband Santiago Merced at the time was
in the farm, while her two (2) sons <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> and
Domingo were in their landholding some forty to fifty meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was wearing a blouse and a blue pants,
zippered in front.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before going to
sleep, she placed above her head a bolo.</p>

<p class="BODY">About ten meters away from her house was the house of the accused
<span class="SpellE">Crispiniano</span> Mauro, separated by a two strand barbed
wire fence.</p>

<p class="BODY">She was suddenly awakened when her pants were <span class="SpellE">unzippered</span>
and ripped apart, and found appellant <span class="SpellE">Crispiniano</span>
Mauro, naked, on top of her and committing sexual intercourse with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried to free herself from his embrace
and shouted for her son, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> to come and help
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then felt the bolo over her
head and hacked appellant on the left side of the head above the ear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As Mauro tried to wrest away the bolo,
complainant was wounded on her right forefinger.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> heard his mother's shouts, left
the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to his younger brother Domingo and ran to
their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He saw his mother lying on
her back, fighting to extricate herself from Mauro who was on top of her,
naked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
got a piece of wood to hit Mauro but the latter jumped out of the house and ran
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
left to call for his father who was plowing in another field.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately, complainant, her husband and son <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
went to barrio Councilman Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Mana</span> to report the
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mana</span>
brought them to barrio Captain Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
where the incident was again recounted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They all went back to the scene of the crime, in the house of the
complainant and Maria narrated how she was raped in the middle of the floor and
how she wounded the accused on the head with a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Spots of blood were seen inside the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, they all went to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> and reported the matter to the
mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were told to proceed to the
municipal building to inform the police who entered the incident at the police
blotter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, complainant was examined by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Fuñe</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1972</st1:date>,
a complaint for rape was filed against herein appellant by Maria Merced.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense is:</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Mauro was in his field in <span class="SpellE">Tubo-Tubo</span>,
Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Zambales</span></span> that
afternoon of <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1972</st1:date>
when complainant arrived to borrow one (1) <span class="SpellE">ganta</span> of
rice for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mauro answered that he
would first ask his wife <span class="SpellE">Patrocinia</span> if they have rice
to spare.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">He </span>went home and told his wife to measure one (1) <span class="SpellE">ganta</span> of rice after which <span class="SpellE">Patrocinia</span>
shouted to the complainant:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Maria,
you come and get the rice." Maria answered:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Will <span class="SpellE">Manong</span>
kindly <span class="GramE">bring</span> the rice to our house."</p>

<p class="BODY">When Mauro arrived with the rice, he saw Maria wearing a khaki
shirt with short sleeves and <span class="GramE">a khaki short pants</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria was alone in the house and after
measuring the rice he brought, she began caressing him by placing her arms on
his shoulders and sitting on his lap.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She then said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Manong</span> will you kindly make it five (5) <span class="SpellE">gantas</span>,"
explaining that she will use the rice to feed 20 persons who will plant <span class="SpellE">palay</span> the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At that juncture, <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>,
the husband of complainant arrived and upon seeing the two, immediately <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> Mauro hitting him above the ear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant attempted to grab the bolo
from her husband and wounded herself in the process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mauro ran away, chased by <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
up to the barbed-wire fence which separated their respective yards.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mauro denied that he jumped through the window and emphasized
that Maria was alone in her house at the time, cooking, not sleeping when he
went up to deliver the one (1) <span class="SpellE">ganta</span> of rice.</p>

<p class="BODY">He denied the accusation of having raped Maria that afternoon and
alleged that <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> was a jealous
husband and because Maria was afraid of him, she filed this case. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Further, he denied that he ever tried to
settle the case amicably with the <span class="SpellE">Merceds</span>; that in
fact it was they who were demanding the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
from him, which, however, he refused saying that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"I have no fault why should I pay
P2,500.00."</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly stated by the trial court, the vital issue in
determining the innocence or guilt of appellant is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Which version - the prosecution or the
defense - is credible?</p>

<p class="BODY">Analyzing the evidence presented by both parties, we are inclined
to sustain the recommendation of the Solicitor General that the appealed
decision be affirmed for the reasons given by the trial court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">It</span> is well established in the record that this incident
occurred about three or three-thirty in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At that time it was too late for the day for Maria Merced to be cooking
lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And Mauro said she borrowed a <span class="SpellE">ganta</span> of rice for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was too early to be cooking for supper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it was the right time for a siesta.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So it was more probable that Maria was sleeping
at that moment than she was cooking.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If Maria was in need
of a <span class="SpellE">ganta</span> of rice that <span class="GramE">afternoon,</span>
she would not go first to the field where Mauro was working to borrow the
cereal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was more logical for her to
go to the house of Mauro which was just ten meters away and asked his wife, <span class="SpellE">Patrocinia</span>, to lend her a <span class="SpellE">ganta</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, custom has it that a housewife
would borrow items of the household from another housewife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Never from the husband.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And if one borrows a thing he would get it
himself from the lender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be
abusive to tell the lender to bring the item to the borrower.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the
defense shows that <span class="SpellE">Patrocinia</span> was sick that
afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because she was sick she
should be lying down and resting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet
Mauro told her to measure a <span class="SpellE">ganta</span> of rice, a chore he
could easily do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But was <span class="SpellE">Patrocinia</span> ill?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence of the prosecution discloses that she was not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was in a field one and one-half
kilometers from her house pulling <span class="SpellE">palay</span> seedlings
with Susana <span class="SpellE">Ebuengamana</span> and others from <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time> in the morning till <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court gives more credence to the claim of
<span class="SpellE">Ebuengamana</span> than to the protestation of the accused
and his wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ebuengamana</span>
has no interest in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused and <span class="SpellE">Patrocinia</span> have.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Maria Merced told the Court that she was raped by the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also said that she <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> and wounded him on that occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bolo was exhibited in court (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> wound of Mauro was treated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span>
who testified so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The blood from the
wound of Mauro was seen on the floor of the <st1:city><st1:place>Merced</st1:place></st1:city>'s
house by barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The wound suffered by Maria Merced when she
held on the weapon as the accused tried to snatch it from her was treated by
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Fuñe</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
testimony of Maria Merced was corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
Merced who responded to the cries for help of his mother and found the accused
on top of his mother, naked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
could be naked because he knew nobody was in his house and Maria Merced was
alone in hers and no one was within the vicinity to see him and so that he
could easily and at once perform the sexual intercourse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If it was true, as the
defense claims, that it was Santiago Merced who <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
Mauro, it was more logical for the latter to disarm the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria Merced would not try to wrest the
weapon from her husband who found her <span class="SpellE">inflagranti</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his
fury, Santiago Merced could even kill his wife if he really found her on the
laps of Mauro.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Maria Merced woke
<span class="GramE">up,</span> the accused had already consummated the rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had <span class="SpellE">unzippered</span>
and ripped the pants of Maria (Exhibit A) and introduced his organ into her
genitals and in fact he was having sexual intercourse with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is immaterial whether Dr. <span class="SpellE">Fuñe</span> did not find any spermatozoa in the smear that he took
from the vagina of Maria the day following the rape, as stressed by the
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could be that Mauro did not
ejaculate yet when Maria woke up and fought for her chastity, or the penetration
of his organ was not deep enough and was just at the threshold of the female
organ, and washed away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But any
penetration, whether deep or only at the threshold of the female organ, is
sufficient to constitute the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The lack of spermatozoa or gonococci is not incompatible with the
consummation of this crime.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accused did not
mention that he had any prior amorous relation with Maria Merced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not even intimate in his testimony
that before this incident Maria Merced had shown an interest in him, nor him in
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">presumed that Maria Merced is a virtuous woman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also a fact which the accused admitted
that he is an ex-convict who served a prison term for the crime of qualified
theft - a crime involving moral turpitude.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His moral fibers were weak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the circumstance, it is unbelievable that this woman would caress Mauro and sit
on his laps just to make him agree to a loan of some more rice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is more probable for Mauro to be overcome
by his beastly desire and raped the woman whom he found sleeping alone and
defenseless.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is very credible
that if it were Santiago Merced who hacked Mauro with the bolo the latter would
have died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court noted carefully the
physical structures of the two.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Santiago
Merced is bull-necked, stocky and with bulging muscles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mauro is thin and worn out.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court cannot
believe that it was Santiago Merced who tried to settle this case amicably and
asked P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> from Mauro for that purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being the offended party it was illogical for
him to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is logical is for
Mauro to make the offer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any way, this
fact has not surfaced categorically in the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim of both prosecution and the defense
on this point is inconclusive."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">It is a well-settled rule
that where the issue is one of the credibility of witnesses, appellate courts
will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court, considering that it
is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses them­selves
and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial, unless
it has plainly over­looked certain facts of substance and value that, if
considered, might affect the result of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>,
