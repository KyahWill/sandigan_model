appellant's claim is the fact that he immediately reported the force and
violence employed on him in two instances, namely: (1) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">at </span>the summary preliminary investigation conducted by the
Constabulary Judge Advocate's office on September <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Further, the advice given to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
