without one having been perfected (<span class="SpellE">Munez</span> v. CA, 152
SCRA 197 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judgments which had
long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> can no longer be
annulled or modified by the courts (United CMC Textile Workers Union v. Labor
Arbiter, 149 SCRA 424 [1987]) and the appellate court is deprived of
jurisdiction to alter the trial court's final judgments (<span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>
v. CA, 147 SCRA 565 [1987]; Republic v. Reyes, 155 SCRA 313 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of finality of judgments is grounded on fundamental
considerations of public policy and sound practice that at the risk of
occasional error the judgments of the courts must become final at some <span class="GramE">definite</span> date fixed by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reopening of a case which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
is disallowed (Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Arciaga</span>,
148 SCRA 433 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, when private respondent <span class="SpellE">Sadumiano</span>
filed his petition before the respondent Intermediate Appellate Court on <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1986</st1:date>, the decision
sought to be annulled for alleged lack of jurisdiction had already attained
finality and could not have been reopened by petitioners' non-compliance with
its resolution which admittedly they did not receive at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Certiorari</i> is no substitute for appeal
which had been lost (<span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tensuan</span>,
151 SCRA 410 [1987], <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 153 SCRA 104 [1987]; <span class="SpellE">Acain</span> v.

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the pleadings filed by counsel for private respondent <span class="SpellE">Sadumiano</span> were merely intended to frustrate and defeat the
execution of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment rendered is founded upon the evidence adduced by the
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the trial
court in said case proceeded to hear evidence <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>can only be attributed to private respondents' fault and no
other.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that <span class="GramE">a litigation</span> is
not a game of technicalities, this does not mean that the Rules of Court may be
ignored at will and at random to the prejudice of the orderly presentation and
assessment of the issues and their just resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Justice eschews anarchy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Auria</span>
