of 4 January 1991, which denied petitioner's motion for the reconsideration of
the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of 29 April 1991, We gave due course to the
petition and required the parties to submit their respective memoranda after
the private respondent filed its Comment on 16 April 1991 in compliance with
the Resolution of 27 February 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the challenged decision and the pleadings of the parties,
the following facts are not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 October 1986, petitioner, as assignee of certain rights of
one BOFTEX LIMITED under various contracts for ladies shorts, denim pants and
men's trousers which the latter entered into on various dates in 1985 with the
private respondent, filed a complaint against the latter with the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> (Branch 145), National Capital
Judicial Region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed
as Civil Case No. 15095.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Embodied in the
complaint is an application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supporting it is an
affidavit of its general manager which is attached to the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of preliminary attachment was issued <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="10">10 October 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No summons and a copy of the complaint were, however, served upon
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">11 August 1987</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an Order directing petitioner, as plaintiff, to take the
necessary steps towards the active prosecution of the case, otherwise it would
be dismissed for failure to prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="9">8 September 1987</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Request for Alias Summons, <span style="">and </span>on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="9">10 September
 1987</st1:date>, the Clerk of Court of the <span style="">trial </span>court issued an Alias Summons.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="12">7 December 1987</st1:date>,
<span style="">a </span>levy <span style="">on </span>attachment was made upon the machineries of private

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="2">16 February 1988</st1:date>,
private respondent filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to dissolve the
attachment<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
for failure of petitioner to prosecute its case for an unreasonable length of
time and that no copies of the summons and order of attachment were served upon
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="3">14 March 1988</st1:date>, petitioner filed its opposition thereto
alleging therein that it could not, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of its
diligent efforts, locate private respondent's principal office address.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="3">17 March 1988</st1:date>, the trial
court denied the motion to dismiss <span style="">and </span>ordered
private respondent to file its answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter filed <span style="">a </span>motion
for the reconsideration of the Order, but the trial court denied it in its
order of <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="5">20 May 1988</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="6">6 June 1988</st1:date>,
private respondent filed an Answer With <span style="">Counterclaim</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein<span style=""> </span>it prays that the
complaint be dismissed for lack of merit, the writ of attachment be discharged
and the <span style="">attached properties be returned
to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On its counterclaim,
private respondent <span style="">prays that
petitioner be </span>ordered to pay moral and exemplary damages as may be
determined by the court, attorney's fees in the sum of <span style="">P50,000.00 </span>and the litigation expenses and costs in an amount to
<span style="">be </span>proved at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court set the pre-trial of the case on <st1:date year="1988" day="25" month="7">25 July 1988</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, private respondent filed with this Court a petition to
annul the aforesaid Orders of 17 March and <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="5">20 May 1988</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court referred the petition to the respondent Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which the latter docketed as C.A.-G.R. SP No. 15647.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said petition, the private respondent
herein contends that the trial court:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) has not acquired jurisdiction over it as it has not been duly served
with summons, and (b) petitioner's failure to cause summons to be served upon
private respondent for an unreasonable length of time warrants the dismissal of
the complaint for failure to prosecute.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its challenged decision, the respondent Court sustains the
private respondent, ruling that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
Since private respondent was <span style="">not </span>validly
or properly served with summons, the court below did not acquire jurisdiction
over it.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the Sheriff and the petitioner herein could not locate the
principal office of private respondent is of no consequence, for whenever the
address of a defendant is unknown and cannot be ascertained by diligent
inquiry, service of summons may, by leave of court, be effected by publication
pursuant to Section 16 of Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court then acted with grave abuse
of discretion when he ordered the attachment <span style="">of </span>the property of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(b) Settled is the rule that where plaintiff
fails to prosecute his action for an unreasonable length of time, the action
may be dismissed upon motion of defendant or upon the court's o<span style="">w</span>n motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, from <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="10">9 October
 1986</st1:date>, when the complaint was filed, "up to the present or for
more than three (3) years," petitioner and the sheriff of the lower court
have not served the summons on private respondent and no effort has been
exerted by petitioner to have it served.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court should have dismissed the complaint for failure to
prosecute; courts should not brook undue delays in the ventilation and
determination of cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
their constant effort to assure that litigations are prosecuted and resolved
with dispatch.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In holding that an unreasonable length of time exists in this case, respondent
court makes reference to various cases where this Court sustained dismissals
for failure to prosecute for a period of more than one year,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
or <span style="">for </span>less than three (3)
months<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
or for even less than two (2) months.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of the foregoing, the respondent Court granted
the petition of private respondent and entered the judgment quoted at the
exordium of this decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner sought to reconsider the above decision in its motion
filed on 4 January 1990 alleging therein that (a) private respondent's
voluntary appearance via the filing of its answer and motion to dismiss has
rendered the petition, which is founded on lack of summons and failure to
prosecute, moot and academic, and (b) private respondent's reliance on
technicalities cannot defeat the ends of substantial justice whose issues have
been joined by the filing of the answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent court denied this motion in its resolution of 4 January
1991 on the grounds that the issues raised therein have been submitted to,
passed upon and resolved in the decision in question and that, even granting
the validity of the first issue raised, still the motion fails to touch upon
the other basis of the decision, namely, that the petitioner failed to
prosecute its case for an unreasonable length of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unsatisfied with the decision and resolution, petitioner filed
the instant petition on <st1:date year="1991" day="14" month="2">14 February
 1991</st1:date> and urges Us to set them aside because the respondent Court
erred in finding that (a) the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the
person of private respondent, and (b) that petitioner failed to prosecute its
case for an unreasonable length of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to the first, petitioner contends that the filing by private respondent
of an answer in June 1988 and a motion to dismiss on 16 <span style="">February </span>1988 constituted a voluntary appearance and rendered
moot and academic the issue of lack of service of summons, for, pursuant to
Section 23 of Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, voluntary appearance is equivalent
to service of summons.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, as was held in <span class="SpellE">Tenchavez</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
even if private respondent objected to the jurisdiction of the court over its
person, considering that it filed an answer with counterclaim, which makes it
also a plaintiff, it thereby invoked the jurisdiction of the court in the same
action and submitted to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further
claims that the failure to serve summons upon private respondent was largely
due to the latter's fraudulent act of concealing its whereabouts, "even up
to this day", and despite having been apprised of petitioner's difficulty
of locating private respondent's offices, the latter and its counsel refused to
disclose its address.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second ground, petitioner contends that the
failure to serve summons on private respondent is solely attributable to the
fact that <span style="">despite diligent efforts on </span>its
part and the sheriff, the principal office of respondent could not be
located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has exhausted means to
locate it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, after <span style="">the </span>trial court granted its
application for a writ of attachment, it posted, without unnecessary delay, the
bond and forthwith implemented the writ of attachment through the sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, as held in many cases,
dismissal of <span style="">actions on </span>purely
technical grounds should be frowned upon by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the risk of some delay, a court should not
dismiss a complaint where it appears that the plaintiff has a meritorious
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since in this case, private
respondent has in fact filed its answer, and the issues have been joined, it is
proper that the case be allowed to proceed to trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Comment, private respondent sustains the challenged
decision but does not meet squarely the issue of its voluntary appearance, or
waiver of service of summons by the filing of the motion to dismiss and the
answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully studied the pleadings in this case and upon due
deliberation thereon, We find no reversible error which could be attributed to
respondent Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assigned error is merely impressive on its face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reality, it is hollow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss the complaint and to
dissolve the writ of attachment filed by private respondent on 16 February 1987
was precisely based on failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time
because summons has not been served even up to that point in time and on the
nullity of the attachment for failure to serve summons on private respondent
and to furnish it with copies of the writ of attachment and the notice
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>claims that failure to serve the summons <span style="">is </span>sufficient to vacate or annul the
writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, this appearance of private respondent was not,
contrary to the claim <span style="">of </span>petitioner,
<span style="">a </span>general appearance, and did
not operate <span style="">as </span>waiver of service
of summons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's <span style="">recourse to or reliance on </span><u>Salmon</u>
<u>and</u><span style=""> </span><u>Pacific</u> <u>Commercial</u>
<u><span style="">Co.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs.</u> <u>T</u><u><span style="">an</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Cueco</u></span>,
<u>supra.</u>, <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Tenchavez</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>E</u><u><span style="">scaño</span></u></span><span style="">, <u>supra.</u>, </span><span style="">is </span>completely
misplaced -- although not for the disquisitions made by private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the former, there was a <u>general</u>
appearance made by <u><span style="">Salmon</span></u><span style=""> </span>by virtue of <u>the</u> <u>filing</u> <u>of</u>
<u><span style="">an</span></u><span style=""> <u>answer</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In the
latter, <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> did, in fact, file an answer with the
counterclaim and the matter of jurisdiction over the person because she is a
non-resident defendant <span style="">was </span>only
raised as a special defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
after that issue was unfavorably ruled upon by the trial court, it was not
properly ventilated either on appeal or by special remedy or even in her brief
as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, the filing of the Answer by private respondent does not
appear to have <span style="">been</span> <span style="">squarely raised in </span>the proceedings
before the respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 15647<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
does not <span style="">refer </span>to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner makes no direct and specific
allegation in its petition in the instant case that it had initially raised and
pursued with vigor this matter in any of the pleadings it filed before the
promulgation of the challenge decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter does not mention it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not having been properly and seasonably raised, the respondent Court
could not have considered the legal effects of the filing of the Answer in its
decision of <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="12">7 December 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as impliedly ruled by respondent
Court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1991" day="4" month="1">4 January
 1991</st1:date>, the filing of the Answer did not affect the issue of failure
to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the respondent Court in this
regard for to rule otherwise <span style="">is </span>to
reward petitioner for its inaction and to punish private respondent for
complying with the trial court's order of <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="5">20 May 1988</st1:date> which denied the motion to reconsider the
Order of <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="3">17 March 1988</st1:date> and
required it to file its Answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That its
answer was filed solely for that purpose is made manifest by its filing of a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> precisely to annul said Order and the previous
Order of <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="3">17 March 1988</st1:date>
denying the motion to dismiss and to dissolve the writ of attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A dismissal for failure to prosecute for <span style="">an </span>unreasonable length of time puts an
end to the case and it would be unjust and unfair to compel a defendant to
abort such a result by filing an answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion
when it ordered private respondent to file the Answer despite the fact that it
was not yet served with summons and a copy of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court then did not validly acquire jurisdiction over
the person of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the implementation of the writ of attachment against the property of private
respondent <span style="">is </span>null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that under
Section 1 of Rule 57 of the Rules of Court the property of the defendant may be
attached, as security for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be
recovered in the cases therein enumerated, upon application by the plaintiff at
the commencement of the action or at any time thereafter, <span style="">a </span>court which has not acquired jurisdiction
over the person of the defendant <span style="">cannot
</span>bind the defendant, whether in the main case or in the proceedings for
the ancillary remedy of attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the relatively recent case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Sievert</u></span> <u>vs.</u>
<u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Ap</u><u><span style="">p</span>eals,</u>
<u>e</u><u><span style="">t</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><u><span style="">l.</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">We
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Attachment is an ancillary remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not sought for its own sake but rather
to enable the attaching party to realize upon relief sought and expected to be
granted in the main or principal action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A court which has not acquired jurisdiction over the person of the
defendant, cannot bind that defendant whether in the main case or in any
ancillary proceeding such as attachment proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The service of a petition for preliminary
attachment without the prior or simultaneous service of summons and a copy of
the complaint in the main case - and that is what happened in this case - does
not of course confer jurisdiction upon the issuing court over the person of the
defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ordinarily, the prayer in a petition for a writ of preliminary
attachment is embodied or incorporated in the main complaint itself as one of
the forms of relief sought in such complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, valid service of summons and a copy of the complaint will in such
case vest jurisdiction in the court over the defendant both for purposes of the
main case and for purposes of the ancillary remedy of attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such case, notice of the main case is at
the same time notice of the auxiliary proceeding in attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, however, the petition for a writ of
preliminary attachment is embodied in a discrete pleading, such petition must
be served either simultaneously with service of summons and a copy of the main
complaint, or after jurisdiction over the defendant has already been acquired
by such service of summons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of
the separate attachment petition is not notice of the main action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Put a little differently, jurisdiction
whether <span class="SpellE"><u>ratione</u></span> <u>personae</u> or <span class="SpellE"><u>ratione</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>materiae</u></span> in
an attachment proceeding is ancillary to jurisdiction <span class="SpellE"><u>ratione</u></span>
<u>personae</u> or <span class="SpellE"><u>ratione</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>materiae</u></span>
in the main action against the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If a court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter or over the
person of the defendant in the principal action, it simply has no jurisdiction
to issue a writ of preliminary attachment against the defendant or his
property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second assigned error is equally without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not unmindful of the rule that the
dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of

and that as to what constitutes "unreasonable length of time", this
Court has ruled that it depends upon the circumstances of each particular case;
and that the sound discretion of the court in the determination of said
question will not be disturbed in the absence of patent abuse.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
We agree with the respondent court -- although not necessarily for the
authorities cited since a closer examination thereof reveal that they do not
involve similar factual background or causes of action as this case -- that it
was error for the trial court not to dismiss petitioner's complaint for failure
to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing on record supports the claim of petitioner that it had
exerted diligent efforts to serve the summons and a copy of the complaint on
private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that it can
offer to invite a sympathetic ear are the self-serving claim that it had
exerted such efforts to locate private respondent's principal office address
and an insinuation that private respondent and its counsel deliberately
concealed such address from petitioner and the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim and the reality are oceans
apart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is absolutely no showing at
all that an attempt was made to serve both the original summons with a copy of
the complaint and the alias summons, which petitioner asked to be issued not on
its own accord as indication of a sincere effort to bring the defendant within
the jurisdiction of the court, but as a reluctant reaction to the trial court's
order of 11 August 1987 directing petitioner to take the necessary steps toward
the active prosecution of the case, otherwise it would be dismissed for failure
to prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The standard practice in
trial courts, which is in conformity with Rule 14 of the Rules of <span style="">Court, i</span><span style="">s </span>for the Clerk of Court to issue at once the summons upon the
filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty
of a plaintiff or his counsel to see to it that the sheriff or a process server
immediately cause its service, together with a copy of the complaint, on the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, plaintiff is
invariably furnished with a copy of the return of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If no such return is furnished him, it is
incumbent upon plaintiff or his counsel to inquire from the Clerk of Court as
to the status of the summons not only to take appropriate action if it had not
been served, but to know when the period to answer expired if service was
properly made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case,
petitioner did not make any concrete appropriate step to have the alias summons
served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 13 of Rule 14 of
the Rules of Court, service of summons on a defendant corporation may be made
on the president, manager, secretary, cashier, agent or any of its
directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner should have
verified from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to the names of the
officers and directors of the private respondent and as to its principal office
address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not assert in the
petition that it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it could
have availed itself of the procedure provided for in Section 16 of the same
Rule on summons by publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot place the blame on private respondent or its counsel, for if indeed
petitioner were genuinely serious about knowing from either the principal
office address of private respondent, petitioner could have, if it could not
get it through an informal request, filed a motion for an order directing private
respondent and/or its counsel to <span style="">give </span>to
petitioner such principal office address.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not appear, however, that petitioner did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From its allegations, it seems clear that it
merely waited for private respondent or its counsel to volunteer the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, even after private respondent filed
its motion to dismiss precisely on the ground of failure to prosecute for an
unreasonable length of time because of the non-service of summons, petitioner
did nothing --<span style=""> </span>absolutely nothing
-- to remedy <span style="">the </span>situation.</p>
