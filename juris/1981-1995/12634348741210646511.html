				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the early morning of January 24, 1984, barangay Migcawayan of the municipality of Damulog, Bukidnon, was raided by around fifty (50) armed men. When the smoke cleared, seven (7) persons lay dead, four (4) persons were injured, houses were riddled by bullets, ten (10) carabaos, three (3) horses and an undetermined amount of personal belongings and valuables were taken away by the raiders. Accused-appellant Benhur Tahuyan was identified as one of the raiders. He was charged in court and consequently sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The trial court made the following findings of facts:<br><blockquote>"[I]t appears that at or around 5:30 o'clock in the morning of January 24, 1984, accused Benhur Tahuyan y Adon and around fifty others, some of whom were Muslims and some, natives, attacked barangay Migcawayan, of the municipality of Damulog, Bukidnon. The group was armed with assorted firearms, which fired at random (sic) the houses in the said barangay. When witness Gregorio Bagares was awakened by the several gun shots coming near his house, he immediately ran away and sought refuge in the nearby banana plantation which has a distance of approximately 40 fathoms located opposite his house. While hiding in the banana plantation he saw five (5) persons firing several shots directed towards his house. Of the five persons, only three went inside his house, while the two remained outside, one of whom was accused, Benhur Tahuyan y Adon; that this witness did not recognize or know the three persons who went inside his house, nor did he know or recognize the companion of Benhur Tahuyan. After the three persons came out of his house, they brought with them sacks presumably with their loot inside them, after which one of them set Bagares’ house on fire by lighting its roof and ran away. There were five other houses that were inhabited in the barangay, houses belonging to Ignacio Capanay, Carilo Martin, Quina Dalaygon, Rogelio Taghap and Hermie Galamiton that were fired by the band with their firearms. The attack further resulted in the alleged loss of the properties of the residents in the barangay and the death of seven inhabitants therein, namely Danny Ramos, Jocelyn Martin, Jerrylin Martin, Cerilo Martin, Josela Martin, Rosalina D. Capanay and Silvestre G. Judilla."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant was charged with Robbery in Band with Multiple Murder and Physical Injuries with the Use of Unlicensed Firearms in the Regional Trial Court, 10th Judicial Region, Branch 9, Malaybalay, Bukidnon, in Criminal Case No. 4011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>After trial, he was found guilty as charged and sentenced to a penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordered to pay P30,000.00 each to the heirs of the seven victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On appeal before this Court, accused-appellant pleads his innocence and claims that:<br><blockquote>"That accused is a duly elected Barangay Captain of Omonay, Damulog, Bukidnon, a place about thirty (30) kilometers away from Migcawayan, the place of the incident. (TSN Bacawag, pages 2 and 3, December 15, 1988 hearing).<br><br>"Accused-appellant denied the charge against him as they are all lies for from January 19, 1984 to February 4, 1984, he was in his house sick with flu. That on January 24, 1984, he cannot (sic) even get up. He was attended to by Project Manager Enrique Dagawasan of the Presidential Assistant on National Minorities. (TSN Bacawag, pages 3 and 4, December 15, 1988 hearing). That he has never gone to the place of the incident and came to know of the same and its distance only from fellow Barangay Captains whom he used to meet during their meetings. That he has not undergone Community Home Defense Force (CHDF for short) training for as Barangay Captain, they are automatically integrated into the force. (TSN Bacawag, pages 5, 6 and 7, December 15, 1988 hearing).<br><br>"He came to know government witness Bagares only during the trial when the latter testified. (TSN Bacawag, page 4, December 15, 1988 hearing). That Bagares is after his brother Prudencio Tahuyan, popularly known as Bing-as who was killed by the military and CHDF. (TSN Bacawag, page 5, December 15, 1988 hearing)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>Appellant's main defense is alibi. He testified that Enrique Dagawasan, his parent-in-law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and a Presidential Assistant on National Minorities (PANAMIN) as Project Officer, nursed him to health on the date when the attack on Migcawayan took place as he was allegedly sick.<br><br>The issue before this Court is the credibility of the witnesses -- prosecution eyewitness Bagares who testified that one of the raiders who stood guard outside his house was the accused-appellant or defense witness Eugenio Dagawasan who testified that he treated the accused-appellant for flu on the very day of the raid on Migcawayan.<br><br>We reiterate the well-settled rule that:<br><blockquote>"[T]he matter of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimony in the light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial and is thereby placed in a more competent position to discriminate between the true and the false. Appellate courts will not disturb the credence or lack of it, accorded by the trial court to the testimony of witnesses unless it be clearly shown that the latter court had overlooked or disregarded arbitrarily the facts and circumstances of significance in the case. x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>To support the judgment of conviction, the trial court relied mainly upon the testimony of Gregorio Bagares who positively identified accused-appellant as one of the raiders who stood guard outside his house with another unidentified companion while their three other companions entered his house to ransack the same. His testimony is as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="12%"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td width="88%"><div align="LEFT">"xxxxxxxxx</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">COURT:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> You said in your direct testimony that of the five persons three got inside your house and two were outside, now, was the accused among the three who went inside your house, or one of those outside your house?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> He was outside, Your Honor.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">What was he doing at the time you saw him?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> He was just watching or guarding outside.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> He did not do anything except to watch?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Yes, that was all he did.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Why do you say that Benhur Tahuyan was watching?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Because he was outside the house.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> And that was your basis in (sic) telling the court that he was watching because he was outside the house?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Yes, Your Honor.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> What was his position when he was according to you watching your house?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> He was just holding his rifle hi-fort (sic).</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Was he standing or sitting?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> He was standing.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Facing towards what direction?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> He was facing towards outside (sic).</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">So, his back was facing your house?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Yes, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> What about his companion, what was he doing?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">The same.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Was he also armed?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Yes, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Do you know what arm was he armed (sic) at the time?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Benhur was armed with M-79 and his companion was armed with a garrand rifle.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Where was that companion of Benhur Tahuyan facing at the time?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">He was also facing towards the outskirts (sic)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">"xxxxxxxxx.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"COURT:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Did you know their names already, (sic) these two people who were outside your house?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> I know one.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Who (sic) of the two?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Benhur Tahuyan.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> What about the other one?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> I don't know him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">"xxxxxxxxx.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">"ATTY.

It cannot prevail over a positive identification made by a prosecution witness. For such a defense to prosper, it is not enough to prove that accused was somewhere else when the crime was committed but that he must also demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Considering that accused-appellant has not shown that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime, Migcawayan, which is thirty-six (36) kilometers away from Omonay,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> when he was allegedly sick, and considering that his corroborating witness was his "parent-in-law,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the court <i>a quo</i> did not err in rejecting accused-appellant's alibi and its ruling that prosecution eyewitness Bagares’ positive identification of the accused-appellant as one of the persons who raided Migcawayan was worthy of credence.<br><br>Accused-appellant's other defense that prosecution eyewitness Bagares was really "after his brother, Prudencio Tahuyan," is unbelievable considering that accused-appellant himself stated that his brother Prudencio was killed by the military and CHDF on August 10, 1983<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> while the raid took place more than five (5) months later, or on January 24, 1984. Thus, Bagares had no motive to testify falsely -- if he had any in the first place -- and his positive identification of accused-appellant as one of the raiders should be given full credence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> as it was so given credence by the trial court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b> with the MODIFICATION that the accused-appellant has to pay each victim's heirs the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity.
