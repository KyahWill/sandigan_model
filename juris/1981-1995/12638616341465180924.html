				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Assailed in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> is the decision
dated September 30, 1988 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC),
affirming the decision dated August 21, 1987, of the Labor Arbiter ordering the
reinstatement with back wages of the private respondent on the ground that he
was not a project <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">employee </span>but a
member <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of the work </span>pool and that
be was illegally <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dismissed on </span>April
20, 1986.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent was employed by PNCC as an <span class="SpellE">oiler</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">from </span><st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">November
 4, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>until
he was terminated on <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1986</st1:date>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on the ground </span>of completion of
the project to which he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was assigned.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The private respondent,
in his complaint for illegal dismissal, alleged that he was discharged not for
cause, but because the newly designated supervisor, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, wanted to put in his own man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The point in issue is
whether or not the private respondent was a member of the work pool, therefore,
considered a regular employee (Art. 280, Labor Code), or a project employee,
whose employment was co-terminus with the projects to which he was assigned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After a careful
consideration of the petition and the comment filed by the Solicitor General
for the respondents, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the NLRC did not
abuse its discretion in affirming the Labor Arbiter's conclusion that the
private respondent was a member of the work pool and that he was illegally
dismissed from his job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i><u>"Members of a work pool</u> from which a construction
company draws its project employees, if considered employee of the construction
company while in the work pool, <u>are non-project employees or employees for
an indefinite period</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If they are
employed in a particular project, the completion of the project or any phase
thereof will not mean severance of employer-employee relationship."

continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the activity which he is employed and his
employment shall continue while such actually exists." (Art. 280, Labor
Code.)</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A project employee is one whose "employment has been fixed
for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which
has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the
work or services to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is
for the duration of the season." <span class="GramE">(Sec. 280, Labor Code;
Sandoval Shipping, Inc. vs. NLRC, 136 SCRA 674.)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In finding that <span class="SpellE">Porciuncula</span> was a
regular employee, the Labor Arbiter noted that it was the petitioner's practice
to re-hire him after the completion of every project and this re-hiring
continued throughout <span class="SpellE">Porciuncula's</span> 13 years of
employment in the company.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter also observed that the petitioner never reported
the completion of its projects and the termination of the employees (like <span class="SpellE">Porciuncula</span>) in its finished projects, to the nearest
Public Employment Office as required by Policy Instruction No. 20 of the
Secretary of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ochoco</u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> vs. </span>NLRC</u>, 120 SCRA 774, the
failure of the employer to report to the nearest employment office the
termination of the workers <span class="SpellE">everyti<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">me</span></span> it completed a project was considered by this Court as
proof that they were not project employees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We, </span>therefore,
find <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">no grave abuse </span>of
discretion in the Labor Arbiter's holding so, nor in the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
<span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is dismissed
for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
