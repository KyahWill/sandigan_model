This case is about the suspension by Governor Aguedo F. Agbayani of 
Victoriano M. Sevilleja as provincial engineer of Pangasinan.
<p>
On October 1, 1976, Governor Agbayani filed with the Provincial 
Complaints Committee a complaint against Sevilleja for alleged 
disobedience, grave misconduct, dishonesty and grave insubordination. 
Three days later, the governor suspended Sevilleja for a period of 
ninety days.
</p><p>
On October 6, 1976, Sevilleja filed an action for <em>certiorari</em>, prohibition and <em>mandamus </em>wherein
 he assailed the order of suspension. The petition was dismissed in this
 Court's resolution of May 17, 1977 in L-44735, Sevilleja vs. Agbayani.
</p><p>
On November 17, 1976, Sevilleja filed in the Court of First Instance of 
Pangasinan (Civil Case No. 15284) a petition for prohibition against the
 Provincial Complaints Committee and its chairman, Manuel F. Manuel, to 
restrain the administrative investigation. Governor Agbayani was later 
included as respondent.
</p><p>
On May 17, 1977, Judge Romeo D. Magat issued a preliminary mandatory 
injunction ordering the reinstatement of Sevilleja. That order was 
assailed by Governor Agbayani in the herein <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition case which he and Manuel's committee filed on May 24, 1977.
</p><p>
After the submission of comments, this Court in its resolution of November 27, 1978 <em>dismissed the petition</em>
 for lack of interest of Agbayani and Manuel and lifted its restraining 
order enjoining the enforcement of Judge Magat's order of May 17, 1977 
for Sevilleja's reinstatement.
</p><p>
However, upon motion for reconsideration by Agbayani and Manuel, said 
resolution was reconsidered and the case was set for oral argument. The 
parties were granted sixty days to submit a compromise agreement. No 
compromise was reached.
</p><p>
On August 26, 1981, the Sandiganbayan rendered a decision acquitting on 
the ground of reasonable doubt Sevilleja and one Leonardo Abule of 
attempted estafa. Sevilleja contends that said acquittal rendered this 
case and the administrative case moot and academic because the charge in
 the Sandiganbayan was predicated on the same averments alleged in the 
administrative case which involves Sevilleja's alleged purchase of 24 
bailey panels of inferior quality for use in the renovation of the 
Braganza bridge.
</p><p>
After a conscientious study of the record, we hold that Governor Agbayani and Manuel have no cause of action for <em>certiorari</em>
 and prohibition. Judge Magat acted within his jurisdiction and did not 
act with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the restraining order of 
May 17, 1977.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is dismissed. The restraining order of May 27, 1977 is lifted. Costs against the petitioners.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Escolin,</em> and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Gutierrez, Jr., J.</em>, was designated to sit in the Second Division.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Guerrero</em>, and <em>Abad Santos, JJ.</em>, no part.
