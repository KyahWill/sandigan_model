				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition raises the sole issue of whether or not the owner
of a private vehicle which figured <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>an
accident can be held liable under Article 2180 of the Civil Code when the said
vehicle was neither driven by an employee of the owner nor taken with the
consent of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are summarized in the contested decision, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs, consisting of
the testimonies of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, Jr., <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span>, Jr. and Norberto <span class="SpellE">Bernarte</span> it appears that on July 28, 1971 plaintiffs
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Catuar</span> were aboard a jeep with plate number
77-99-F-1-Manila, 1971, owned by plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span> was driving the said jeep on <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>
Avenue, San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; that plaintiff's jeep, at
the time, was running moderately at 20 to 35 kilometers per hour - and while
approaching Roosevelt Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span> slowed down; that suddenly, another jeep with plate
number 99-97-F-J, Manila 1971 driven by defendant Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>
hit and bumped plaintiff's jeep on the portion near the left rear wheel, and as
a result of the impact plaintiff's jeep fell on its right and skidded by about
30 yards; that as a result plaintiff's jeep was damaged, particularly the
windshield, the differential, the part near the left rear wheel and the top
cover of the jeep; that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span> was thrown to the middle of the road; his wrist was
broken and he sustained contusions on the head; that likewise plaintiff Antonio
<span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, Sr. was trapped inside the fallen jeep,
and one of his legs was fractured.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Evidence also shows that the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Catuar</span> spent a total of P2<span class="GramE">,464.00</span>
for repairs of the jeep, as shown by the receipts of payment of labor and spare
parts (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">H to H-7).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs likewise tried to prove that
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span>,
immediately after the accident was taken to Immaculate <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Hospital, and then was transferred to the National Orthopedic Hospital; that
while plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span> was not confined in the
hospital, his wrist was in a plaster cast for a period of one month, and the
contusions on his head were under treatment for about two (2) weeks; that for
hospitalization, medicine and allied expenses, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span>
spent P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Evidence also shows that as a result of the incident,
plaintiff Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, Sr. sustained injuries
on his leg; that at first, he was taken to the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Orthopedic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K), but later he was confined at the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Medical Center from July 29, to August 29, 1971 and
then from September 15 to 25, 1971; that his leg was in a plaster cast for a
period of eight (8) months; and that for hospitalization and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">medical attendance, plaintiff Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, Sr. spent no less than P13<span class="GramE">,785.25</span>
</span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">evidenced by receipts in his
possession </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">N to N-1).</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Proofs were adduced also to show that plaintiff Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, Sr. is employed as Assistant Accountant of the <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> Sugar Estate with a salary of P1<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> a month; that as sideline, he also works as accountant
of United Haulers, Inc. with a salary of P500.00 a month; and that as a result
of this incident, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> was unable to
perform his normal work for a period of at least 8 months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, evidence shows that the
other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">plaintiff </span><span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Catuar</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> is a Chief
Clerk in <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> Sugar Estate with a salary of
P500.00 a month, and as a </span>result <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
the incident, he was incapacitated to work for a period of one </span>(1) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">month.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiffs have filed this case both against Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> as driver, and against <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Duavit</span> as owner of the jeep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Duavit</span>, while admitting ownership of the other jeep (Plate
No. 99-07-F-J Manila, 1971), denied that the other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">defendant (Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>) was his
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Duavit</span>
claimed that </span>he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">has not been an
employer of defendant Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> at anytime up
to the present.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand documentary and testimonial evidence show
that defendant Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> was an employee of the
Board of Liquidators from <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1966</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="1">January 4,
 1973</st1:date> (Annex <span class="GramE">A</span> of Answer).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>, in his
testimony, categorically admitted that he took the jeep from the garage of
defendant <span class="SpellE">Duavit</span> without the consent or authority of
the latter (TSN, September 7, 1978, p. 8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He <span class="SpellE">tesfitied</span> further, that <span class="SpellE">Duavit</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">even filed charges </span>against him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for theft of the jeep, but which <span class="SpellE">Duavit</span> did not push through as his </span>(<span class="SpellE">Sabiniano's</span>) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">parents
apologized to <span class="SpellE">Duavit</span> on his behalf.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>, on the
other hand in an attempt to exculpate himself from liability, makes it appear
that he was taking all necessary precaution while driving and the accident
occurred due to the negligence of <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Catuar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> claims that it was plaintiff's vehicle which hit
and bumped their jeep." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 21-23)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>
negligent in driving the vehicle but found no employer-employee relationship
between him and the petitioner because the latter was then a government
employee and he took the vehicle without the authority and consent of the
owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner was, thus,
absolved from liability under Article 2180 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The private respondents
appealed the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January
 7, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the Court
of Appeals rendered the questioned decision holding the petitioner jointly and
severally liable with <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court in part ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We cannot go along with <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be seen that in Vargas
v. <span class="SpellE">Langcay</span>, <u>supra</u>, it was held that it is immaterial
whether or not the driver was actually employed by the operator of record or
registered owner, and it is even not necessary to prove who the actual owner of
the vehicle and who the employer of the driver is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the Supreme Court ruled, thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘We must hold and consider such
owner-operator of record (registered owner) as the employer in contemplation of
law, of the driver,’ it cannot be construed other than that the registered
owner is the employer of the driver in contemplation of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a conclusive presumption of fact and
law, and is not subject to rebuttal of proof to the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, as stated in the decision, we
quote:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'The purpose of the principles evolved by the decisions in
these matters will be defeated and thwarted if we entertain the argument of
petitioner that she is not liable because the actual owner and employer was
established by the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">xx</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.'"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Along the same vein, the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Duavit</span> cannot be allowed to prove that the driver <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> was not his employee at the time of the vehicular
accident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The ruling laid down in <span class="SpellE">Amar</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> (1966), 63 O.G. 6850, by this Court to the effect
that the burden of proving the non-existence of an employer-employee
relationship is upon the defendant and this he must do by a satisfactory
preponderance of evidence, has to defer to the doctrines evolved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>the Supreme Court in cases of
damages arising from vehicular mishaps involving registered motor vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Tugade</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 85 SCRA 226, 230).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 26-27)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The appellate court also
denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner contends
that the respondent appellate court committed grave abuse of discretion in
holding him jointly and severally liable with <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>
in spite of the absence of an employer-employee relationship between them and
despite the fact that the petitioner's jeep was taken out of his garage and was
driven by <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> without his consent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As early as in 1939, </span>we
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">have ruled that an owner of a vehicle
cannot </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">held liable for an
accident involving the said vehicle if the same was driven without his consent
or knowledge and by </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">person not
employed by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Duquillo</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span></u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(67 Phil. 131-133-134) <u>[</u>1939<u>]</u>
we said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under the facts established, the defendant cannot be held
liable for anything.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the
accident, James <span class="SpellE">McGurk</span> was driving the truck, and he
was not an employee of the defendant, nor did he have anything to do with the
latter's business; neither the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">defendant
nor Father <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span>, who was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">charge of her business, consented to have any </span>of her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">trucks driven on the day of the accident, as
it was a holy day, and much less by a chauffeur who was not in charge of
driving it; the </span>use <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the
defendant's truck in the circumstances indicated was done without her consent or
knowledge; it may, therefore, be said, that there was not the remotest
contractual relation between </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deceased
<span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Duquillo</span> and the
defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It necessarily follows from
all this that articles 1101 and following of the Civil Code, cited by the
appellant, have no application in this case, and, therefore, the errors attributed
to the inferior court are without basis."</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court upholds the above ruling as still relevant and better
applicable to present day circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">respondent </span>court's
misplaced reliance on the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Erezo</u></span><u> v.
<span class="SpellE">Jepte</span></u> (102 Phil. 103 <u>[</u>1957<u>]</u> and <u>Vargas
v. <span class="SpellE">Langcay</span></u> (6 SCRA 174 <u>[</u>1962]) cannot be
sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Erezo</u></span>
case, <span class="SpellE">Jepte</span>, the registered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">owner of the truck which collided with a taxicab, </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">which resulted in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Erezo</span>, claimed that at </span>the time of the accident, the
truck belonged to the Port Brokerage in an arrangement with the corporation but
the same was not known to the Motor Vehicles Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court sustained the trial court's ruling
that since <span class="SpellE">Jepte</span> represented himself to be the owner
of the truck and the Motor Vehicles Office, relying on his representation,
registered the vehicle in his name, the Government and all persons affected by
the representation had the right to rely on his declaration of ownership and
registration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even if <span class="SpellE">Jepte</span> were not the owner of the truck at the time of the
accident, he was still held liable for the death of <span class="SpellE">Erezo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the driver of the truck was
fully authorized to drive it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Likewise, in the </span><u>Vargas</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">case, just before the accident
occurred, Vargas had sold her <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to a third
person, so that at the time of the accident she was no longer the owner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This court, nevertheless, affirmed Vargas' liability since she failed to
surrender to the Motor Vehicles Office the corresponding AC plates in violation
of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law and Commonwealth Act No. 146.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We further ruled that the operator of record
continues to be the operator of the vehicle in contemplation of law, as regards
the public and third persons, and as such </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">responsible for the
consequences incident to its operator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The vehicle involved was a </span>public utility <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
for hire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, the law does
not only require the surrender of the AC plates but orders the vendor operator
to stop the operation of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> as a form of
public transportation until the matter is reported to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen, the circumstances of the above cases are entirely
different from those in the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Herein petitioner does not deny ownership of the vehicle involved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the mishap but completely denies
having employed the driver <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> or even having
authorized the latter to drive his jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The jeep was virtually stolen from the petitioner's garage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To hold, therefore, the petitioner liable for
the accident caused by the negligence of <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>
who was neither his driver nor employee would be absurd as it would be like
holding liable the owner of a stolen vehicle for an accident caused by the
person who stole such vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">regard, we cannot ignore the many cases of
vehicles forcibly taken from their owners at gunpoint or stolen from garages
and parking areas and the instances of service station attendants or mechanics
of auto repair shops using, without </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the owner's consent, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vehicles
entrusted to them for servicing or repair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">We </span>cannot blindly
apply absolute rules based on precedents whose facts do not jibe four <span class="GramE">square</span> with pending cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Every c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ase must </span>be
determined on its own peculiar factual circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where, as in this case, the records of the
petition fail to indicate the slightest indicia of an employer-employee
relationship between the owner and the erring driver or any consent given by
the owner for the vehicle's use, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">we </span>cannot
hold the owner liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find that the respondent appellate court committed
reversible error in holding the petitioner jointly and severally liable with <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span> to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">,</span>
