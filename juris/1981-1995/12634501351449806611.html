with preliminary injunction to review the decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA G.R. No. 09800 which dismissed a similar petition therein.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1977</st1:date>,
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span> sued the spouses Salvador Samson and
<span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson for P200<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
allegedly borrowed and received by the spouses from the plaintiff in 1970 and
1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint which also asked for
damages and attorney's fees was docketed as Civil Case No. 5641-P in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson was then in <st1:state><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:state>,
<st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but after
having been granted (through counsel) an extension of time to file a responsive
<span class="GramE">pleading,</span> she filed an answer and a motion to dismiss
through her attorney-in-fact who was assisted by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer denied the material averments of
the complaints and alleged that the P200<span class="GramE">,000</span> was not a
loan but actually payment of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span>'
indebtedness to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As counter-claim,
it prayed for damages, attorney's fees and expenses incurred by the <span class="SpellE">Samsons</span> in connection with a business venture in <st1:place>Guam</st1:place>
(<st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region> territory)
which they had with Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
pp. 17-22.)</span> The motion to dismiss was with respect to Salvador Samson
who was <span style="">said to have died in </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">California</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="">, on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="26" month="5"><span style="">May 26, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, pp. 23-24.)</span>
The motion to dismiss was never resolved by the court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the plaintiff had filed an answer to the counter-claim, the
court set the pre-trial conference and the consideration of the motion to
dismiss on <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
p. 26.)</span> The pre-trial conference was, however, re-set to <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1977</st1:date>, as jointly prayed
for by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, p. 28.)</span> Then upon motion of the
defense counsel, Atty. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>, it was moved
to <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
p. 33.)</span> Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Caluag</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> again moved for another postponement so the court re-set <span style="">the pre-trial conference to </span><st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January
 17, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, in its
order given in open court of December 21, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The order stated also:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Notify the parties and their respective counsel accordingly."
<span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, p. 36.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The order of <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December
 21, 1977</st1:date>, was served upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span> by
registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The registry return
receipt indicates that he received it on <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1978</st1:date>, which was the date for the
pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, p. 36-A.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Came <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1978</st1:date>
but no pre-trial conference was held.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, the court issued on the same day the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"When this case was called for pre-trial conference, Atty.
Ernesto A. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
Cruz appeared for plaintiff; there is no appearance for defendant,
notwithstanding the fact that as indicated in the record they were duly notified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As prayed for by plaintiff through counsel, and pursuant to
the provisions of Sec. 2, Rule 20 of the Revised Rules of Court, defendant <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson is hereby declared as in default;
plaintiff is hereby granted leave to adduce evidence <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> and the Deputy Clerk of Court is hereby commissioned
to receive the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED<span class="GramE">. "</span> <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, p. 38.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's evidence was received <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
before Atty. Eduardo S. <span class="SpellE">Retutal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>,
pp. 40-65.) On the basis of the evidence thus received, the court rendered the
decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1978</st1:date>,
with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered for plaintiff against
defendant <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sentencing defendant to pay to plaintiff the
amount of P200,000.00 with legal interest thereon from May 13, 1977, the date
of the filing of the complaint, until the same shall have been fully paid; and,</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further sentencing defendant to pay to
plaintiff the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as and for
attorney's fees.</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"With costs against defendant.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, pp. 77-78.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due time, a writ of execution was issued upon the properties
of Salvador Samson (<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, pp. 84-85) and
the Bayside Nightclub and Restaurant (at 1712 <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
Blvd., <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City) was levied upon and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span> bought it as the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
p. 94.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, non-parties to the suit became involved in the
subsequent proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the trial
court issued orders (at the instance of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span>)
requiring the lessee and operator of <span style="">the
Bayside Nightclub to deposit rental payments in court, Jade Garden Enterprises
Inc. as such lessee and operator deposited P45,000 in court, as rentals for the
month of July, 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amount was
withdrawn by Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span> (petitioners contend
that Jade Garden deposited P99<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, in all, which
was withdrawn by Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span>), Bayside, Inc.
entered a special appearance and filed a motion to recall the court's order
requiring Jade Garden Enterprises to deposit rentals in court on the ground
that it was the owner of Bayside Nightclub and not the <span class="SpellE">Samsons</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, the heirs of Salvador Samson, represented by <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Samson, entered a special appearance and filed a
motion to quash the writ of execution on the ground that it was directed upon
the properties <span style="">of Salvador Samson,
while </span>the <span style="">judgment was against <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson who arrived
in the Philippines on October 12, 1978, filed a verified <u>Omnibus Motion</u>,
asking the court to set aside the order of default, the judgment by default and
all the subsequent proceedings on the ground that (a) the defendant and counsel
were not duly notified of the January 17, 1978, pre-trial conference, (b) the <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> reception of plaintiff's evidence was null and
void, and (c) the defendant had valid and meritorious defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
pp. 114-125.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In an <u>Omnibus Order</u> of <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1979</st1:date>, the court, among other things, denied the
separate motions of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Samson and <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>, pp. 138-140.)</span>
A joint motion for reconsideration (by the heirs of Salvador Samson and <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson) was subsequently denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, unable to find relief, <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span>
Samson, the heirs of Salvador Samson and the Bayside, Inc. elevated the matter
to the Court of Appeals (in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
with preliminary injunction, CA G.R. - 09800), which however dismissed the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 189-198.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a last resort <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson, the
heirs of Salvador Samson and Bayside, Inc. have come to us.</p>

<p class="BODY">In two separate resolutions, the parties (upon manifestation of
their counsels) were granted 60 days within which to settle the case
amicably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, counsel for
petitioners manifested that <span style="">settlement seemed
remote, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 259-260) which prompted the
private respondent to pray for a decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 262.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case is before us on the sole issue which would foreclose
discussion of other questions raised by petitioners, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not the Samson spouses were denied
due process when they were declared in default for non-appearance at the <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1978</st1:date>, pre­trial
conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' main thrust is that <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span>
Samson was denied due process because she was declared in default, notwithstanding
the fact that she and her counsel, Atty. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>,
were not duly notified of the <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1978</st1:date> pre-trial conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondent, in contending that the
Samson spouses (as original defendants) and their counsel were duly notified,
goes as far back as the pre-trial set for <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1977</st1:date>, and to the postponements at the
instance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>
was served with notice of the <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1978</st1:date>, pre-trial conference by registered mail, and that the <span class="SpellE">Samsons</span> were also served by registered mail at <st1:address><st1:street>1712
  <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Blvd.</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:city></st1:address> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that the order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1977</st1:date>, re-setting the pre-trial
conference on <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1978</st1:date>,
was served by registered mail upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The registry return receipt or card, attached
to the copy of the order of <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December
 21, 1977</st1:date>, indicates that he received it on <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1978</st1:date>, which was the date of the
pre-trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is also this notation in handwriting, at the back of the
copy of the order of <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21,
 1977</st1:date>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Reg. Mail
1/17/78, 1) Atty. B. Salvador, 2) Atty. Rodolfo M. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>,
3) Mr. Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span>, and 4) Spouses Samson."</p>

<p class="BODY">Noting the registry return receipt for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>
and the notation at the back of the order of December 21, 1977, the Court of
Appeals concluded that the <span class="SpellE">Samsons</span> and their counsels
were duly served with notice; it attached the presumption of regularity in the
performance of official duties to the trial court when it issued the order of
default stating, among other things, that "there is no appearance for
defendant, notwithstanding the fact that as indicated in the record they were
duly notified."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the position of the petitioners tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For want of notice of pre-trial conference, <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Samson was denied due process, and consequently,
the validity of the order of default and all the proceedings that transpired
subsequent thereto can not be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only registry return card in respect of the pre-trial
conference set for <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1978</st1:date>,
is the card attached to the back of the Order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expe</u>­<u>diente</u></span>,
p. 36.)</span> It shows that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span> received
the order on <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such notice to counsel is patently
irregular, having been served on him on the very day of the re-set pre-trial
conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the petitioners contend,
how could the order of default state that as indicated in the records, the
defendants were duly notified, when the registry return card indicating service
of <span style="">notice on Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>,
could not have been with the court on January 17, 1978, since Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span> received it only on the same day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that notice to counsel was not irregular, still such
notice is neither adequate nor sufficient for purposes of pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been consistently held that notice of
the pre-trial conference must be served not only upon the counsel but upon the
party litigants as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And before a
party can be declared in default for failure to appear at the pre-trial, it must
be shown that notice of pre-trial conference had been duly served upon both the
party and counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it can not be said that the Samson spouses were duly
notified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The handwritten notation at
the back of the order of <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21,
 1977</st1:date>, to the effect that the order had been served on them cannot
be deemed sufficient proof of notice by registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no registry return card attached to
the <span class="SpellE"><u>expediente</u></span> to show service of the
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the case of Salvador
Samson he could not have been served with notice by registered mail because he
had long been dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the corresponding entries in the trial court's
list of registered <span class="GramE">mail,</span> and even in the official
records of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Post Office we were
missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so the parties hurl
insinuation at each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This only points
to the absence of indubitable proof of the private respondent's assertion that
the <span class="SpellE">Samsons</span> were duly served with notice of the
pre-trial conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that the January 17, 1978, pre-trial conference was
a re-set, after some postponements at the instance of the defense counsel,
cannot justify the absence of due notice because there is no proof that the
defendants and their counsel were present in court when the order of <span style="">December 21, 1977, was issued for otherwise
it would not have been </span>necessary for the court to order:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Notify the parties and their res­pective
counsel accordingly."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the allegations and counter-allegations of the parties in
their respective pleadings, it would appear that no less than a full-dress
hearing on the merits is necessary for a just and fair resolution of the
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so, when as it turned out,
even non-parties became involved in the subsequent proceedings, something which
could have been avoided if only the parties had been given opportunity to
thresh out the issues in a full-dress trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted, the decision of the
Court of Appeals is reversed, and the <span class="GramE">order of default as
well as all subsequent proceedings in the trial court are</span>
rescinded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court shall
initially resolve the motion to dismiss and set the case for pre­trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the
respondent.</span></p>
