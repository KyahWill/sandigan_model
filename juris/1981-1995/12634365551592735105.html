hit him at the back of his head, the lone bullet entering behind his right ear
and exiting below his left near the neck.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For the death of Sonny, MARIO BARTE was charged with <u>Murder</u>
but convicted by the trial court of <u>Murder With Use of Unlicensed Firearm</u>,
pursuant to P.D. 1866, as amended.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> But
to this day Mario Barte denies the charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution largely rests its theory on the testimony of
Jovita Capua, widow of the victim, who recounted that on 18 September 1989, at
about six o'clock in the evening, she and her husband were at their canteen in
Tebag, Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan.  They
were attending to their customers among whom were Ernesto Sapatero, Mario
Catunggal and accused Mario Barte,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> a
barangay councilman of Tebag West.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> After
the customers were served eleven bottles of beer, Mario Barte left.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Meanwhile, her husband sat down to rest, his back leaning against the wooden
grilled window.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She was, on the other hand, standing in front of her husband and facing him
while wrapping the dog meat which was ordered by another customer.  She could have a view of the outside through
the window grilles.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
A few minutes later, at about six-thirty, her husband was shot from behind by
appellant who was outside the canteen.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She readily recognized appellant as she immediately looked at him
after he shot her husband.  She was<span style=""> </span>able to identify appellant as the
place was illuminated by two light bulbs:  a 25-watt installed outside the canteen where he was, and a 50-watt
inside the canteen where she and her husband were.  She knew the appellant very well since they were childhood
"barangaymates."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> After
her husband was shot, she was brought to her sister's place to be calmed down
as she was hysterical, and later transferred to Matic-Matic, to the house of
Barangay Captain Ernesto de Guzman, a cousin of her husband,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
where she stayed for about an hour.  There, at about eight-thirty that same evening, she was questioned by a
police officer.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Three days later, or on 21 September 1989, she executed a sworn statement
pointing to appellant as the assailant of her husband.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also presented M/Sgt. Rodrigo Escaño, an officer
detailed in the Firearms and Explosives Unit, Camp Crame, who testified that
appellant was not a licensed firearm holder.  M/Sgt. Escano identified the certification issued by his Commanding
Officer that appellant was "not a licensed/registered firearm holder of
any kind and caliber per verification from available records on file."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The final witness for the prosecution was Dr. Teresa N. Peralta,
Rural Health Physician of Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan, who confirmed the autopsy
report she made and maintained that the cause of death was
"Cardiorespiratory Arrest Secondary to Hypovolemic Shock Secondary to
Gunshot Wound."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, accused-appellant denied any participation in the
killing, claiming that while he was indeed in the canteen of the Capuas at
around five-thirty that afternoon, he went home at about <span style="">six </span>o'clock and stayed home until
midnight.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To corroborate his alibi, the accused presented Municipal
Councilor Onofre Palaganas who was drinking in the canteen at the time of the
incident.  Palaganas confirmed that the
accused left the canteen at about six o'clock that evening.  Then, at about seven twenty-five, he heard a
gunshot.  He stood up and saw the victim
already sprawled on the ground.  He did
not see the assailant;<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
neither did he notice appellant return to the canteen.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The victim's wife, Jovita, was at the back; she was crying.  When asked who shot her husband, her answer
was, "I don't know, Kuya."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense then presented Cpl. Ernesto Parayno, one of those who
went to the crime scene to investigate.  Corporal Parayno narrated that when he arrived at the canteen,
"[n]o one could tell who really is (sic) the suspect,"<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the wife of the deceased could no longer be questioned as she was
already hysterical.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> But
Pat. Jaime Tamayo, who was with Cpl. Parayno at that time, recounted that he
was able to ask Jovita Capua who killed her husband but she said she did not
know.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also called Pfc. Aldin Poserio who conducted a
follow-up investigation.  He narrated
that a day after the incident, appellant was first invited to the local police
station and then brought to the National Bureau of Investigation in Dagupan
City where he was subjected to a paraffin test.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> The
findings showed that "[t]he diphenylamine test for nitrates performed on
the above-mentioned specimens gave NEGATIVE RESULTS."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 December 1991, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 44, Dagupan
City,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>rendered judgment finding
accused-appellant guilty of <u>Murder with Use of Unlicensed Firearm</u> and
sentenced him to<i> reclusion perpetua</i>.  Thus -</p>

<blockquote>The Court believes that the killing was perpetrated with the use of
an unlicensed firearm.  First, it was
established that accused Mario Barte is (sic) not a licensed/registered firearm
holder of any kind and caliber x x x x [A]s the killing was committed with the
use of an unlicensed firearm, and in view of the provision of paragraph 2 of
Section 1 of PD 1866 which codifies the laws on illegal/unlawful possession of
firearms and ammunitions or explosives, the maximum penalty should be imposed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, we are not persuaded by appellant's profession of
innocence.  The testimony of Jovita
Capua clearly establishes his guilt.  It
was given in a straightforward, detailed and unequivocal manner,
notwithstanding the gruelling cross-examination <span style="">by </span>defense counsel who grilled the grieving widow for four days,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
asking a wide range of seemingly irrelevant questions, e.g., from what time of
the day the food in their canteen was cooked to what kind of meat was used for
the <i><span style="">adobo</span></i><span style=""> </span>they served.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
She was nevertheless able to demonstrate lucidly what transpired that fateful
evening and to identify appellant positively as her husband's assailant.  In fact, the cross-examination even
supplemented and reinforced her direct testimony which, on its own, was already
crystal-clear.  Thus, on the second day
of her cross-examination, she unflinchingly narrated -</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A witness who </span><span style="">testifies in a candid, categorical and
consistent manner is a credible witness.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Consequently, if credible and
positive, the testimony of a single witness is sufficient to convict.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, she remained consistent and free from self-contradiction during the
four days that she was cross-examined.</p>

<p class="BODY">We simply cannot set aside the factual findings of the trial
court absent any showing of capriciousness on its part.  Here, appellant did not even impute
arbitrariness to the trial court.  Hence, its factual findings must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused, on the other hand, merely came out with alibi to
establish his innocence.  But his alibi
remains uncorroborated.  Weak as his
alibi may be, it becomes even weaker when it is not bolstered by any other
piece of competent evidence.  Councilor
Palaganas merely confirmed that appellant left the canteen at about six o'clock
that evening.  He was not certain
whether appellant returned thereafter.  Neither could Palaganas assert that accused-appellant only stayed home
that evening.  Hence, aside from his
bare allegation, appellant's alibi that he was at home at the time of the incident
remains unsubstantiated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, we have said time and again that for an alibi to
prosper, the accused must show that it was impossible for him to have been at
the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.  This, appellant failed to do.  In fact, the records show that he could have easily returned to the
canteen after he left at around six o'clock that evening, considering that his
house was only 50 meters away.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the positive identification of the appellant as the
perpetrator of the crime by the widow has completely demolished his alibi.  We have consistently ruled that the defense
of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused.  Jovita was admittedly in <span style="">a </span>position to see and identify the
killer of her husband who was only three (3) to four (4) meters away.  The place was sufficiently lighted and he
was her childhood barrio mate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Perhaps aware of the weakness of his defense in view of his
positive identification, appellant argues that "the identification made by
Mrs. Capua does not deserve the consideration of the court"<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
as she was not able to name the assailant of her husband when asked at the
scene of the crime by both defense witnesses Councilor Palaganas and Pat.
Tamayo.  This is inconsistent with the
testimony of defense witness Cpl. Ernesto Parayno, who eventually became the
Station Commander of the Philippine National Police in Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan

<p class="BODY">After a careful assessment of the evidence, we find the version
of the prosecution more in harmony with human nature, while the testimony of
the witnesses for the defense is burdened with material inconsistencies, hence,
we affirm the court <i>a quo</i>.  Indeed, Jovita could have been hysterical upon seeing her husband
murdered right before her eyes.  Thus,
she had to be led away and brought somewhere else to calm her down.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense apparently attempts to muddle the events by
insinuating that the wife of the victim admitted that she was able to talk to a
police officer at the crime scene that same evening where she allegedly said
she did not know who killed her husband.  The record however discloses that the inquiry took place <span style="">in </span>the house of Barangay Captain
Ernesto de Guzman, away from the scene of the crime.  This the defense failed to discuss or clarify, much less refute.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense then creates a fallacy when <span style="">it </span>cites <b><span style="">People v.
Mendoza</span></b><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where we said that "[t]he
(Diphenylamine or Paraffin) test is not conclusive as to the presence of gunpowder
because fertilizers, cosmetics, cigarettes, urine, and other nitrogenous
compounds with nitrites and nitrates will give a positive reaction, citing
Pedro Solis, <i>Legal Medicine</i> (1987), p. 380,"<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
and states the quoted portion <span style="">in </span>the

Since accused-appellant was found negative for nitrites and nitrates, counsel
for the defense concludes that appellant could not have fired a gun.  Certainly, this conclusion does not follow.  Defense counsel seems to have purposely
omitted our clarification in <b>People v. Mendoza</b> which immediately follows

thus -</p>

<blockquote>This (Diphenylamine or Paraffin) test has proved extremely
unreliable in use.  The only thing that
it can establish is the presence or the absence of nitrates or nitrites on the
hand.  It cannot be definitely
established from this test alone that the source of nitrates or nitrites was
the discharge of a firearm.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that the prosecution has proved the guilt of the
accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt; that the commission of the offense
was attended with treachery; that the unsuspecting, defenseless victim was
fatally shot from behind; and, that the offender employed means to insure the
slaying without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended
party might make.  However, we cannot
agree with the trial court that the accused should be convicted of <u>Murder
with Use of Unlicensed Firearm</u> under P.D. 1866, considering that nowhere in
the Information is it alleged that he used an unlicensed firearm.  The Information merely states that "the
above-named accused, armed with a <u>short</u> firearm, with deliberate intent
to kill, with treachery x x x x did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously shot SONNY CAPUA x x x x" Hence, even if the prosecution has
established that accused-appellant was not legally issued any firearm to
qualify the crime to <u>Murder with Use of Unlicensed Firearm</u>, we cannot
convict him for this particular offense as that would violate a fundamental
constitutional precept, i.e., that the accused shall have the right to <span style="">be fully </span>informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the accused can only be declared guilty of <u>Murder</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We however sustain the sentence imposed by the court <i>a quo</i>,
i.e., <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, as this is the correct penalty imposable for <u>Murder</u>,
absent any modifying circumstance, under the Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
This is the same sentence imposed by the trial court in view of the
proscription of the death penalty under the 1987 Constitution, which the trial
court would have otherwise imposed for the crime of <u>Murder with Use of
Unlicensed Firearm</u> under P.D. 1866.  To the civil indemnity granted by trial court to the heirs of Sonny
Capua in the amount of P50,000.00, we further award P20,000.00 for moral
damages and P10,000.00 for death and burial expenses, both of which were proved
during the trial but were either overlooked or simply ignored by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we find the accused MARIO BARTE guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of <u>Murder</u> as charged, not of <u>Murder
with Use of Unlicensed Firearm</u> as found by the trial court.  However, we sustain the imposition of <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> by the court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>as it is the correct penalty for <u>Murder</u>.  In addition to the civil indemnity of
P50,000.00, we award to the heirs of the deceased Sonny Capua P20,000.00 for
moral damages and P10,000.00 for death and burial expenses, with costs against
accused-appellant Mario Barte y Cabusas.</p>
