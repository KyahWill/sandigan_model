				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the
conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the
judge to the least and lowest of its personnel - hence, it becomes the
imperative sacred duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good
name and standing as a true temple of justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, to upkeep public faith and confidence in <span style="">the </span>administration of justice, We find essential to emphasize
the relevance of the aforesaid pronouncement in this administrative complaint
of inexcusable negligence against Deputy Sheriff Rolando <span class="SpellE">Macapugay</span>
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>In W.C. Case No. BLO-58, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Agres</span> (deceased),
substituted by his surviving widow, etc., et al. vs. National Soy Factory, the
Workmen's Compensation Commission ruled in favor of claimant <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Agres</span> represented by
his widow Maria A. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Agres</span>
<span style="">and </span>ordered the National Soy
Factory to pay claimant the total sum of P6,661.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that, in satisfaction of the said award, the
National Soy Factory immediately caused to be issued Manager's check No. 24991
of the Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation (Grace Park Branch) dated <st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1973</st1:date> in the amount of
P6,661.00, payable to the order of Maria A. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Agres</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In acknowledgment, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Agres</span> signed the voucher
prepared by the National Soy Factory<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and the same was witnessed by Deputy Sheriff Rolando <span class="SpellE">Macapugay</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant as the Manager of National Soy Factory, claims that
although more than two (2) years have already elapsed from <st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1973</st1:date>, Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Macapugay</span> continuously failed to make the proper sheriff's
return to the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the latter issued an Alias Writ of
Execution dated December 17, 1975 directing the Office of the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City to serve said alias writ upon the National Soy
Factory; that complainants were surprised to receive such writ of execution
considering that they have already completely paid the claim recited in said
alias writ; that when the sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
levied on their valuable personal property, they suffered sleepless nights,
wounded feelings, mental anguish, tortured moments and <span class="SpellE">bismerched</span>
reputation because it appears that they refused to pay a legal obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the truth was that they have already
completely and fully paid said claim, although they could not immediately find
a copy of the aforementioned proof of payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It took the Charter Insurance (their insurer) one month to locate the
documents of payments because of floods that occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">When required to comment, the respondent admitted <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that he failed to make
the return to the Workmen's Compensation Commission at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> "for the reason
that the same was inadvertently placed among the court processes
folder-envelopes already returned to different courts in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respondent's admission of the material allegations as set
forth in the complaint, We find him negligent in failing to make a return of
the writ, in violation of Section 11, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Return of
writ of execution. - The writ of execution may be made returnable to the clerk
or judge of the court issuing it, at any time not less than ten (10) nor more
than sixty (60)days after its receipt by the officer who must set forth in
writing <span style="">on its back </span>the whole of
his proceedings by virtue thereof, and file it with the clerk or judge to be
preserved with the other papers in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A certified copy of the record, in the execution book kept by the clerk,
of an execution by <span style="">virtue </span>of
which real property has been sold, or of the officer's return thereon, shall be
evidence of the contents of the originals whenever they, or any part thereof,
have been lost or destroyed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">His
</span>actuation of unwarranted delay did not only cause wounded personal feelings
and humiliation to complainant but also "more importantly impairs public
faith and confidence in the administration of justice by our courts,"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
warranting an administrative sanction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the respondent is hereby found guilty of the
charge of inexcusable negligence in the performance of his duties and is
ordered suspended from office for a period of two (2) months without pay
effective upon notice, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or
similar offense will be dealt with more severely.</p>
