Petitioner seeks the reversal of the decision of the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission in WCU Case No. 356 entitled Vivencio Omison, 
claimant vs. Province  of Negros Occidental (Provincial Engineer's 
Office) respondent, dismissing his claim for disability benefits which 
was earlier granted to him by the Workmen's Compensation Unit at Bacolod
 City.
<p>
The antecedent facts are not disputed.  As summarized by Referee 
Pacifico Militante of the Workmen's Compensation Unit, Bacolod City, 
they are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As could be reflected from the pleadings and evidences adduced by
 the parties, the claimant appears to be under the employ of the 
respondent since the year 1939 continuously up to May 16, 1973, with 
assignment as construction helper (caminero or street caretaker), and 
receiving a monthly salary of P240.00 (Service Record).  The nature of 
his duties were to clean, maintain, pave and helps (sic) in the 
construction of bridges, and to perform all maintenance and construction
 works of national road in the Province of Negros Occidental.  As such, 
he is used to be exposed to all the climactic changes of the elements of
 nature.  He likewise did some heavy lifting of beams and boulders 
needed in the construction projects and was usually exposed to the heat 
of the fire and obnoxious odor of the asphalt in its heating and melting
 process.  That in the late 1960's he began to notice that his body 
resistance had lowered very much and he become easily susceptible to 
colds and afternoon fever.  In 1972, he was prompted to consult Dr. 
Raymundo Guerrero and was given prescription of medicines for TB.  He 
also consulted Dr. Genato Llamas, Sr. and Dr. Genato Llamas, Jr. and was
 given further medicines for his ailment with an advice to have himself 
x-rayed. (Physician's Report, Dr. Genato Llamas, Jr.).  On April 5, 
1973, x-ray examination at the Negros Occidental Chest Clinic revealed a
 findings of "PTB, moderately advance, Active".  Again on June 25, 1974,
 he was x-rayed by the same Dr. Amador C. Antonio, Phthisiologist, (sic)
 Negros Occidental Chest Clinic, and the findings was "PTB, minimal, 
Questionably Active."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On May 15, 1973, the petitioner applied for retirement under 
Commonwealth Act 186 as amended due to his alleged physical inability to
 continue his work as a result of his illness.  His application was 
approved and his last day of actual service was on May 15, 1973.
</p><p>
On June 21, 1973, the petitioner filed a claim for disability benefits 
under the Workmen's Compensation Act against the Province of Negros 
Occidental before the Workmen's Compensation Unit, Bacolod City.
</p><p>
On October 7, 1975, the Workmen's Compensation Unit through referee 
Pacifico Militante issued a decision granting disability benefits in 
favor of the petition.  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The matter fully considered, this Office then reached the 
conclusion that this claim is compensable, and, therefore, orders the 
respondent Province of Negros Occidental and/or Provincial Engineer's 
Office of Negros Occidental, to pay: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        (1)  To the claimant, under Section 18 of the Act, the sum of <em>P5,213.57,</em>
 computed as follows: Claimant's illness has been evaluated and 
certified to by Dr. Antonio Habana, Compensation Rating Medical Officer,
 this Office, dated October 1, 1975 to be 90% NSD. 50% of claimant's 
average weekly wage of P55.38 (P240.00 x 12+52) equals P27.69 multiplied
 with 90% of 208 weeks or 187.2 weeks equals P5,213.57;
    </p>
    <p>
        (2)  To the claimant, under Sec. 15 of the Act, as reimbursement
 of medical and hospital expenses and doctor's Bills, as certified to by
 Dr. Antonio Habana, this Office, the sum of <em>P525.75</em>;
    </p>
    <p>
        (3)  Atty. Romeo Bernaje, claimant's counsel, as attorney's fees under Section 31 of the Act, the sum of <em>P260.68</em>;
    </p>
    <p>
      (4)  To this Office, as administrative fee under Section 55 of the Act, the sum of <em>P53.00;</em> </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
All Payments must be coursed thru this Office.
</p><p>
On appeal by the province of Negros Occidental the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission reversed and set aside the afore-mentioned 
decision.  Hence, the instant petition.
</p><p>
The Workmen's Compensation Commission rejected the petitioner's 
disability benefits claim on the premise that there was no evidence 
presented to the effect that as a result of his sickness the petitioner 
was either physically incapable of continuing his work or that his 
earning capacity was impaired.  The Com­mission reasoned out its ruling 
in the following manner:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xx<span style="">x</span></span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "x x x Under the law, compensable ailments are those which produce
 physical disability or which impairs the earning capacity of the 
employee.  Further, it is an essential requirement under the Act, that 
in order to impose liability upon the employer for the payment of 
compensation benefits, it is essential that the illness which caused the
 physical disability be causally related with the employee's work or 
employment.  In the instant case, claimant asserted that he first felt 
the symptoms of his illness in 1960.  It was only in 1972 that he 
consulted a physician.  There is, however, no showing that claimant has 
applied for sick leaves for a considerable length of time, showing 
incapacity for work before he stopped working on May 16, 1973.  
Obviously, therefore, there is no evidence which shows that claimant has
 been incapacitated or work due to a compensable illness or injury.  It 
may be true that he was afflicted with PTB, minimal, probably active.  
At this stage PTB is curable.  A careful scrutiny of the evidence, 
however, does not show any proof that claimant was physically 
incapacitated for work due to such ailment.  Yet, the Compensation 
Rating Medical Officer has rated claimant's disability at 90% of 
non-scheduled disability under Section 18 of the Act.  We do not find 
any factual basis for the doctor's evaluation.  As a matter of fact, 
there is no showing that claimant ever suffered temporary disability.  
Hence, there is no justification of granting him permanent partial 
disability under Section 18 of the Act.  We take note of the admissions 
by claimant in his affidavit when he stated that his service has been 
continuous until May 16, 1973.  This, alone, is an adequate indication 
that claimant was never incapacitated for work with the respondent.  In 
the absence of any proof of physical disability, claimant shall not be 
entitled to disability compensation benefits under Section 2 of the Act.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is apparent that the Commission equates disa­bility compensation 
benefits with claimant's physical incapacity to perform labor by reason 
of his illness.  This conclusion is unwarranted.  As stated in <em>Makabali v. Employees' Compensation Commission</em> (126 SCRA 174) citing <em>Corales v. Employees' Compensation Commission</em> (88 SCRA 555):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x We have recognized the fact that an employee medically 
pronounced disabled for work can, despite thereof, pursue his work by 
sheer determination and ingenuity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
"In the subsequent cases of Romero vs. WCC, et al. (77 SCRA 480, June 
30, 1977) and Gonzales vs. WCC, et. al. (81 SCRA 709-710), We enunciated
 that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Disability, as a basis for compensation, is the combination of 
partial or total physical incapacity and of inability to work, or 
inability to work with the same case and competency as before the 
injury, or the loss, total or partial, of earning power from the injury 
(Corpus Juris, Section 535, p. 813). </p>
  <p> "Disability is used either in the medical or physical sense, as 
evidenced by obvious loss of members or by medical testimony that the 
claimant simply cannot make the necessary muscular movements and 
exertions; it is used to mean <em>de facto</em> inability to earn wages, as evidenced by proof that claimant has not in fact earned anything. </p>
  <p> "This medical and wage-loss aspects of disability may be more 
clearly illustrated as follows:  A claimant may be, in a medical sense, 
utterly shattered and ruined, but may be sheer determination and 
ingenuity contrive to make a living for himself; conversely, a claimant 
may be able to work, in both his and doctor's opinion, but awareness of 
his injury may lead employers to refuse his employment. </p>
  <p> "The problem of the administrators of the Act is the proper 
balancing of these medical and wage-loss factors.  An absolute 
insistence on medical disability in the abstract would produce a denial 
of compensation in the latter case, although the wage-loss is a real and
 as directly traceable to the injury as in any other instance.  At the 
other extreme, an insistence on the wage-loss as the best would deprive 
the claimant in the former illustration of an award, thus not only 
penalizing his laudable efforts to make the best of his misfortune but 
also fos­tering the absurdity of pronouncing a man non-disabled in spite
 of the unanimous contrary evidence of medical experts and of common 
observation (Larson, Vol. II, p. 3)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, the fact that the petitioner rendered continuous service until 
his retirement does not imply that he can not claim disability 
compensation benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Besides, 
his motivation not to be absent from his work despite his tuberculosis 
must have been due to the fact that he was a daily-wage earner.  He 
needed the money.
</p><p>
The petitioner entered his employment as construction laborer (caminero)
 with the private respondent in 1939 presumably in good health.  It was 
only in the 1960's or after a period of more than twenty one (21) years 
that sickness became manifest as he noticed that his body resistance had
 lowered and he became easily susceptible to colds and afternoon fevers.
  Apparently, through the years and in the course of his employment he 
contracted sickness which gradually aggravated.  Thus, in 1972, he 
consulted physicians who gave him prescriptions of medicines for 
pulmonary tuberculosis.  On April 5, 1973 he had an x-ray examination at
 the Negros Occidental Chest Clinic which revealed findings of "PTB 
moderately advanced active".  The nature of the petitioner's work was 
such that he was exposed to dust, heat and sudden climatic changes which
 could have caused or aggravated his illness.  These circumstances show 
that the petitioner's illness supervened and was aggravated in the 
course of his employment with the private respondent.  The presumptions 
of compensability and the criteria for work connection and work 
aggravation under the old Workmen's Compensation Act's provisions on 
compensability apply.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the decision of the Employees' Compensation Commission is 
hereby SET ASIDE and the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Unit, 
Bacolod City is REINSTATED.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
