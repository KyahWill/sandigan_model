having been filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>AC-G.R.

1985 of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> affirming
the decision of the Municipal Trial Court of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
by ejecting the petitioner, in Civil Case No. 5083 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Reyes, as Judicial <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>
of the Estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz v. <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Orata</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered from the records, the facts of the case are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Reyes <span class="SpellE">vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz (private respondent) is a judicial <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the property of her late husband <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since 1961 the year she was appointed by the
Court as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, she personally demanded
payment of rental on the lot owned by her deceased husband <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz from <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Orata</span>, the petitioner, but the latter refused for the
reason that she has already paid her rental to the grandson of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1980</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Reyes
filed Civil Case No. 5083 against <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Orata</span> for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> before the
Municipal Court of San Juan, Metro Manila, for non-payment of rental in the amount
of P25.00 a month (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "D", p.
48).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Orata</span> argued that she paid her rental in November, 1979 to
March, 1980 to <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
because the latter inherited the property from <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, his grandfather, who had been renting the
lot to petitioner since 1946 until <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz died in
1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She paid her rent up to the
present to <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,
without knowing that <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Reyes is the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> as the latter was not the one who rented the
lot to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
<u>ibid</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Second Division of this Court in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1986</st1:date> gave due course to
the petition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Petition, pp. 2-31; Resolution,
p. 102).</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not the petition for
review filed in the Court of Appeals which was obviously filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, may still be considered in the
interest of substantial justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the petition in the case at bar was
filed out of time, the reckoning thereof being counted from the receipt of the
decision on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1985</st1:date>
and not from the denial of the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counting the fifteen (15) day period from March 9, 1985, the
petition should have been filed on March 24, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The running of the period was, however,
interrupted by the filing of the motion for reconsideration on March 18, 1985,
thereby leaving a balance of six (6) days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said motion for reconsiderÂ­ation was denied and received by the
petitioner on May 2, 1985 and the period commenced to run again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Adding the balance of six (6) days the
petition should have been filed on May 8, 1985 instead of May 17, 1985 which is
nine (9) days later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In fact a motion for reconsideration is not a
prerequisite to an appeal, a petition for review or a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
(<span class="SpellE">Habaluyas</span> Enterprises, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Japson</span>,
142 SCRA 209 [1986]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 45 of the Judiciary Act as amended by Republic Act No.
6031 does not allow an appeal by record on appeal and notice of appeal from a
CFI decision in an appealed case<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the municipal or city
courts, but the remedy is a petition for review (<span class="SpellE">Landicho</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Tensuan</span>, 151 SCRA 410 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petiÂ­tion for review of the RTC decision
must be filed within the fifteen (15) day period to appeal, which is the period
for filing a petition for review of a final judgment or order of the RTC in an
appeal from a final judgment or order of a municipal circuit trial court,
municipal trial court and the metropolitan trial court (<span class="SpellE">Servicewide</span>
Specialist, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 79778, September 21, 1988).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, this Court has in a number of cases, in the
exercise of equity jurisdiction decided to disregard technicalities in order to
resolve the case on its merits based on the evidence (St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc.
v. <span class="SpellE">CleoÂ­fas</span>, 121 SCRA 287 ]1983]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is well settled that litigations should, as much
as possible, be decided on their merits and not on technicalities (<span class="SpellE">Galdo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, 84 SCRA 239,
242-243 [1978]); that every party-litigant must be afforded the amplest opportuÂ­nity
for the proper and just determination of his case, free from unacceptable plea
of technicalities (Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> Morales v. Court
of Appeals, 67 SCRA 304; 310 [1975]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court has ruled further that being a few days late in the filing of
the petition for review does not merit automatic dismissal thereof (Serrano v.
Court of Appeals, 139 SCRA 179 [1985]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And even assuming that a petition for review is filed a few days late,
where strong considerations of substantial justice are manifest in the
petition, this Court may relax the stringent application of technical rules in
the exercise of its equity jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition to the basic merits of the main case, such a petition
usually embodies justifying circumstances which warrant Our heeding the
petitioner's cry for justice, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the earlier
negligence of counsel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming back to the case at bar, it is readily evident that this
case has a good cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
it appears more appropriate to consider the petition on its merits rather than
to dismiss it on technicalities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that in the late 1979 up to the early part of
1980 when demand letters were sent by Reyes to the petitioner to pay the rent
to her, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> was still the registered owner of the
property (TCT No. 436125 of the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> RegisÂ­try of
Deeds).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His title was cancelled only on
November 9, 1983, three (3) years after the filing of this case in 1980.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when respondent Reyes sent a demand
letter to the petiÂ­tioner on October 17, 1979 to pay the rent to her, and when
her <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> complaint was filed on May 24, 1980,
the title of the leased premises was still in the name of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since a certificate of title is conclusive evidence of ownership
in favor of the person named therein (<span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> v. RiveÂ­ra,
et al., 64 Phil. 13 [1937]) and every person dealing with registered land may
safely rely on its correctness (Director of Lands v. <span class="SpellE">Abache</span>,
et al., 73 Phil. 606 [1942]), petitioner was in good faith in paying the
rentals to her <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,
who was in fact the registered owner, also up to November 9, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">Payment in good faith to any person in possession of the credit
shall release the debtor (Article 1242, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, after <span class="SpellE">Teodoro's</span> title
was cancelled on November 9, 1983, the new title that replaced it was issued in
the name of his grandparent, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
de la Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a grandson and legal heir
of the registered owner, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Teodoro</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> was a
co-owner of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Payment of the
obligaÂ­</span>tion to him discharged the debtor, but he (<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>)
should account to the other co-owners for their share of the credit (Articles
500 and 1214, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since petitioner has not defaulted in the payment of her rental
obligation as lessee of the property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
</span>question, the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> thereof has no
cause of action for her <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">But thereafter, the petitioner should pay the rentals to the
private respondent as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the estate of
the deceased registered owner, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED; the questioned
decision and resolution are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE; and the complaint
for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> is hereby DISMISSED.</p>
