				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On the basis of an unverified motion, may a court validly issue <i><u><span style="">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></u></i><span style=""> </span>a so-called "<i><u>statu</u></i><i><u><span style="">s</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span></i>order" which could operate either as a
temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction?</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the main issue in this case which the following factual
and procedural antecedents have generated:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 September 1920, the Smith Bell and Company leased from the
Government, through the Bureau of Lands, Blocks 144 and 145, containing an area
of 9,023.36 square meters, located at the Port Area, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lessee transferred all its leasehold
rights to the Philippine Building Corporation on 27 May 1946, which the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assignee was able to renew the lease
contract, but transferred in 1952 all its rights under the lease agreement to
S. Villanueva Enterprises, Inc. (SVEI), which secured on 1 September 1969 a
renewal of the contract for another 25 years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On 26 November 1986, the then Minister of General Services ordered the
cancellation of the contract for violation by SVEI of its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SVEI appealed the order to the Office of the
President which affirmed it in its Order of 29 September 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">SVEI's</span> several
motions for reconsideration were denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last denial, which affirmed with finality the 29 September 1987
Order, was issued on 29 January 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, on <span style="">17 </span>March
1988, the President issued Executive Order No. 321 expanding the territorial
area of the South Harbor Zone of the Port of Manila and placing the whole area
under the jurisdiction of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 March 1989, the PPA wrote SVEI informing the latter of <span class="SpellE">PPA's</span> intention to take possession of the leased premises
and demanding payment of P728,861.38 representing accrued rentals and
interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 30 June 1989, SVEI offered
to restructure its obligations provided that the PPA assured it in writing that
the contract of lease will not be terminated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In its letter of 22 August 1989, the PPA rejected the proposal and
instead demanded that SVEI vacate the premises within thirty (30) days from
receipt of the letter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the PPA caused to be published a notice of bidding of
Blocks 144 and 145 to be held on 28 November 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SVEI, however, filed on 23 November 1989 a
complaint for Specific Performance, with prayer for preliminary injunction
and/or restraining order against the PPA with Branch 38 of the Regional Trial
Court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint sought to
enjoin the PPA from conducting the scheduled bidding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case No.
89-51192.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SVEI invoked its right to
remain in the premises until 1994 by virtue of its 25-year renewed contract of
lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court issued a writ of
preliminary injunction enjoining the PPA from proceeding with the bidding.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on 22 March 1990, the PPA filed with the
Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case
against SVEI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case <span style="">was </span>docketed
as Special Civil Action 131889-CV and was assigned to Branch 5 of said court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon </span>the <span class="SpellE">PPA's</span> motion to dismiss Civil Case No. 89-51192, on the
ground that the lease contract had already been cancelled, and such
cancellation was affirmed by the Office of the President, and that there is a
pending <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, Branch 38 of the Regional
Trial Court of Manila, through Judge Arturo <span class="SpellE">Barias</span>,
Jr., issued on 30 August 1990 an Order dismissing the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held that the Government had sufficient
ground to cancel the contract of lease in view of the violations of its terms
by SVEI and that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>Secondly, the
mere fact that there is <span style="">an </span><span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court of
Manila, the Court is of the opinion and so holds that all the issues raised
herein, more specifically that of possession, should better be threshed out in
the metropolitan trial court involving as they do (sic) the same parties and
the same subject matter.<span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">SVEI
appealed </span>the <span style="">order to the Court
of Appeals where it is still pending resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In line with its plan to
fully maximize the utility of Block 145, the PPA decided to improve and
renovate it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto, it caused
to be published </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">issues </span><span style="">of the Manila
Bulletin of 17, 22 and 29 October 1990 an Invitation to <span class="SpellE">Prequalify</span>
</span><span style="">and </span><span style="">Bid for the lease and
rehabilitation-development of Block 145.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Per the published notice, the opening of sealed bids was set for 28
November 1990 at 2:00 P.M.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 27 November 1990,
herein private respondents Port Area Realty, Inc., Everett Steamship Corporation,
Harbor Import Shopping Center, Oriental Media, </span><span style="">Inc., </span><span style="">and Ester <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> Lim, on her behalf and on behalf of others similarly
situated, claiming to be actual occupants of the building located in Block 145,
filed a petition</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> with the Regional Trial Court of Manila for
Specific Performance with preliminary injunction and/or </span><span style="">restraining </span><span style="">order against the Philippine Ports Authority, the Department of
Transportation and Communication, Atty. Juan C. Sta. Ana, in his capacity as
Chairman of the Bidding Committee and the members thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim to be <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>
of Block 145, which is now a commercial complex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private </span>respondents Port Area Realty,
Inc. and Harbor Import Shopping Center allege that they developed their
respective areas into shopping stalls which they leased to interested
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Oriental
Media alleges that it is using a portion of its premises for its printing
machines but had the rest developed into stalls which are leased to other parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Everett Steamship claims
that it is using the premises for its offices while private respondent Lim
avers that she is one of the stallholders.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">They attached to the
petition a copy of the Order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Barias</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was docketed as Civil Case No. 90-55248 and was
assigned to Branch 31 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila which is presided
over by respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">As their cause of action, private respondents allege in their
petition that the offer to bid Block 145 is patently discriminatory and
deprives them of their property rights without due process of law as there was
no notice to them, much less a<span style=""> call for
a meeting, despite the knowledge of the PPA-Port District of Manila that they
developed, improved and spent for the establishment of the complex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are "small-time" and
struggling businessmen who "could not afford and easily win in such
bidding," and that in order to prevent such discrimination and deprivation
of their property rights, they should be allowed to negotiate with the
Government on such terms and conditions that are appropriate, reasonable and
just.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They then pray that the court
issue an order restraining the defendants from continuing with the bidding of
Block 145 and that if it is already auctioned off, </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">annul the sale and direct the defendants to negotiate with them </span>for
a <span style="">contract of lease, rehabilitate,
operate and/or manage Block 145 under such terms as are reasonable, just and
proper and that after trial, render judgment making the preliminary injunction </span><span style="">permanent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent Judge
issued on 28 November 1990 a temporary restraining order (TRO) which was,
however, served only after the bidding; the bidding itself was declared a
failure because only two (2) bidders participated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants, petitioners
herein, filed an opposition to the application for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was later followed by their Answer
wherein they plead the following special and affirmative defenses:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs, are mere <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>
of S. Villanueva Enterprises Inc. (SVEI); the contract in favor of the latter
was cancelled, the validity of which cancellation was upheld in the Order of 30
August 1990 in Civil Case No. 89-51192.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) <span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case
against SVEI is pending; considering that a judgment in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case is binding not only upon the defendant but also against the latter's <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>, privies, agents and/or successors-in-interest,
then the complaint should be dismissed on ground (sic) of <span class="SpellE"><i><u>litis</u></i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendencia</u></span>;</i> moreover, plaintiffs are guilty
of forum-shopping.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs do not have better rights than
SVEI; are bidders and/or possessors in bad faith; their possession of Block 145
does not create any vested right; have not availed of appropriate
administrative remedies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A negotiated contract, as suggested by
plaintiffs, is never a mode to ensure any party the award of a contract."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">and
interpose a counterclaim for temperate and exemplary damages.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The application for injunction was heard on 7 January 1991 with
the private respondents presenting their first witness, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Luzano</span>, president of the port Area Realty, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing<span style=""> </span>was ordered set for continuation on 15, 17 and 22 January <span style="">1991.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On
15 January 1991, counsel for private respondents moved for postponement and the
hearing was reset for 29 January 1991.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On said date, the parties manifested to the court that they had agreed
to consider the injunction incident moot <span style="">and
</span>academic because the act sought to be enjoined had already been
accomplished. Respondent Judge dictated in open court an order declaring the
application for injunction as "deemed abandoned." By agreement of the
parties, the pre-trial conference was set for 28 February 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the PPA caused to be published in the 7, 14 and 21 February
1991 issues of the Manila Bulletin another Invitation to <span class="SpellE">Prequalify</span>
and Bid for the "lease, renovation and operations of Block 145,"
setting the pre-bid conference on 16 April 1991 and the submission and opening <span style="">of </span>sealed bids on 25 April 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 February 1991, private respondents moved for the
postponement of the pre-trial on the ground that they had not yet received the
notice of pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre-trial was
reset for 16 April 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 April 1991, a day before the pre-trial conference, private
respondents filed in Civil Case No. 90-55248 an <span style="">unverified Urgent Motion for the Issuance of a Status Quo Order,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> alleging therein as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Honorable Court has already lapsed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for
the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction was then in progress before it
was abandoned because of Defendants' assurance that there would be no public
bidding to be conducted during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Defendants, in violation of this
agreement, are intending and threatening to conduct as in fact, a public
bidding of the premises was (sic) scheduled to be conducted on April 25, 1991
which, if completed, would render the issues in this case moot and academic.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">and
praying that “a status quo order be issued enjoining the Defendants and their
agents from continuing the scheduled public bidding on April 25, 1991 until
after the issues shall have been resolved by the Honorable Court.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This motion does not
contain any notice of hearing to counsel for the defendants (petitioners
herein).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a notice of hearing
but it is addressed to the Clerk of Court and reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Clerk of Court </blockquote>

<blockquote>RTC-Manila</blockquote>

<blockquote>Greetings:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Kindly set the afore-stated Motion for
resolution and approval of the Honorable Court on April 15, 1991 at 9:00 A.M.
or as soon thereafter at the convenience of the Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Above this notice is an

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting on the aforesaid

in this action their vested rights to enter into negotiations in lieu of public

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When the case was called
for pre-trial on 16 April 1991, as earlier agreed upon by the parties, counsel
for private respondents asked for </span>a <span style="">postponement on the ground that one of them, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bandayrel</span>,
had not yet prepared his Pre-Trial Brief, while the other, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Jurade</span>, claimed that his client, Oriental Media, Inc., had
not received its notice of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite the objection by counsel for herein petitioners, respondent
Judge reset the pre-trial for 16, 23 and, 30 May 1991.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners then filed on
22 April 1991 the instant petition without even moving for a reconsideration of
the </span><i style=""><u><span style="">status</span></u></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><u><span style="">quo</span></u></i><u><span style=""> </span></u><span style="">order in view of the urgent necessity for relief pleaded by the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Our Resolution of 24
April 1991, We required the respondents to comment on the petition and issued a
Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the respondent Judge, his agents,
representatives and/or any person acting upon his orders or in his place or
stead from enforcing and/or carrying out the above Order of 15 April
1991."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners herein assert
that respondent Judge committed grave abuse of </span>discretion in issuing the
challenged <i style=""><u>status</u></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><u>quo</u></i>
order since private respondents' unverified urgent motion for its <span style="">issuance does not allege any fact or show any
clear legal right to justify it and that it was heard without notice to
petitioners; additionally, it was issued without requiring private respondents
to put up a bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their Comment filed on</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">6
May 1991, respondents allege that they did not pursue their prayer for a
preliminary mandatory injunction because of the assurance of petitioners that
the public bidding shall not be held while the resolution of the </span><span style="">issues i</span><span style="">n </span><span style="">the case remain
pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since petitioners
disregarded that commitment, private respondents had to rush to the court <i><u>a</u>
<u>q</u></i></span><i><u>uo</u></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">for the issuance of a restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter argue, </span><i style=""><u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span></i><span style="">, that </span><span style="">what the respondent judge issued was not a preliminary injunction but
"merely a temporary restraining order, which, as mandated </span>by <span style="">law, lapses </span><i style=""><u>ipso</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vigore</u></span></i><span style=""> after twenty (20) days from its
issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the legal basis for its
issuance, that is, without hearing and without requiring the putting up of a
bond, should not be under question.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their Reply filed on
26 June 1991, petitioners insist that the </span><i style=""><u>status</u> <u>quo</u></i><span style="">
order of 15 April 1991 is a "writ of preliminary injunction, but whether
it is a temporary restraining order or a “writ of preliminary injunction, the
same was issued despotically and without the least legal basis.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is to be considered a temporary
restraining order, it is, in effect, an extension of the 28 November 1990 TRO,
which would be irregular and unlawful per <span class="SpellE"><u>De</u><u><span style="">falobos</span></u></span></span><span style=""> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquilizan</u></span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Moreover,
private respondents are not entitled to the writ since the complaint fails to
show a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, there

claim is a blatant lie, for, at the hearing on 7 January, when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bandayrel</span> for the private respondents sought to make a
misrepresentation on this point, </span><span style="">his
</span><span style="">scheme was immediately aborted,

with a new theory, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="BODY">We do not hesitate to grant the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is impressed with merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt at all that respondent

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge knew, or

simple rules and settled doctrines:</p>

<blockquote>"To emphasize once more, the directives in Section 2 of Rule
37 and Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Court are as
mandatory as they are clear and simple; and non-compliance therewith is fatal
to the cause of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, because the mere filing
of the motion for reconsideration, without the requisite notice of hearing,
does not toll the running of the period for appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
sets the time and place of hearing in the notice and serves the adverse party
with the same, the court would have no way to determine whether the party
agrees to or objects to the motion, and if he objects, to hear him on his
objection, since the rules themselves do not fix any period within which to
file his reply or opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rules
commanding the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> to serve on the adverse party a
written notice of the motion (Section 2, Rule 37) and that the notice of
hearing ‘shall be directed to the parties concerned, and shall state the time
and place for the hearing of the motion’ (Section 5, Rule 15), do not provide
for any qualifications, much less exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To deviate from the peremptory principle thus uniformly reaffirmed <span style="">in the latest cases <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
in, and to exempt from the rigor of the operation of said principle, the case
at </span>bar <span style="">would be one step in the
emasculation of the revised rules and would be subversive of the stability of
the rules and jurisprudence thereon -- </span>all <span style="">to the consternation of the Bench and Bar and other interested persons
as well as the general public who would thereby be subjected to such an
irritating uncertainty as to when to render obedience to the rules and when
their requirements may be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had to draw a line somewhere and WE did when we promulgated on January 1, 1964
the Revised Rules of Court, wherein WE delineated in a language matchless in
simplicity and clarity the essential requirements for </span>a <span style="">valid notice of hearing on any motion, to
eliminate all possibilities of equivocation or misunderstanding."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The urgent motion for a <i style=""><u>status</u></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><u>quo</u></i> order is

still patently insufficient in form and in substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is sought to be enjoined is "the
