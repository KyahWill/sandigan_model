Assailed in this petition is the Order dated October 15, 1981 of the 
then Court of First Instance of Tarlac, Branch I, in Special Proceedings
 No. 766 covering the Intestate Estate of Florencio P. Buan and Rizalina
 Paras-Buan, denying the Omnibus Motion filed by petitioners Blesilo 
Buan and Florencio Buan, Jr. principally praying for the closure of the 
intestate estate proceedings of their deceased parents, and their 
applications for precautionary measures against respondent 
Administratrix A. Natividad Paras-Nisce.
<p>
The antecedent facts, in brief, are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    On January 3, 1953, petitioners' parents, Florencio P. Buan and 
Rizalina Paras-Buan, owners of Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines and several 
other properties, died in a motor vehicle accident.  They were survived 
by their five then minor children:  Jesusa Janina, 12 years old; Lourdes
 Palmyra, 5; Florencio, 4; Valentino, 3; and Blesilo, 11 months.
  </p>
  <p>
    On January 9, 1953, intestate proceedings were commenced.  
Respondent Natividad Paras, younger sister of the orphans' mother, still
 single then, and Bienvenido Buan, younger brother of their father, were
 appointed co-administrators of the estate of the deceased spouses.  
They were also appointed guardians of the children in Special Proceeding
 No. 1099.
  </p>
  <p> In 1957, the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines was in­corporated.  The 
Buan estate was the majority stockholder with 1,992 shares of stock with
 a par value of P100.00 per share, or 99.67%, with the co-administrators
 and the other stockholders, Ricardo L. Paras, Mariano P. Buan, 
Simplicio P. Buan, Diosdado L. Paras, Alejandro Paras, Jr. and Lauro P. 
Pascual, subscribing to one share of stock each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon authorization to increase its capital stock from two million to five million pesos<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  having been obtained, the administrators filed on May 25, 1964, a 
Petition to Waive Estate's Pre-emptive Right to Subscribe to the 
Increase of Capital Stock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  This was granted by respondent Court on May 27, 1964.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  The Certificate of Increase of Capital Stock of Philippine Rabbit Bus 
Lines, Inc. shows that administrators Bienvenido Buan and Natividad 
Paras-Nisce subscribed to 9,100 shares of stock each in the total amount
 of P1,820,000.00.  The six remaining stockholders also bought 
additional shares:  Ricardo L. Paras and Mariano P. Buan, 1,000 shares 
each; Simplicio P. Buan, Diosdado L. Paras, Alejandro Paras, Jr. and 
Lauro P. Pascual, 500 shares each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  The controlling interest of the estate was thereby reduced to barely 
35% as against the co-administrators and other relatives 65% interest in
 the outstanding capital.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the interim, the co-administrators formed other corporations, the Tarlac Development Bank and Bupar Motors Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tarlac Development Bank was organized on July 5, 1961.  It has an 
authorized capital of P2 million and an actual subscription of 
P1,070,000.00.  The Development Bank of the Philippines subscribed and 
paid for P500,000.00 in preferred stock.  Of the common stock, the Buan 
estate subscribed and paid for shares worth P350,000.00; respondent 
administratrix and her husband Ramon Nisce to P65,000.00; Bienvenido P. 
Buan and his wife to P65,000.00; the co-administrators' respective 
brothers, Ricardo L. Paras and Mariano P. Buan, to P10,000.00 each.  The
 capitalization was later increased to P3 million.  Petitioners have no 
knowledge of the present status of the stockholdings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Bupar Motors Corporation was put up on March 25, 1963 for the 
purpose of engaging in the business of assembly (including bus body 
building), sale and distribution of motor trucks, spare parts and tire 
recapping.  The Buan estate subscribed to P50,000.00 worth of shares 
from the authorized capital of P1 million.  Co-administrator Bienvenido 
P. Buan subscribed to P50,000.00 worth of shares; respondent 
administratrix and her husband to P50,000.00; Ricardo L. Paras and 
Mariano P. Buan to P25,000.00 each.
  </p>
  <p>
    On August 21, 1964, the capitalization was increased to P3 million. 
 The estate subscribed to P850,000.00 worth of shares; respondent 
administratrix and her husband to P700,000.00; co-administrator 
Bienvenido P. Buan to P175,000.00; Ricardo L. Paras to P175,000.00; 
Mariano P. Buan to P100,000.00; and Diosdado L. Paras to P100,000.00.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bupar Motors Corporation became the purchasing arm of Philippine 
Rabbit Bus Lines Inc.  An entire tire section of the bus company was 
transferred to Bupar.  A parcel of land with a concrete building 
belonging to the Buan estate was sold to Bupar Motors for P135,000.00.  
In the petition to waive pre-emptive right to subscribe to the increase 
of the capital stock of Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines Inc., the 
co-administrators gave as reason therefor, the estate's alleged 
controlling interest in this Bupar corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> On March 26, 1965, the heirs Jesusa Janina Buan-Monteyro and 
Lourdes Palmyra Buan-Tabamo, filed an Omni­bus Motion praying among 
others, for their appointment, either, solely or jointly, as 
administratrices of the estate of their late parents, and on April 11, 
1965, an Alternative Motion to Close Administration Proceedings on the 
ground that the administrators were not taking positive steps to close 
the intestate proceedings instituted some twelve years back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    On October 20, 1965, the sisters filed a Supplemental Omnibus Motion
 for (1) Immediate Removal of Co-Administrators, (2) Annulment of 
Illegal Subscription, (3) Return of Shares, (4) Setting Aside Order, (5)
 Contempt, principally assailing the actuations of the co-administrators
 in filing the Petition to Waive Estate's Pre-emptive Right to Subscribe
 to the Increase of Capital Stock, and their subsequent purchase 
themselves of additional stock, which reduced the estate into a minority
 stockholder.  The administrators filed an opposition thereto.
  </p>
  <p>
    On February 24, 1970, administrator Bienvenido Buan died, and respondent Administratrix continued managing the estate alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another corporation was organized by respondent Administratrix on 
May 11, 1970, the Ledi Realty Enterprises Inc., with an authorized 
capital of P1 million.  The principal stockholders are respondent 
Administratrix and her husband, with a subscription of P280,000.00.  Her
 brother Diosdado L. Paras, subscribed to P1,000.00 worth of shares.  
The heirs Florencio Buan, Jr. and Valentino Buan were made to appear to 
have subscribed to P160,000.00 and P59,000.00 worth of shares of stocks,
 respectively.  On May 20, 1970, the corporation bought the inheritance 
rights in the estate of petitioners' sisters and co-heirs, Janina and 
Palmyra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    On October 2, 1974, the sisters finally moved to withdraw the pleadings they had filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  The lower Court granted the same on October 7, 1974.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    On February 23, 1981, petitioner Blesilo Buan, with the conformity 
of his co-heirs Janina Buan-Monteyro, Lourdes Palmyra Buan and Florencio
 P. Buan, Jr., filed a Petition for Letters of Co-Administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  Their brother Valentino died on February 27, 1970.  Respondent 
Administratrix expressed her conformity to the same in a Manifestation 
filed on April 3, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  
After hearing, the Court, on April 9, 1981, appointed Blesilo P. Buan as
 co-administrator of the estate of the deceased spouses upon filing of a
 bond of P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    On June 19, 1981, Blesilo and Florencio, Jr., filed an Omnibus 
Motion praying, principally, for the closure of the intestate 
proceedings, having been long deprived of the possession of their 
inheritance, and, subsidiarily, for some precautionary remedies by 
reason of alleged breaches of trust committed by respondent 
Administratrix.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In particular, the precautionary or provisional orders prayed for are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(1) an order immediately suspending respondent A. Natividad 
Paras-Nisce as administratrix of the estate, enjoining her exercise of 
its powers and performance of its duties; </p>
  <p>
    (2)  an order enjoining respondent A. Natividad Paras-Nisce from 
disposing or in any way encumbering any of her stockholding interests 
whether held in her name or in the names of her trustees or nominees in 
Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc., Bupar Motors Corporation, Tarlac 
Development Corporation and Ledi Realty Enterprises Inc. charged to have
 been 'seized and developed at the expense and with the facilities of' 
the estates;
  </p>
  <p>
    (3)  an order enjoining, respondent A. Natividad Paras-Nisce from 
causing Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines Inc., Bupar Motors Corporation and 
Ledi Realty Enterprises Inc. charged to have been 'seized and developed 
at the expense and with the facilities of' the estates to effect any 
disposition or encumbrance of their assets or to incur any new 
obligations without prior authority from the court;
  </p>
  <p>
    (4)  an order instructing and directing the respondent A. Natividad 
Paras-Nisce to deliver to petitioner-administrator Blesilo Buan all the 
properties of the estate including real properties, the stockholding 
interests in Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines Inc., Bupar Motors Corporation,
 Tarlac Development Bank, and Ledi Realty Enterprises Inc. for him to 
take and receive said properties and hold and administer than as such 
administrator; and
  </p>
  <p> (5)  since the properties of the estate particularly the real 
properties have been mortgaged by respondent A. Natividad Paras-Nisce to
 secure loans for the use of the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines Inc., an 
order enjoining said respondent A. Natividad Paras-Nisce or petitioner 
administrator Blesilo Buan to see to it that the Philippine Rabbit Bus 
Lines Inc. regularly service its obligations obtained on the security of
 the properties of the estate and, for the purpose, to order them to 
cause Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines Inc. to retain the services of an 
established auditing firm to take charge of daily collections from the 
buses and the other sources of income like the canteen and to control 
the disbursements of funds so that only legitimate  expenses of 
operations are met and the balance kept and preserved to pay the 
obligations of the corporation obtained on the security of the 
properties of the estate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Respondent Administratrix opposed the Motion denying the charges of 
breach of trust and stating that the delay in the closure of the estate 
was not caused by her, but was due to the pendency of actions for 
damages filed against the administrators of the estate, which have 
remained pending over the years, and that the heirs Janina Buan-Monteyro
 and Lourdes Palmyra Buan had already sold, transferred and conveyed 
their hereditary rights over the estate to the Ledi Realty Enterprises, 
Inc..
</p><p>
On October 15, 1981, respondent Court issued the challenged Order, decreeing:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "xxx   xxx this Court resolved and hereby declares and holds that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        (1) There is no necessity of issuing an order enjoining the 
administratrix Natividad Paras-Nisce from performing any act of 
administration whether involving disposition or mere administration of 
any and all of the properties of the estate, not only because there is 
no ground for the issuance of said order but also because based on the 
records, the administratrix has heretofore invariably sought and 
obtained the approval of this Court for the acts of administration 
involving the disposition of the properties of the estate;
    </p>
    <p>
        (2)  For insufficiency of evidence and lack of legal basis (see 
Secs. 3 and 5[b] P.D. 902-A), the prayer in the Omnibus Motion that the 
administratrix Natividad Paras-Nisce be enjoined from disposing or in 
any way encumbering any of her stockholding interests whether held by 
her in her name or in the name of her alleged trustees, her husband 
Ramon Nisce, Ricardo L. Paras, Diosdado L. Paras     and Mariano P. Buan
 in Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc., Bupar Motors Corporation, Tarlac 
Development Bank, and Ledi Realty Enterprises, Inc. is hereby denied;
    </p>
    <p>
        (3) The prayer in the Omnibus Motion that an order be issued 
enjoining the administratrix Natividad Paras-Nisce from causing 
Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc., Bupar Motors Corporation, Ledi Realty
 Enterprises, Inc. to effect any disposition or encumbrance of their 
assets or to incur any new obligation without prior authority from this 
Court is denied for lack of merit and for the added reason that this 
Court is of the opinion that under the present law (Secs. 3 and 5 [b] 
P.D. 902-A), it has no jurisdiction to issue such an order;
    </p>
    <p> (4) The prayer in the Omnibus Motion that an order be 
immediately issued instructing and directing the administratrix 
Natividad Paras-Nisce to deliver all the properties of the estate 
including real properties, the stockholding interests in Philippine 
Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. Bupar Motors Corporation, Tarlac Development 
Bank, Ledi Realty Enterprises, Inc. and all other businesses and 
properties allegedly seized and developed at the ex­pense and With the 
facilities of the estate and instructing and directing the 
co-administrator Blesilo Buan to take and receive said properties and 
hold and administer them as such administratrix is hereby denied for 
lack of merit and for insufficiency of evidence; </p>
    <p>
        (5) The prayer in the Omnibus Motion that an order be issued 
enjoining the administratrix Natividad Paras-Nisce and the 
co-administrator Blesilo Buan to see to it that the Philippine Rabbit 
Bus Lines, Inc. regularly service its obligations obtained on the 
security of the properties of the estate and, for this purpose, to order
 them to cause Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. to retain the services 
of an established auditing firm to take charge of daily collection from 
the buses and to control the disbursement of funds so that legitimate 
expenses of operations are met and the balance kept and preserved to pay
 the obligations of the corporation obtained on the security of the 
properties of the estate is likewise denied for lack of merit and for 
insufficiency of evidence;
    </p>
    <p> (6) The prayer in the Omnibus Motion that an order be issued 
after hearing to approve the alleged partial project of partition that 
the admi­nistrator Blesilo Buan shall submit pursuant to the alleged 
extra-judicial agreement entered into among the heirs and to order the 
administrator Blesilo Buan to effect such alleged partial distribution 
of the estate is hereby denied, no such partial project of partition 
having been submitted to his Court; </p>
    <p>
        (7) The prayer in the Omnibus Motion that an order be issued 
requiring the administratrix Natividad Paras-Nisce to submit accounting 
of her, administration within fifteen (15) days from date of the order 
has become moot and academic, it appearing from the records that the 
aforesaid Administratrix had on July 1, 1981 filed and already submitted
 her accounting from the year 1976 to 1980.  Let the accounting 
submitted by the Administratrix for the years 1976 to 1980 be set for 
hearing on December 7, 1981, at 8:30 in the morning;
    </p>
    <p>
        (8) The Administratrix having filed her opposition to the 
Omnibus Motion embodying therein and in her Rejoinder her answer to the 
charges of alleged breach of trust, let the hearing of the charges of 
trust filed by the movants Blesilo Buan and Florencio Buan, Jr. be set 
for hearing on November 23, 1981, at 8:30 o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the same reasons already stated in the order of this Court of 
October 4, 1965 and more specifically because of the prevailing doctrine
 laid down by a unanimous Court in Ang Chia vs. Dinglasan, 88 Phil. 476,
 the petition to close this estate not being legally feasible at this 
time is hereby denied.
</p><p>
Resolution of paragraphs 9 and 10 of the petitory portion of the Omnibus
 Motion of June 18, 1981 is hereby held in abeyance until after the 
charges on alleged breach of trust shall have been heard and submitted 
for resolution and as requested by counsel for movants-heirs."
</p><p>
Petitioners sought reconsideration of the foregoing Order but respondent Court denied it on February 2, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
</p><p>
Petitioners allege:
</p><p align="center">
I
</p><p align="center">
"Respondent Court erred in not ordering the closure of administration now twenty eight years too long.
</p><p align="center">
II
</p><p align="center">
The Probate Court erred in denying closure of administration already 
twenty eight years long just for a few remaining pending separate damage
 suits against the estate arising from vehicular accidents.
</p><p align="center">
III
</p><p align="center">
Respondent Court erred in citing the first order denying closure issued sixteen years ago.
</p><p align="center">
IV
</p><p align="center">
Respondent Court erred in denying the precautionary remedies applied for
 notwithstanding prima-facie showing of breach of trust."
</p><p>
The glaring problem in this case is that the intestate case below, which
 was instituted in 1953, is still pending despite the lapse of 30 years,
 mainly on the proposition that damage suits filed against the 
administrators in connection with the land transportation business of 
the decedents have prevented the settlement of the estate.  No account 
has been taken of the fact that the land transportation business was 
incorporated in 1957 as the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc.  Since the
 estate became the owner of practically all the shares of stock of the 
corporation, the damage suits, thereafter, should have also become the 
responsibility of the corporation.
</p><p>
At the time of incorporation, the administrators and the corporation 
technically became "alter egos", each in respect of the other.  The 
administrators would still be liable for obligations of the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  Similarly, the corporation would have to be liable for the debts of the administrators.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A new corporation taking over all of mortgaged assets of old 
corporation in exchange for all of old corporation's capital stock and 
continuing to operate business formerly operated by old corporation was 
'alter ego' of old corporation so as to be obligated to pay annual 
patent royalty which old corporation was required to pay, 
notwithstanding that old corporation retained title to mortgaged assets.
  Dummer v. Wheeler Osgood Sales Corp., 88 P.2d 453, 458, 198 Wash. 
381."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should be rather clear that, as between the estate and the 
corporation, the intention of incorporation was to make the corporation 
liable for past and pending obligations of the estate as the 
transportation business itself was being transferred to and placed in 
the name of, the corporation.  That liability on the part of the 
corporation, vis-a-vis the estate, should continue to remain with it 
even after the percentage of the estate's shares of stock in the 
corporation should be diluted.
</p><p>
The case of Dinglasan vs. Ang Chia, 88 Phil. 476 (1951), upon which 
respondent Court relied in denying closure, will not apply, first, 
because the litigation involved therein was for the recovery of real 
property and, second, it was the only property of the estate left 
subject of administration such that whatever was determined in the civil
 case would have had far-reaching effects in the determination and 
distribution of the estate.  In this case, however, the damage suits 
bear no intimate connection or close interrelation with the estate <em>per se</em>, specially after incorporation.
</p><p>
It should also be borne in mind that vehicular accidents are a risk 
inherent in transportation business, and as long as this business 
continues in operation, accidents are bound to occur from time to time 
with the consequent filing of suits by persons who may be injured.  To 
await the termination or settlement of all these suits before closing 
the intestate proceedings will virtually place the estate under 
perpetual administration contrary to the intendment of the law.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, 1) a) the lower Court Order, dated October 15, 1981, denying 
the closure of the estate is hereby SET ASIDE and, presuming that estate
 and inheritance taxes have been paid, said Court or the corresponding 
Regional Trial Court to which this case is as­signed, is hereby ordered,
 not liter than three (3) months after receipt hereof, to distribute the
 assets of the estate to the heirs or their assignees, or their 
successors-in-interest, according to the rules on intestate succession 
or as the heirs may agree;
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    b)  The lower Court shall continue hearings, until final disposition
 of the exceptions of the heirs to actions previously taken by the 
administrator(s), with the Court taking account of Article 2029 of the 
Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    c)  The lower Court shall see to it that the lawyers of Philippine 
Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. shall defend all pending suits against the former
 administrators, in the understanding that any judgment rendered in 
favor of plaintiffs shall be satisfied by said corporation.  Should the 
corporation refuse to pay the judgment, the administrator may file 
corresponding complaints against the corporation, and the Court may also
 authorize the heirs to sue said corporation, if necessary;
  </p>
  <p>
    d)  The lower Court shall submit a report to this Court within ten 
(10) days from expiration of the period in paragraph 1(a) above on the 
steps it has taken in implementation of this decision.

period given in paragraph 1(a) above, and to submit a report to this 
Court within ten (10) days from the expiration of said period;
