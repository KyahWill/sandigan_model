Petitioner Rey Borromeo, a patrolman of the Cebu City Police Department,
 was accused of grave threats.  Before the trial, the Assistant City 
Fiscal filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complainant, 
Francisco Castillo, had manifested his lack of interest to prosecute the
 case; but said motion was denied by the City Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
<p>
The case of the prosecution against the petitioner may be summarized as 
follows:  At about 8:30 o'clock in the evening of March 4, 1968, while 
the complainant and his cousin, Renato Castro, were conversing at Fuente
 Osmeña, Cebu City, they saw the petitioner "escorting his 
[complainant's] sister, Rosa Castillo," with the arm of petitioner 
around her shoulder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  
Piqued by what he saw the complainant immediately accosted Rosa and 
asked:  "Why are you going with this man, you let our parents believe 
that you would no longer go with him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  Petitioner instantly drew his service revolver, pointing it at the 
complainant, and told him:  "Luthangon ta ka karon" (meaning, "I will 
shoot you now").  Holding the petitioner's hand downwards, Rosa drove 
her brother away.  He went home and reported the incident to his 
brother-in-law, Eugenio Amores.  Afterwards, the complainant, 
accompanied by his sister Apolinaria and his brother-in-law, proceeded 
to the police precinct at Fuente Osmeña and, then, to the headquarters 
of the Cebu Police Department to report the incident and file a 
complaint.  The complainant's cousin, Renato Castro, was also presented 
as witness by the prosecution to corroborate the complainant's 
testimony.
</p><p>
The defense version is quite different.  It is claimed that at the time 
and place mentioned, petitioner and Rosa Castillo, law students and 
classmates at the Colegio de San Jose Recoletos, passed by Fuente Osmeña
 on their way to her dormitory to get back a book that Rosa had borrowed
 from petitioner; that at the said place Rosa's younger brother, 
Francisco Castillo, suddenly appeared and angrily threatened petitioner 
as follows:  "Patyon ta ka bay kon mosigi ug kuyog ni Rosa" (which means
 "I will kill you if you continue to accompany Rosa"); that he simply 
ignored Francisco as suggested by Rosa who explained that her relatives 
disapproved of her being seen together with him.  This version was 
corroborated by Rosa Castillo who categorically testified that 
petitioner did not threaten her brother Fran­cisco with his service 
revolver.
</p><p>
Two other witnesses, Lt. Generoso Andrin and Patrolman Jose Oporto, also
 testified for the defense.  They declared that when Renato Castro was 
asked in the course of their investigation if he witnessed the alleged 
incident, he answered that he did not because he was at that time buying
 some cigarettes.
</p><p>
After trial, rejecting totally the evidence adduced for the accused, the
 City Court of Cebu found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt as charged 
and he was sentenced to suffer imprisonment of one (1) month and one (1)
 day of <em>arresto mayor</em> and to pay a fine of fifty (P50.00) pesos with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, plus costs.
</p><p>
This judgment was appealed by the petitioner to the Court of Appeals.  
There, the Solicitor General submitted a brief with the following 
observations, among others:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Being the sister of the complainant, Rosa Castillo ordinarily 
would declare in favor of her brother since blood is thicker than water.
  Rosa Castillo and her brother, complainant Francisco Castillo, were in
 good terms for when Rosa told her brother to go home after the alleged 
incident, the latter obeyed immediately (pp. 51-52, tsn, January 15, 
1969; pp. 205-206, tsn, June 27, 1969).  <em>In the absence</em> of any <em>evidence</em> that<em> bad blood</em> <em>existed</em> between <em>Rosa</em> and <em>her brother</em>, the complainant, we are constrained to <em>support</em> appellant's view that <em>she testified</em> with <em>candor</em> and that <em>appellant did not really threaten</em>
 the complainant with a revolver.  On this particular point, we find no 
reason why Rosa's testimony should not be given proper weight, 
considering that she was an eyewitness to what transpired between 
appellant and her brother.  Being a <em>law student,</em> she was <em>intelligent</em> and <em>competent</em> enough to recall and narrate the true facts.  Above all, there was <em>no reason</em> for her <em>to fabricate</em> and testify in a manner <em>detrimental to her brother's cause.</em> </p>
  <p> "On the other hand, if there was bad blood that existed, it might 
be between appellant and Eugenio Amores, the instigator of this case 
which might have been generated by the cases filed by Amores and his 
wife, Apolinaria, against appellant and vice versa. </p>
  <p> "Moreover, we cannot just close our eyes to the testimony of the 
police officers (Lt. Generoso Andrin and Patrolman Jose Oporto) of 
Precinct 6, Cebu City Police, which further bolster the appellant's 
claim that he did not commit the crime charged.  These peace officers, 
who are duty bound to enforce the law, conducted an investigation of the
 case upon complaint of Eugenio Amores, complainant's brother-in-law, 
just after the occurrence of the incident on March 4, 1968 (pp. 135-137;
 January 16, 1969).  The result of the investigation conducted by said 
police officers pointed to the innocence of the appellant since no prima
 facie case could be established against the latter." (p. 141, tsn, 
January 16, 1969.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and recommended acquittal of the petitioner, the prosecution having failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
However, declaring that it was of the "same mind" as the lower court and
 disbelieving the defense witnesses, the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  affirmed the appealed judgment, except as to the penalty imposed which was increased to two (2) months and one (1) day of <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium period, there being no mitigating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
A motion for rehearing/reconsideration was filed by the peti­tioner on the ground of new and material evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  It was denied by the appellate court.  A second motion for rehearing/reconsideration was likewise rejected.
</p><p>
The instant petition filed by the petitioner, alleging grave abuse of 
discretion on the part of appellate court, was initially dismissed.  
Subsequent motions for reconsideration and supplemental petitions were 
successively denied for lack of merit.  At this point, complainant 
Francisco Castillo, allegedly to clear his conscience, filed with this 
Court a motion wherein he insisted that petitioner Rey Borromeo is an 
"innocent man" and that as complaining witness he had testified against 
the petitioner because he was threatened by the City Judge with perjury 
should he recant; and prayed that he be allowed to appear before the 
Supreme Court (First Division) to answer questions concerning the 
innocence of the peti­tioner.
</p><p>
Asked to comment, the Solicitor General gave the observation that the 
grounds relied upon by movant were not meritorious and that the movant 
was not the proper party to file the motion.  However, the attention of 
the Court was invited to the original recommendation for <em>acquittal</em> made by the Office of the Solicitor General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  which in part reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In fine, we believe that the prosecution evidence is not enough 
to sustain appellant's conviction and is not of the kind that can 
produce moral certainty in an unprejudiced mind.  Faced with the 
evidence for the defense which is more preponderant, overwhelming, and 
above all, credible, the conclusion is inevitable that appellant (Rey 
Borromeo) deserves <em>acquittal </em>of the offense charged." (p. 12, People's Brief) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon due consideration of the motion of the complainant, Francisco 
Castillo, as well as the comment of the Solicitor General (which 
reiterated the foregoing recommendation as "still our position), the 
Court calendared the case for hearing and required both petitioner 
Borromeo and said complainant "to appear personally at said hearing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  After the hearing and compliance by the complainant and the petitioner
 with the Court's resolution requiring the submission of proper 
pleadings and a certified photostat copy of the marriage contract 
showing that petitioner was married to Rosa Castillo, etc., and 
considering the various pleadings filed, this Court resolved to give due
 course to the instant petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p><p>
In lieu of a brief for the respondents, the Solicitor General filed a 
manifestation reiterating the recommendation for acquittal of the 
accused, petitioner Borromeo.  Insofar as relevant, said manifestation 
reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The judgment of the trial court finding herein petitioner guilty 
of grave threat and which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals,
 was based mainly on the testimony of the complaining witness, Francisco
 Castillo.  During the trial of this case, the complaining witness 
manifested his unwillingness to prosecute the case, so that the 
prosecuting fiscal filed with the court a Motion to Dismiss.  The motion
 was, however, denied and trial proceeded, resulting in the judgment of 
conviction….. </p>
  <p> "Without the testimony of the complaining witness, there is 
absolutely nothing to support the charge of grave threats against 
petitioner.  Considering that this witness was threatened with possible 
prosecution for perjury if he backed out in his complaint against 
petitioner, he be­came an unwilling witness against the latter at the 
trial.  When petitioner was found guilty of the charge, and the case 
elevated to the Court of Appeals by petitioner, the complaining witness 
suffered heavily from severe remorse of conscience, prompting him to 
execute an affidavit of retraction absolving petitioner of any 
culpability of the crime imputed to him.  This affidavit of retraction 
was presented by petitioner to the Court of Appeals in support of his 
Ex-Parte Motion for Re-hearing/Reconsideration.  The Court of Appeals, 
however, gave no credit to complaining witness' affidavit of retraction,
 and denied petitioner's Ex-Parte Motion for Re-hearing/Reconsideration.
 </p>
  <p> "When this case was pending appeal before the Court of Appeals, we
 realized the insufficiency of the prosecution evidence to sustain the 
finding of guilt by the trial court.  Because of this, we recommended 
petitioner's acquittal (pp. 12 &amp; 13, People's Brief).  However, the 
Court of Appeals did not give due course to our recommendation and 
affirmed the judgment of conviction by the trial court. </p>
  <p> "In his struggle to clear his name and vindicate himself, 
petitioner came to this Honorable Court via his Petition for Review.  
His petition, initially denied by the Honorable Court for lack of merit,
 petitioner did not lose heart.  He pursued his case before this 
Honorable Court with relentless vigor and persistence. </p>
  <p> "After a series of reverses due to the denial by this Honorable 
Court of his Petition for Review and the Motions for Reconsideration 
filed thru his counsel, and the motion personally filed by him for a 
reconsideration of the resolution of this Honorable Court denying his 
Petition for Review ….. complaining witness came to his rescue and 
pleaded with this Honorable Court that petitioner be granted a new trial
 and/or hearing.  He also requested that he be directed to appear before
 this Honorable Court where he could testify ….. This Honorable Court 
imbued with compassion and a high sense of fairness and justice, gave 
due course to complaining witness' plea ….. </p>
  <p> "In the hearing sought by complaining witness, both petitioner and
 complaining witness appeared and they were examined by this Honorable 
Court.  Complaining witness informed this Honorable Court that he 
retracted his former affidavit and testimony implicating petitioner 
because he was an unwilling witness in the prosecution of the case 
against petitioner, and that the case against petitioner was engineered 
by his (complaining witness') brother-in-law.  Warned by Mr. Chief 
Justice Castro, ….. that he is liable to be prosecuted for perjury 
because of his retraction, complaining witness stood obstinate and firm 
in his declaration of petitioner's complete innocence of the charge.  
The only material piece of evidence linking petitioner to the charge 
having been removed because of complaining witness' retraction, the case
 against petitioner has no leg to stand on. </p>
  <p> "With the foregoing, the conclusion is inevitable that the guilt 
of petitioner of the crime charged has not been proved beyond reasonable
 doubt.  We, therefore, reiterate once more our recommendation for his 
acquittal."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We agree.
</p><p>
It may also be pointed that the trial court's finding or conclusion 
regarding the inculpatory fact was arrived at by surmise or conjecture. 
 This is readily seen from that portion of the appealed decision which 
says: "It is <em>possible</em> that … when his beloved was reprimanded by her brother … he [petitioner] <em>could not</em> control his temper and <em>using his revolver</em> he <em>threatened</em>
 the offended party with it." That does not jibe with common sense and 
experience.  The most probable and natural reaction of a suitor, who 
finds himself in such predicament, would be to ignore the provocative 
utterance of the younger brother of his sweetheart or constant 
companion.  It was, after all, a confrontation between brother and 
sister.  It bears emphasis that factual findings or conclusions of the 
appellate court are not conclusive on this Court if shown to be the 
result of speculation, surmise or conjecture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
Evidence to be believed "must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but <em>must be credible in itself </em>such as the<em> common experience </em>and<em> observation of mankind</em> can approve as probable under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  It is not so in the case at bar, not only in view of what was just 
noted but also because, the complainant having testified that prior to 
the incident he harbored no ill feelings towards and was in fact in good
 terms with the petitioner,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  there was no reason for the latter (a policeman) to use a gun to 
threaten the former, a young man who was unarmed.  The prosecution's 
evidence is not indubitable; it does not deserve the credence given to 
it by the trial court and the appellate court.
</p><p>
Finally, every circumstance against guilt and in favor of innocence must
 be taken into account and suspicion no matter how strong should not 
sway judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  Where the 
evidence, as here, gives rise to two probabilities, one consistent with 
the defend­ant's innocence and another indicative of his guilt, that 
which is favorable to the accused should be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  The constitutional presumption of innocence continues until overthrown
 by proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which requires moral 
certainty which convinces and satisfies the reason and conscience of 
those who are to act upon it.
</p><p>
All things considered, we find the evidence for the prosecution 
insufficient to establish petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the decision of the defunct Court of Appeals and the judgment
 a quo convicting the petitioner are hereby reversed, and another one of
 acquittal shall be entered in this case.  Costs <em>de oficio</em>.
SO ORDERED.
