patents against the private respondents and prayed that all the free patent
titles issued in their favor for properties over <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The Director of Lands, who was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as a formal defendant, filed his answer alleging,
among others, that the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">has

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1980</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered a decision dismissing the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that since the disputed properties
form part of disposable land of the public domain, the action for reversion should
be instituted by the Solicitor General in the name of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and that, therefore, the petitioner lacks personality to institute the
annulment proceedings.</p>

the mining patents </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">issued in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1962 conveyed to petitioner was only the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner has been
beguiling, less than <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">c</span>andid, and

petition is there any mention of a date before <st1:date year="1935" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1935</st1:date> as to when essential acts regarding its
mining claims were executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
silent as to when the land was entered, measured, and plotted; when the legal
pests and notices were put up; when the claim was registered with the mining
recorder; whether or not the <u>annual</u> amount of labor or development; and
other requirements under the Philippine Bill of 1902 were followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These may have been complied with but not
necessarily before 1935.</p>

<p class="BODY">A mere mention in the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title that
the provisions of the Philippine Bill of 1902 were followed is not
sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine Bill provides
the procedures for the perfection of mining claims but not the dates when such
procedures were undertaken by any prospector <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">or </span>claimant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same
procedures would have to be followed even after the Jones Law of 1916 and the
Constitution of 1935 were promulgated, but subject to the restrictions of the
fundamental law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner has
failed to state if and when new procedures, different from the 1902 procedures,
were provided by law to give a little substance to its case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner is completely and strangely
silent about these vital aspects of its petition.</p>

that petitioner offers as evidence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">its

of proof that the petitioner's claims were perfected prior to the 1935

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Article XIII, Section 1
of the 1935 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Constitution </span>provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All agricultural, timber, and mineral lands of the public
domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces
of potential energy, and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the State, and their disposition, exploitation,
development, or utilization shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or
to corporations or associations at least sixty <u>per <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

capital of which is owned by such citizens, subject to any existing right,
grant, lease, or concession at the time of the inauguration of the Government
established under this Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Natural
resources, with the exception of public agricultural land, shall not be
alienated</u> and no license, concession, or lease for the exploitation,
development, or utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted
for a period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for another twenty-five
years, except </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to water rights for irrigation, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">water </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

be the measure and the limit of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">grant." (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, applying the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision to the case at bar, we conclude that the issuance of the lode patents
on mineral claims by the President of the Philippines in 1962 in favor of the
petitioner granted to it only the right to extract or utilize the minerals
which may be found on or under the surface of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the issuance of the free
patents by the respondent Director of Lands in 1979 in favor of the private
respondents granted to them the ownership and the right to use the land for
agricultural purposes but excluding the ownership of, and the right to extract
or utilize, the minerals which may be found on or under the surface.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no basis in the records for the petitioner's stand that
it acquired the right to the mineral lands prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the 1935 Constitution, thus, making such acquisition outside its purview and
scope.</p>

<p class="BODY">Every application for a concession of public land has to be
viewed in the light of its peculiar circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Director of Lands v. <span class="SpellE">Funtilar</span>,
142 SCRA 57, 69).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, although the original certificates of titles
of the petitioner were issued prior to the titles of the private respondents,
the former cannot prevail over the latter for the provisions of the
Constitution which governed at the time of their issuance prohibited the
alienation of mineral lands of the public domain.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>Republic v. Animas</u> (56 SCRA 499), this
Court ruled that a grantee does not become the owner of a land illegally
included in the grant just because title has been issued in his favor:</p>

<blockquote>"A patent is void at law if the officer who issued the patent
had no authority to do so (Knight v. Land Ass., 142 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
161, 12 Sup. <st1:state><st1:place>Ct.</st1:place></st1:state>, 258, 35L ED.
974; italics supplied).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If a person
obtains a title under the Public Land Act which includes, by mistake or
oversight, lands which cannot be registered under the Torrens System, or when
the Director of lands did not have jurisdiction over the same because it is a
public forest, the grantee does not, by virtue of said certificate of title
alone, become the owner of the land illegally included.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> v. <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename></st1:place>, 49 Phil. 769)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, patents and land grants are construed favorably in
favor of the Government, and most strongly against the grantee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any doubt as to the intention or extent of
the grant, or the intention of the Government, is to be resolved in its
favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">See</span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Republic</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE"> v.
Court of Appeals, 73 SCRA 146, 156).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, as earlier stated, in the absence of proof that the petitioner
