from a judgment of the former Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>First
Instance of Basilan City, which con­victed Leonardo de los Santos of the crime
of Murder and sentenced him to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <u>perpetua</u>, </span>to indemnify the
heirs of the victim in the amount of P12,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment
in case of insolvency and to pay proportionate costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Leonardo de los Santos and Alfredo Lacastesantos <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">were </span>charged with the crime of Murder
in an Information which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 29th day of November 1971, and within
the juris­diction of this Honorable Court, viz., at Tairan, Isabela, City of
Basilan, Philippines, the above named accused, armed with a bolo and a knife,
conspir­ing and confederating together, aiding and assisting one another, and
with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlaw­fully
and feloniously, assault, attack and hack one Gregorio Dotado, thereby <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">inflicting hack wounds upon the body </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">said Gregorio Dotado, which caused his
death.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law." (p. 5, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On January 31, 1972, </span>only
appellant was arraigned and he pleaded not guilty to the charge (p. 13,
Original Records).  Trials were
conducted and on May 24, 1972, appellant, as already stated, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>convicted.  It was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only
on August 16, 1972 </span>that the other accused, Alfredo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lacastesantos, was arraigned and </span>he
pleaded not guilty (p. 68, Original Records).  On even date, Prosecuting Fiscal Laurencio E. Saavedra orally moved for
the dis­missal of the case against Lacastesantos for the reason that the
prosecution is bereft of evidence sufficient to convict <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Lacastesantos. The trial court dismissed </span>the case against
Lacastesantos for the reason that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">although
appellant Leonardo de los Santos was con­victed, his conviction was due to his
extrajudicial confession and that Lacastesantos was merely implicated by the
appellant as one of the participants of the crime (p. 69, Original Records).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The pertinent facts that
gave rise to the instant prosecution are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the early morning of </span>November
30, 1971, a certain Gregorio Dotado was found dead by his sister at the junction
of a trail leading to his house at Tairan, Isabela, Basilan City.  Francisco Dotado, the father of the
deceased, upon being informed, reported the matter to the manager of Tairan
Plantation who notified the police authorities.  There was no eye­witness to the commission of the crime.  The police authorities immediately began the
investigation of the case.  Patrolman
Conrado D. Francisco of the Basilan Police Department learned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that prior to his death, the </span>victim
Gregorio Dotado was courting a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">certain
Herminia </span>Garcia <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>he
had a rival by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>name of
Leonardo de los Santos, appellant herein.  On December 6, 1971, at around 5:30 p.m., appellant was picked up for
ques­tioning by the police authorities of Basilan City.  The following day, appellant voluntarily
executed an affidavit wherein he confessed to his participation in the killing
of the deceased.  The said affidavit was
sworn to by appellant before Clerk of Court Ruben Ramos of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">City </span>Court of Basilan.  The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">affidavit

  -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
November 29, 1971, at about 7:00 p.m., Alfredo Lacastesantos and myself went to
the house of Manuel Martinez, at Tairan Camp, Isabela, this City, pur­portedly
to drink tuba.  Thereat, I saw Sebastian
Ambrosio, Romeo Martinez, Pablito Santos, Alberto Meneng and the late Gre­gorio
Dotado.  The five were drinking tuba,
right in the balcony of the said house.  There, we stayed by the staircase.  And not long after, Al­berto Meneng and the late Gre­gorio Dotado went
downstairs and they headed toward the house of said Meneng at a nearby dis­tance.  Immediately then Alfredo Lacastesantos and
myself went after Gregorio Dotado, who was on his way home outside of the
boundary of the Tairan Planta­tion.  We
were able then to catch up Gregorio Dotado, who was almost to reach his
house.  There and then I asked him in
chavacano dialect, in this manner:  'VOLVE YA BOS?’ and with a bolo hacked the said Dotado on the throat,
once.  And when he fell on the ground I
again hacked him on the forehead, once.  After that I turned his body to a prostrated position, because he was
facing upward when he fell and there and then too, Alfredo Lacastesantos with a
knife slashed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>neck of said
Gregorio Dotado.  There­after, sensing
that Gregorio Dotado was already dead, we ran away home to Subaan Tairan,
Isabela, this City; and yesterday afternoon (December 6, 1971) I was picked up
by the Police for investigation in connection with the said kill<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">ing.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">9, </span>1971,
appellant executed an affidavit repudiating his extrajudicial confession.  The lower court, however, ruled that the
extrajudicial confession of appellant was freely and voluntarily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">executed and appellant was found guilty of
the crime charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In seeking the reversal
of the decision rendered against him, appellant herein raised the sole issue
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in having
convicted defendant-appellant solely on the strength of Exhibit ‘D’ the alleged
confession when the same was obtained thru violence, threat and intimidation
and when the contents thereof were belied by the very evidence of the pro<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">secution." (Brief of
Defendant-Appellant, p. 47, Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant
maintains that his confession Exhibit "D" is inadmissible for having
been obtained thru violence, threat and intimidation.  He avers that in the evening of December 6, 1971, after Pat.
Conrado Francisco had brought him to the police station for questioning, two
men from the Detective Department investigated him; that when he denied any
participation in the killing of the deceased, the two men boxed him, hit­ting
him in the left eyebrow and in the mouth and they also kicked the left side of
his body while he was in a squatting position; that when he was brought before
the Clerk of Court of the City Court of Basilan on December 7, 1971 to
subscribe under oath his confes­sion, he signed Exhibit "D" because
of threat made by the policeman who escorted him that he will again be
maltreated if he refuses to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is significant to
consider that Exhibit "D" was taken on December 7, 1971 by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Pat. </span>Conrado Francisco <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">while the alleged maltreatment was done in
the evening of December 6, 1971.  It is
unbelievable that the alleged maltreatment made by the two policemen was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">what </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">induced appellant to admit the crime the follow</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ing day.  Ordinarily, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">confessions
executed through intimidation or maltreatment are obtained during or
immediately after the supposed maltreatment.  In the instant case, appellant alleges that in spite of the alleged
manhandling, he never admitted anything that evening and the two policemen
desisted from further harming him.  However, when investigated the following day (December 7, 1971) by
police detective Conrado Francisco, appellant readily confessed his participa­tion
in the killing of Gregorio Dotado.  In
fact, during the cross-examination, appellant expressly acknowledged that Pat.
Francisco neither maltreated nor intimidated him during the investigation.  Appel­lant testified thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q When Conrado Francisco in­vestigated
you did he mal­treat you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A  No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q Did Conrado Francisco inti­midate
you while he was investigating you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q Did he tie you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. In other words Conrado
Francisco simply conducted a very regular investigation without touching your
body?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A Yes, sir." (pp. 308-309,
tsn).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Even
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Ruben </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Ramos, the Clerk of Court of the City Court
of Basilan, testified that when the confession </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was sworn </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to before him
by the appellant on December 7, </span>1971, the latter did not complain that
he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">mal</span>treated and instead
admitted that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">statements in </span>Exhibit
"D" were voluntarily given and signed by appel­lant.  Ramos testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
the Contents of Exhibit 'D’ was interpreted to the affiant Leonardo de los
Santos y Sagdi, did he inform you that he refused to sign this statement?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
as a matter of fact I asked him a question whether he was willing to sign it
and I investigated him whether he was coerced or intimidated and he said, no,
he was willing to sign." (p. 120, tsn).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you ask Leonardo de los Santos whether the statement that he gave appearing on
Ex­hibit 'D' was only forced or vexed from him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
asked that question, he said he gave that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">voluntarily.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Did </span>he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">complain </span>to you that he was maltreated to give this statement?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir." (pp. 121-122, tsn).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A confession is deemed to have been made volun­tarily if the
accused did no complain to the proper authorities regarding the alleged
maltreatment despite the opportunity to do so (People vs. Page, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">77 </span>SCRA 348).  If appellant's confession as contained in
Exhibit "D" was voluntary, we have to conclude that Dotado was slain
in the manner and for the reason set out in that document.  It is needless <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to </span>say that no one in his right mind would c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">onvict </span>himself with­out compulsion by
fabricating a highly self-damaging story and suppressing the truth which would
absolve him (People vs. Carillo, 77 Phil. 572).</p>

<p class="BODY">Another factor that militates against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">the </span>claim of appellant of involuntariness in the execution of
Exhibit "D" is the fact that the confession is re­plete with details
that only the confessant could have known.  Appellant narrated in his confession that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">at </span>about 7:00 p.m. on November 29, 1971, the victim was then
drinking <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tuba</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">the </span>house of Manuel Martinez together with Sebastian Ambrosio,
Romeo Martinez, Pablito Santos and Alberto Meneng; that when the victim left
the house of Martinez, he and Alfredo Lacastesantos followed the former; that
before the victim reached his house, they overtook him; where­upon appellant
hacked him with a bolo, first on the throat and when the victim fell on the
ground, he again hacked him on the forehead and realizing that the victim was
already dead, they ran away.  The
post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased conducted by Sanitary
Inspector Hilario Guerrero showed that the wounds sustained by the victim were
located exactly in the places where appellant in his affidavit stated that he
inflicted them upon the victim, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"1. Hacked wound, extensive, multiple, neck, almost severed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2. Hacked wound, eyebrow,
bila<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">teral.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Cause of Death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Due to multiple hacked wounds." (Exhibit A, p. 1, Original
Exhibit)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Indeed, the confession at bar being
complete with details that only the appellant could have known, therefore, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">show that the confession was executed
voluntarily (People vs. Jimenez, 105 SCRA 721).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Considering the foregoing
circumstances, this Court is of the view that appellant's admission volun­tarily
made and confirmed by him in open court during his trial, renders worthless the
challenge now inter­posed by him to the admissibility of his sworn state­ment,
Exhibit "D".  It is
significant to note that the extrajudicial confession, Exhibit “D”, was
obtained and offered in evidence before the 1973 Constitution took effect.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fact, the decision appealed from
was ren­dered by the trial court on May 24, 1972.  Consequently, appellant's extrajudicial confession, Exhibit
"D", is admissible in evidence although the requisites in Section 20
of of Article IV of the 1973 Constitution which declares inadmissible a
confession obtained from a person under investigation for an offense who has
not been informed of his right to remain silent and to counsel were not
observed, since that portion of the 1973 constitutional mandate should be given
prospective and not retrospective effect and no law gave the accused the right
to be so informed before the effectivity of </span>the 1973 Constitution
(Magtoto vs. Manguera, 63 SCRA 4).  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Furthermore, the declaration of an accused
expressly acknowledging his guilt of the offense charged, may be given in
evidence against him (Sec. 29, Rule 130).  It has been held that a confession constitutes evidence of high order
and the presumption is that no sane person would deliberately </span>confess
the commission of a crime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unless
prompted to do so </span>by truth and conscience (U.S. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">vs. De los Santos, 24 Phil. 329).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant likewise
impugns the truth </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">confessions as regards the house </span>where
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the deceased was last seen.  Appellant alleges that according to the
affidavit of Alberto (Roberto) Meneng which was attached to the information
filed by </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prosecuting fiscal,
Meneng was the companion of the deceased in the evening of November 29, 1971
when they went to the </span>house <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of <u>Salvador</u>
<u>Martinez</u> to drink <u>tuba</u> (p. 4, Original Record).  </span>While <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>the confession, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it
was stated that the deceased just before </span>his death <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was in the house of one <u>Manuel</u> <u>Martinez</u>.  This argument deserves scant consideration
not only because of its immateriality </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">but </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">also because the
supposed witness Alberto (Roberto) Meneng was never </span>presented <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">during the trial as witness either for the

evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant's extrajudicial
confession was corro­borated by the evidence on the <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u>,
