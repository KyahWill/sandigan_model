<p>The conviction of Reynaldo Palen for the crime of Double Murder and 
Frustrated Murder is before us for review.&nbsp; The case arose from an ambush which 
took place in North Cotabato, wherein two people were killed and one was 
wounded.<br><br>At about 11:30 o'clock in the morning of June 5, 1982, 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan member Deogracias Genota, his bodyguard Gaspar Mora and 
another companion, Agustin Epil, were on their way to the Poblacion of Makilala, 
North Cotabato, on board a Toyota Tamaraw jeep when they were ambushed by armed 
men at Barangay Upper Malasila, Makilala, North Cotabato.&nbsp; Deogracias Genota, 
who was driving the vehicle, and Agustin Epil, who was seated beside him, were 
fatally hit upon the initial burst of gunfire and died almost instantaneously.&nbsp; 
Gaspar Mora, who was seated on the right side of Agustin Epil, was not fatally 
wounded, and he immediately lay flat, face down, on the floor of the vehicle.&nbsp; 
He was able to get his armalite rifle and to return the fire.&nbsp; He managed later 
to get out of the vehicle and tried to seek cover behind it, but he was hit by a 
bullet on the shoulder, as a result of which he dropped his armalite.&nbsp; He then 
jumped to a lower portion of the ground and was able to get away, crawling and 
at times walking, to a distance of around 400 meters from the ambush site.&nbsp; He 
sustained seven gunshot wounds and was brought to St. Joseph Hospital where he 
was confined and treated for more than two months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On June 11, 1982, at about 3:00 
p.m., acting on the information given by Salvador Revelle, a group of PC 
soldiers and CHDF men headed by Lt. Winston Ebersole, riding in the jeep of 
Ining Genota, brother of the deceased, Deogracias Genota, went to Barangay 
Malasila, Makilala, and arrested the accused Reynaldo Palen together with his 
father, Fernando Palen, Angel Maglangit, Alfredo Maglangit and Bernabe Ali, all 
of whom were at the store of said Fernando Palen at that time.&nbsp; They were 
hogtied, except for the father of Reynaldo Palen, and brought to the old PC 
Barracks at Kidapawan, North Cotabato.&nbsp; The apprehension was done without the 
benefit of a warrant of arrest.&nbsp; Subsequently, all were released, except 
Reynaldo Palen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The sworn 
statement of Salvador Revelle was taken by Sgt. Renato Torralba on that day, 
June 11, 1982, at 2:00 p.m. at the PC Barracks at Kidapawan, in the course of 
which the declarant was shown the person of Reynaldo Palen and was asked to 
identify him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Earlier, on June 
10, 1982, Sgt. Torralba investigated and took down the written statement of 
Zosimo Pre, a farmer residing in Barangay Upper Malasila, who declared that on 
June 5, 1982, a group of armed men headed by a woman by the name of 
<em>alias</em> "Lucy" passed by his farm; they were coming down the trail from 
Barangay Buena Vida and heading in the direction of the Makilala river towards 
Barangay Tubon, and he believed they were the persons who ambushed Deo 
Genota.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>A complaint was filed 
against the accused Reynaldo Palen, <em>alias</em> "Lucy", and several John Does 
for Double Murder and Frustrated Murder by Lt. Winston Ebersole on June 11, 1982 
and sworn to before Municipal Judge Elena B. de Leon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On June 17, 1982, the Municipal 
Mayor of Makilala, North Cotabato, examined and took down in writing the 
statements of Salvador Revelle<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and 
Zosimo Pre.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On the same day, he issued 
a warrant of arrest against Reynaldo Palen and Alias Lucy; no bail was 
recommended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The return of the 
warrant, dated June 23, 1982, and signed by Sgt. Renato Torralba, stated that 
only Reynaldo Palen was arrested.&nbsp; A commitment order was issued by Municipal 
Judge Elena de leon on June 23, 1982, committing Reynaldo Palen to the custody 
of the PC Provincial Commander at Kidapawan, North Cotabato.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On November 25, 1982, an 
Information was filed by the Provincial Fiscal of North Cotabato against 
Reynaldo Palen, <em>alias</em> "Lucy", and several unidentified persons named 
therein as Henry Doe, Peter Doe and Charlie Doe, for "Double Murder and 
Frustrated Murder", committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about June 5, 1982, at Barangay Upper Malasila, Municipality of 
Makilala, Province of North Cotabato, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of 
this Honorable Court, accused Reynaldo Palen <em>alias</em> Lucy, Henry Doe, 
Peter Doe, Charlie Doe and several others whose real identities are not yet 
known, armed with high powered firearms of different calibers, with intent to 
kill, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, with 
treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously, attack, assault and fire at the service jeep of Provincial Board 
Member Deogracias Genota, Agustin Epil and Gaspar Mora, thereby hitting and 
inflicting on Board Member Deogracias Genota and Agustin Epil mortal gun shot 
wounds on the vital parts of their bodies which caused their death; and on the 
same occasion, thereby hitting Gaspar Mora serious gunshot wounds on the vital 
parts of the body which would have produced the crime of Murder, as a 
consequence, but nevertheless, did not produce it by reason or causes 
independent of the will of the perpetrators, that is, by the timely and able 
medical assistance rendered to said victim which prevented his 
death."</p></blockquote>
<p>CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Reynaldo 
Palen, the only accused who was arrested, was arraigned on December 13, 1982 and 
pleaded not guilty.<br><br>After trial, the Regional Trial Court, 12th Judicial 
Region, Branch XVII, rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, and in view of all the foregoing considerations, the Court find 
the accused, Reynaldo Palen, <em>alias</em> Lucy, guilty beyond reasonable doubt 
of the offense of double murder with frustrated murder and with the application 
of the Indeterminate Sentence Law with respect to frustrated murder only, hereby 
sentences the accused to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> for each of the offenses of 
double murder and an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and twenty (20) 
days of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, fourteen (14) years, ten (10) months 
and twenty (20) days of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum, to be served 
successively in accordance with the provisions of Art. 70 of the Revised Penal 
Code, as amended, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased victim, Deogracias 
V. Genota, in the amount of P12,000.00, and the heirs of the other deceased 
victim, Agustin Epil, the amount of P12,000.00, to indemnify Gaspar Mora the 
amount of P192.00 as actual expenses incurred as a result of the injuries he 
sustained; and to pay the costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>SO ORDERED."<br><br>Appealing the decision to this Court, Reynaldo Palen 
seeks the reversal of his conviction, assigning several errors commited by the 
court <em>a quo</em>, which in brief, may be summed up as follows:&nbsp; (1) that the 
trial court erred in giving credence to the testimony of the prosecution witness 
Salvador Revelle; and (2) the Court erred in not giving credence to appellant's 
alibi.<br><br>The testimony of Salvador Revelle in this case is vital.&nbsp; He is 
the only witness whose testimony links the accused Reynaldo Palen to the crime.&nbsp; 
The sole survivor of the ambush, Gaspar Mora, who before he escaped to safety 
fired at the ambushers, could not identify any of them; he said he could not 
clearly see the ambushers because of the "cover crops" and the rubber trees.&nbsp; 
According to Mora, the ambushers occupied an elevated place, planted with cover 
crops; they were on the side of a bank and were concealed behind the cover 
crops.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Gaspar Mora knew Reynaldo 
Palen personally,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> hence, he could 
have easily identified him had he seen him among the ambushers.<br><br>Since the 
whole case for the prosecution turns on the sole, uncorroborated testimony of 
Revelle, it is important that his testimony should be subjected to a careful and 
close scrutiny.<br><br>The trial court, in its decision, summarized the 
testimony of Revelle, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first witness of the prosecution is Salvador Revelle, (<em>sic</em>).&nbsp; 
He testified that he is residing at Upper Malasila, Makilala, North Cotabato, 
working on the land of Francisco Bago which is situated at Upper Malasila going 
to Nueva (<em>sic</em>) Vida, Makilala, North Cotabato.&nbsp; On June 5, 1982 at 
11:30 in the morning, he was in his house at Upper Malasila, Makilala, North 
Cotabato cooking rice.&nbsp; His companions were Dodong and Ronald.&nbsp; He could not 
recall the name of the third companion.&nbsp; Those persons were residents of the 
National Highway but they ate their lunch there on June 5, 1982.&nbsp; They were 
weeding on the rubber plantation of Kibod which is near his house.. At that time 
and date, there was an unusual incident in his place.&nbsp; There were many firings 
on the upper direction of his house.&nbsp; He jumped to the ground and took cover 
behind a mango tree which is 15 meters away from his house.&nbsp; His companions also 
jumped from his house.&nbsp; While hiding, he saw Reynaldo Palen who was carrying a 
long gun which was estimated to be about 3 and ½ feet in length.&nbsp; He said he 
knows the accused Reynaldo Palen for more than a year ago.&nbsp; He resides on the 
upper portion of the place he was staying.&nbsp; He had no misunderstanding with 
Palen.&nbsp; Witness identified Palen in the courtroom.&nbsp; Palen was standing while 
firing his long gun to the air when witness saw him from a distance of about 50 
meters.&nbsp; Then he turned his back and went away … He knows that Deogracias Genota 
died on June 5, 1982.&nbsp; He saw the dead man who was killed during the ambush by 
Reynaldo Palen.&nbsp; He saw the dead body of Deogracias Genota on the upper 
direction of his house in the place where the incident happened.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Salvador Reville (<em>sic</em>) stated that he is 
presently residing in the old PC Barracks at the Provincial Commander's place, 
he said he was residing at the Old Barracks because he was taken to stay there 
pending this case.&nbsp; He was taken in his residence by Ballesteros to be brought 
to the Provincial Commander who told him that he would help him.&nbsp; He said that 
he was in the PC Barracks at 11:30 o'clock in the morning of June 11, 1982.&nbsp; 
Sgt. Torralba took his statement.&nbsp; He did not know Sgt. Torralba that time the 
latter investigated him but he introduced himself to him.&nbsp; He arrived at 9:00 
o'clock in the morning and gave his statement at 11:30 o'clock and it was 
finished a long time later.&nbsp; They were four during the investigation, namely:&nbsp; 
himself, Torralba, Subalde and Galeon.&nbsp; He had his statement read to him before 
he signed it.&nbsp; Reville (<em>sic</em>) said he was in his house cooking on June 
5, 1982.&nbsp; He was working in his house from 6:00 o'clock in the morning to 6:00 
o'clock in the evening.&nbsp; He heard gun fires at 11:30 o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; He 
immediately jumped out of his house and hid behind a mango tree.&nbsp; Then he saw 
Reynaldo Palen for he turned his back.&nbsp; He saw the ambush of Deogracias Genota 
because it was near.&nbsp; The distance between him and the place of ambush was 
estimated by Atty. Aranas as 30 meters while the Court and the Fiscal estimated 
the distance as 50 meters.&nbsp; The mango tree where he hid was 15 meters from his 
house.&nbsp; When he heard the first gunfire, he was cooking rice.&nbsp; On the second 
burst, he jumped and hid behind a mango tree.&nbsp; His house was five meters high.&nbsp; 
He was alone for his companions ran away.&nbsp; Gunfires still continued.&nbsp; He did not 
see where Deogracias Genota was because the ambush was below.&nbsp; He saw him later 
when there were already many soldiers in the place of ambush at 2:00 o'clock in 
the afternoon.&nbsp; From hiding, Reville (<em>sic</em>) went to the highway to look 
for his companions.&nbsp; The road between his house and the scene of the ambush was 
planted to rubber trees and bananas.&nbsp; He said he was scrubbing floor and cooking 
meals in the PC Barracks to survive and to eat.&nbsp; It was not a reward.&nbsp; He 
executed two sworn statements in connection with the case; one before the PC and 
another before the Municipal Mayor of Makilala.&nbsp; His companions during the 
preliminary investigation by the Mayor were Sgt. Torralba and Lt. Ebersole.&nbsp; He 
was already living in the PC Barracks that time.&nbsp; Witness did not recall how 
long did he make his statement before Sgt. Torralba."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear from the evidence adduced in this case that the ambushers were 
concealed behind cover crops on the side of a bank overlooking a winding road — 
an ideal site for an ambush.&nbsp; The place of ambush is of higher elevation than 
the house where Salvador Revelle was at the time the incident happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Said house is about 10 meters off the 
road and the mango tree where Revelle took cover is about 15 meters away from 
the back of the house and is on a lower level.&nbsp; From the house to the ambush 
site, the configuration of the land is "rolling and surrounded with rubber 
trees"; the road towards the place where the firing took place is not straight 
but has two curves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> These 
circumstances must be taken into account in evaluating the testimony of Salvador 
Revelle.&nbsp; Indeed, they indicate that the place where Revelle sought cover could 
not have afforded him a clear and direct view of the ambushers, unlike the place 
where Gaspar Mora was when he was fired at by the ambushers.<br><br>Summing up 
Salvador Revelle's testimony, the trial court says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Prosecution witness, Salvador Reville (<em>sic</em>), stated that while he 
was seeking cover behind a mango tree, he saw Reynaldo Palen standing with a 
"long and big gun".&nbsp; Palen fired his gun towards the air, turned his back and 
went away (TSN, 4/28/83, pp. 11-13)."</p></blockquote>
<p>In giving full credence to Revelle's testimony, the Court says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Salvador Reville's (<em>sic</em>) testimony is impeccable and rings true 
throughout.&nbsp; He said that he was preparing his lunch.&nbsp; When he heard the second 
burst of gunfire, he jumped from the kitchen alone, not knowing what his four 
visitors did, and sought cover behind a mango tree.&nbsp; Then he saw the accused 
Reynaldo Palen standing in the place where there were firings, fired his big, 
long gun to the air, turned his back and went away.&nbsp; Reville (<em>sic</em>) saw 
him in the latter part of the firings of the guns."</p></blockquote>
<p>The finding that "Palen fired his gun towards the air, turned his back and 
went away" is not supported by the evidence.&nbsp; The decision gives the impression 
that when Palen fired his gun into the air, he was facing the direction where 
Revelle was, because after firing the gun, he supposedly "turned his back and 
went away".&nbsp; However, in his sworn statement (Exh. B) taken during the 
preliminary examination by the Municipal Mayor on June 17, 1982, Salvador 
Revelle stated categorically that he saw Palen "standing with a firearm firing 
towards the road, <em>his back facing me</em>".&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied).&nbsp; He 
further said that Palen "looked back" so that he was able to recognize him.&nbsp; 
These statements, given by Revelle shortly after the incident, does not jibe 
with the finding of the trial court based on his testimony given about a year 
later on the witness stand, as summarized by the court in its decision.&nbsp; The 
prior statement of Revelle clearly shows that he could only have a fleeting 
glimpse of the face of the accused, and considering the distance (about 50 
meters) and the natural obstructions that obscured his view, such as the 
configuration of the terrain, the cover crops, the banana trees, the rubber 
trees, etc., we are not convinced with moral certainty that the identification 
of the accused by Revelle at that crucial moment can be relied upon, standing 
alone and uncorroborated, as the sole basis for the conviction of the 
accused.<br><br>It is inherently improbable that an ambusher would be standing 
up when firing at the ambushers.&nbsp; Gaspar Mora's version is more credible when he 
said that the ambushers were concealed behind the cover crops, that is why, he 
could not identify any of them.&nbsp; In fact, since he knew Palen and was right at 
the ambush site, he could have easily identified the latter if he were standing 
while firing, as claimed by Revelle.<br><br>The trial court also made the 
finding that Revelle "jumped from the kitchen alone, not knowing what his four 
visitors did, and sought cover behind a mango tree".&nbsp; This point was the subject 
of conflicting evidence.&nbsp; In fact, Revelle himself contradicted this when he 
testified that "his companions also jumped from the house".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Tomas Alismo, who was with Revelle at the 
time of the incident and who testified for the defense, stated that he and his 
other companions, Valentin Nunez and two other persons, jumped from the kitchen 
together with Revelle and hid behind the mango tree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Therefore, it cannot be said that Revelle 
was alone in jumping from the house and seeking cover behind the mango tree.&nbsp; He 
was with some companions hiding behind the mango tree, two of whom testified for 
the defense and said they did not see the accused at the ambush site.<br><br>The 
trial court did not attach any weight to the testimony of the two defense 
witnesses, Alismo and Nunez, saying that their story was incredible and 
exaggerated since "it is hardly consistent with truth to say that the two 
witnesses, their two companions and Salvador Reville ran together to the room, 
then to the kitchen and jumped to the ground and together sought cover behind a 
mango tree nearby." We see nothing "incredible" or "exaggerated" in the 
testimony.&nbsp; These witnesses were at the balcony of the house when they heard the 
sudden burst of gunfire.&nbsp; What is more natural than for them, upon hearing the 
gunfire, to run together inside the house towards the kitchen at the back and 
from there, jump down and run to the mango tree to seek cover?<br><br>We find 
the trial court's statement that the testimony of Revelle "is impeccable and 
rings true throughout" to be unjustified and rather too extravagant.&nbsp; Apart from 
what has already been discussed above, there are other indications in the record 
which throw doubt on the rather lavish assessment of Revelle's testimony by the 
court <em>a quo</em>.&nbsp; On record are instances which show Revelle to be 
hesitating, watching for a cue from the prosecutor or refusing to answer 
questions, prompting defense counsel to object to the prosecutor making "body 
language to the witness" or to put on record the witness' refusal to answer 
questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Revelle also showed lack 
of candor when he denied having seen the accused Palen at the PC Headquarters at 
Kidapawan, North Cotabato on June 11, 1982 at the time his statement (Exhibit A) 
was taken,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> when as a matter of fact, 
the statement itself shows that Palen was presented to him for 
identification.<br><br>The accused Reynaldo Palen is charged in the information 
with having an <em>alias</em>, "Lucy", but there is nothing in the evidence, 
whether testimonial or documentary, which show that he is known by such an 
<em>alias</em>.&nbsp; An attempt to tamper with the record by changing "Lucy" to 
"Reyne" was foiled when defense counsel discovered the change, and upon his 
motion, the trial court issued an order declaring the change unauthorized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Indeed, the name "<em>alias</em> Lucy" 
appears in the record, but it refers to a lady allegedly heading a group of 
armed men seen on the day of the ambush by a farmer, Zosimo Pre,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> who was never presented in 
court.<br><br>Upon careful review of the record, we cannot in conscience sustain 
the conviction of the accused which is based on the sole, uncorroborated 
testimony of prosecution witness, Salvador Revelle.&nbsp; We find the evidence 
insufficient to warrant finding Reynaldo Palen guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
the crime charged.&nbsp; Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary to pass 
upon the defense of alibi put up by the accused.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed 
decision is hereby reversed and the accused acquitted of the offenses charged.&nbsp;
