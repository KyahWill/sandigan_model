preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Minister (now Secretary) of
Natural Resources and the Director of Mines from enforcing Presidential Decree
No. 1214 dated October 14, 1977 requiring all locators under the Act of
Congress of July 1, 1902, as amended, to apply for mining lease contracts under
the provision of Presidential Decree No. 463 better known as the Mineral
Development Resources Decree of 1974 and to declare Presidential Decree No.
1214 unconstitutional since its enforcement would deprive petitioners of its
property without due process and without just compensation.</p>

mineral claims which it acquired through purchase in good faith and for value
43 years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said claims situated at
the Municipality of Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, were located

the Philippine Bill of 1902).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Petition,
p. 2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 3); that from 1934 to 1977 it has to
its credit a total investment of over P1,222,640.00 for the mining exploration,
development and operation of its said sixty mining claims (Petition, p. 3; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 4); that on June 14, 1977 it actually and duly
filed its application for patent for each claim of said sixty (60) mineral
claims (Petition, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 5); that respondent
Director of Mines issued an order dated July 13, 1977 approving the application
of petitioner for <span class="SpellE">availment</span> of rights on said claims
under Presidential Decree No. 463 (Petition, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 6); that the aforesaid sixty (60) lode mineral claims are already private
property of petitioner, following the doctrinal rule laid down in McDaniel v. <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cuisia</span> (42 Phil.

Act of U.S. Congress of July 1, 1902, as amended, already segregated from the

was adopted by <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> as to the factual and
legal showing of the unconstitutionality of Presidential Decree No. 1214 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 455-456).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Solicitor General as
counsel for public respondent submitted his memorandum on February 12, 1982 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 468-­499) while petitioner filed its reply to
said memorandum on April 3, 1982 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
505-560).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for petitioner on August 20, 1982 filed a motion to refer
this case to the Court En Banc for action and decision (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 536) and on September 8, 1982, the Court resolved to issue a temporary
restraining order, effective as of said date and continuing until otherwise
ordered by the Court (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 562).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 11, 1988 the Court acting on the motion for
intervention filed by counsel for <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Francisco N. <span class="SpellE">Calinisan</span> dated January 6, 1988, and
considering that this case has long been submitted for decision, resolved to
deny the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">aforesaid motion for having
been filed late (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 597).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue raised by the petitioner and by the erstwhile
<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>whether or not under the provision of P.D. No. 1214 there was
deprivation of property without due process of law and just compensation which
makes <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">said </span>decree
unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their contention that a perfected and valid appropriation of
public mineral lands operates as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>withdrawal
of the tract of land from the public domain and is deemed to be already private
<span class="GramE">property,</span> is without basis in fact and in law
(Comment, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61).</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue has been resolved in a recent decision of this Court
in Sta. Rosa Mining Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Leido</span>, Jr. (156 SCRA
1 [1987]) where it was held that while rulings in McDaniel v. <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span> (42 Phil. 749 [1922]) and Gold Creek Mining Corp.
v. Rodriguez (66 Phil. 259 [1938]) cited by the petitioner, true enough,
recognize the right of a locator of a mining claim as a property right; such
right is not absolute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is merely a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> right more so if petitioner's claims <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">are </span>still unpatented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It can be lost through abandonment or
forfeiture or they may be revoked on valid legal grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no showing that petitioner has
complied with all the terms and conditions prescribed by law prior to November
15, 1935; that there should be not only a valid and subsisting location of the
mineral land but that there should be, thereafter, continuous compliance with
all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">requirements of law such as the
performance of annual assessment works and payment of real estate taxes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, petitioner filed its application
only in 1977 for a patent, or 43 years after it allegedly located and
registered the mining claims (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 63).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As to the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>issue of constitutionality, the Court
categorically stated that P.D. No. 1214 is constitutional. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>valid exercise of the sovereign power of the State, as owner, over lands
of the public domain, of which petitioner's mining claims still form a part,
and over the patrimony of the nation, of which mineral deposits are a valuable
asset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be underscored, in this
connection, that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Decree </span>does
not cover all mining claims located under the Phil. Bill of 1902, but only
those claims over which their locators had failed to obtain a patent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even then, such locators may still avail
of the renewable twenty-five year (25) lease prescribed by Pres. Decree No.
463, the Mineral Development Resources Decree of 1974.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mere location does not mean absolute ownership over the
affected land or the mining claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
merely segregates the located land or area from the public domain by barring
other would-be locators from locating the same and appropriating for themselves
the minerals found therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To rule
otherwise would imply that location is all that is needed to acquire and
maintain rights over a located mining claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This, we cannot approve or sanction because it is contrary to the
intention of the lawmaker that the locator should faithfully and consistently
comply with the requirements for annual work and improvements in the located
mining claim." (Santa Rosa Mining Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Leido</span>,
Jr., <u>supra</u>, pp. 8-9)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">P.D. No. 1214 is in
accord with Section 8, Article XIV of </span>the 1973 Constitution and
presently in Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution where the same
constitutional mandate is restated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 2, 1988, the Court granted a motion filed by counsel for
petitioner dated May 20, 1988 to admit a manifestation and motion wherein
petitioner prayed that the "Court allow the petitioner to change the
original prayer in its petition dated October 10, 1978 with a new prayer
