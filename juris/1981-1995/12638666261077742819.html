of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Fifth Judicial District, Branch VI, <st1:city><st1:place>San

Diaz was charged with the crime of Falsification of Official Document committed
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“That on or about the <span style="">5th
day of </span>December 1972, in the Municipality of San Fernando, Province of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction <span style="">of this </span>Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, REOLANDI M. DIAZ, then a Senior Clerk at the Jose <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos High School <span style="">and, </span>therefore, a public employee, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously commit falsification of official documents, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by executing and filing in the
office of the Civil Service Commission of said municipality a Personal Data
Sheet, CS Form No. 212(65), an official document, stating and making it appear
therein that he was a fourth year Bachelor of Arts student in 1950-54 at the
Cosmopolitan and <span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span> Colleges which document
is a requirement for his reappointment as School Administrative Assistant I of
the Jose <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos High School and wherein the
academic requirement to said position is at least a fourth year college
undergraduate, when in truth and in fact, the said accused well knew that the
said statement is false and he did not reach the fourth year in a Bachelor of
Arts degree course, and consequently, by reason of said untruthful narration of
facts, his appointment to the said position was approved by the Civil Service
Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“All contrary to law.”</span> (p. 44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial following a plea of not guilty upon arraignment,
petitioner was found guilty as charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the trial court’s
decision is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, and in view of all the foregoing, this Court finds the
accused <span class="SpellE">Reolandi</span> M. Diaz guilty <span style="">as c</span>harged of the crime of
falsification of official document penalized under Article 171, paragraph 4, of
the Revised Penal Code, and he is therefore sentenced to suffer the
indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of two (2) years, four (4) months and one
(1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>,
as minimum, to six (6) years and (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
mayor, as maximum, and to pay a fine of ONE THOUSAND (P1,000.00) PESOS without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“Costs against the accused.”</span> (pp. 55-56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed the aforesaid judgment of conviction to the
intermediate Appellate Court, said appeal being docketed thereat as CA-GR No.
24580-Cr.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1983</st1:date>, the respondent court modified the trial
court’s decision by increasing the maximum of the indeterminate penalty of
imprisonment in the event of non-payment of the fine due to insolvency, but
affirmed the verdict of conviction in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent and <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portions of respondent court’s decision read:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The penalty for the offense of falsification of an official
document committed under Article 171, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code is <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u> </span>and a fine not to <span style="">e</span>xceed P5, 000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correct penalty that should be imposed on
the appellant applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law is imprisonment of Two
(2) Years, Four (4) Months and One (1) Day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span></span>
as minimum to Eight (8) Years and One (1) Day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u> </span>as maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of non-payment of the fine of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> due to insolvency, the <span style="">appe</span>l<span style="">la</span>nt<span style=""> </span>should be subject to subsidiary
imprisonment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, with the above modification as to the penalty and the
imposition of subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, the decision
appealed from is affirmed in all other respects with costs <span style="">a</span>gainst accused-appellant.” (p. 68, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was denied, hence, the
present recourse.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of petitioner that <span style="">he is </span>entitled to an acquittal because -<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. The findings of the lower cour<span style="">t</span> adopted by the respondent Intermediate Appellate Court that he
was <span style="">not </span>a <span style="">fourth</span> year <st1:place><st1:placename>A.B.</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>
student is contrary to the evidence presented.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The respondent Intermediate <span class="SpellE">Appelate</span>
Court gravely committed an error of law in convicting him as he did not have
any legal obligation to state in CS Form 212 that he was a fourth year college
student.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The Intermediate Appellate Court committed a grave abuse of
discretion in finding that the transcript of records (Exhibit I) is spurious.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the following facts, found by both the trial court and
respondent Intermediate Appellate Court, to have been sufficiently and
satisfactorily established by the evidence on record, it appears that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Reolandi</span> Diaz was a senior clerk at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Jose</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Abad</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1972 he sought appointment as School Administrative Assistant
I of the same school and as one of the requirements for appointment to said
position, filled up the prescribed personal information sheet, Civil Service
Form 212, and swore to the truth and veracity of the data and information
therein furnished by him before the proper administering officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As one of the required <span class="SpellE">informations</span>,
he indicated in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “A” that his highest educational
attainment was Fourth Year A.B. (Liberal Arts) allegedly pursued or obtained at
the Cosmopolitan and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Colleges</st1:placetype></st1:place>, respectively, during the
years 1950 to 1954 inclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
basis thereof, he was extended an appointment as School Administrative
Assistant I (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “B”).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His personal information sheet (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">“A”) together with his appointment
paper (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> “B”), the certification as to the
availability of funds for the position (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">“C”) and the resolution of the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> creating the position (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
“D”) were all forwarded to the Civil Service Commission for the approval of
petitioner’s appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">But contrary to petitioner’s claim that his highest educational
attainment was Fourth Year A.B. which he allegedly took at the Cosmopolitan and
<span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span> Colleges during the years 1950 to 1954, he
was never enrolled at the Cosmopolitan Colleges - which later became the <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos Educational Institution and still later the <span class="SpellE">Ortanez</span> University - at any time during the period covering
the years from 1950 to 1954, inclusive as certified to by the Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Ortanez</span> University, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Atilano</span>
D. Solomon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, petitioner was
never a student at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Colleges</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> during the first quarter of
school year 1953-1954, inclusive, as certified to by the school’s President,
Mrs. Virginia King <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span>
Yap.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither did petitioner ever enroll as a collegiate student at the
<span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span> Colleges in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> after he
finished his secondary course in the same school in June 1950, as certified to
by its Executive Director, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> Garcia.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, the name of petitioner was not included in all the
enrollment lists of college students submitted to the then Bureau Private
Schools of the Department of Education by the <span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span>
Colleges at San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and at <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, during the period during which petitioner
claimed <span style="">t</span>o<span style=""> </span>have been enrolled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">same
</span>thing is true with the lists submitted by the Cosmopolitan Colleges to
the said bureau.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner did not take the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He only presented in evidence an alleged
transcript of record (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) purporting to show that
he took up collegiate courses at the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span>
College in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, beginning from the first
quarter of the school year 1951-1952 up to the first quarter of school year 1953-1954
which transcript of record was allegedly signed by Mrs. Virginia King <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Yap, for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and in behalf of the then President of the
school, <span class="SpellE">lldefenso</span> <st1:place>Yap</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Mrs. Virginia Yap, testifying for the
prosecution disowned the said signature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, <span style="">at </span>the bottom
portion of the transcript is a printed notation reading -- this is <span style="">only </span>valid with the college seal and
signature of Pres. <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> D. Yap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit “1” lacks the imprint of the college
seal and the signature of President <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> Yap
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">No o</span>ther corroborating piece of evidence was presented by <span style="">petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioner’s posture, there was<span style=""> </span>ample, solid and conclusive evidence
adduced by the prosecution to prove that <span style="">he
was </span>not <span style="">a </span>fourth year A.B.
undergraduate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It<span style=""> </span>was clearly established
that the statement made by the accused -- that he reached fourth year A.B. and
that he studied for this course (Liberal Arts) at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Cosmopolitan</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Colleges</st1:placetype></st1:place> and the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Colleges</st1:placetype></st1:place>
from the years 1950 to 1954, is devoid of truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of these colleges <span style="">do </span>not at all reveal that petitioner
was even enrolled <span style="">at any </span>time
from 1950 to 1954 in its <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Liberal
  Arts</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
name does not appear and could not found in the enrollment lists <span style="">submitted </span>to the Bureau of Private
Schools by these <span style="">colleges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">While the petitioner in his defense presented
an alleged transcript (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> “1”) purporting to
show that he took up collegiate course at the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span>
College in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, beginning from the first
quarter of the school year 1951-1952 up to the first quarter of the school year
1953-1954, both the trial court and the respondent court correctly disregarded
said transcript as having emanated from a <span style="">spurious
</span>source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transcript presented
lacks the authenticating marks -- the imprint of the college seal and the
signature of the President of the college.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly observed by the trial court -</p>

<blockquote>“It <span style="">is </span>also quite
significant to note in this score that the accused in his defense failed to
present any corroborating piece of evidence which will show that he was<span style=""> </span>indeed enrolled in the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span> Colleges <span style="">from
the </span>first quarter <span style="">of </span>the
school year 1953-1954. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If he had <span style="">enrolled as a student </span>during this
period of time and he was <span style="">positive that </span>the
transcript of records issued to him and in his <span style="">possession is </span>genuine <span style="">and </span>valid,
it could have been easy for him to introduce corroborating evidence, i.e., the
testimony of any of his classmates or teachers in the different subjects that
he took to support his claim that he studied and passed these collegiate
courses at the said school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this he
failed to do despite all the opportunities open to him and in the face of
damning evidence all showing that he had not <span style="">really </span>enrolled <span style="">in this
school or </span><span style="">in </span>the other
school <span style="">mentioned by him in </span>the
personal information sheet that he filed up as requirement for his
appointment.” (p. 53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Following the doctrine <span class="GramE">laid</span> down,
however, in the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> B. Cruz, No.
L-15132, <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1960</st1:date>, 108
Phil. 255 and the earlier case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>
Molina, 29 Phil. 119, the crime committed under the foregoing facts, is
perjury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This offense, as defined in
Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code is the willful and corrupt assertion of a
falsehood under oath or affirmation administered by authority of law on a
material matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said article
provides -</p>

<blockquote>“Art. 183.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>False testimony
in other cases and perjury in solemn affirmation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
in its minimum period shall be imposed upon any person who, knowingly making
untruthful statements and not being included in the provisions of the next
preceding articles, shall testify under <span style="">oath
</span>or make an affidavit upon any material matter before a competent person
authorized to administer an oath in cases in which the law so requires.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Any person who, in case of a solemn affirmation made in lieu of an
oath, shall commit any of the falsehoods mentioned in this and the three
preceding articles of this section shall suffer the respective penalties
provided therein.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In that case of People v. Cruz supra, the accused <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> B. Cruz filled up an application form (Civil Service
Form No. 2) for the patrolman examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stated therein that he had never been accused, indicted or <span style="">tried </span>for violation of any law,
ordinance or regulation before any court, when in truth and in fact, as the
accused well knew, he had been prosecuted and <span style="">tried before </span>the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Cainta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, for different crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application was signed and sworn to by
him before the municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cainta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court in that case held:</p>

<blockquote>“This article is similar to section 3 of Act No. 1697 of the
Philippine Commission, which was formerly the law punishing perjury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under said section 3 of that Act, this Court,
in the case of United States v. <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> Molina (29
Phil. 119), held that a person, who stated under oath in his application to
take police examination that he had never been convicted of any crime, when as
a matter of fact <span style="">he </span>has previous
convictions, committed perjury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
facts in that case are almost exactly analogous to those in the present, and we
find no reason, either in law or in the arguments of the Solicitor General <span style="">to </span><span style="">modify or reverse the </span>conclusion of this Court therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">More so, because all the
elements of the offense of perjury defined in Art.</span><span style=""> 183 </span>of the Revised Penal Code concur
in the present case.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The elements of the crime of perjury are -<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(a) That the accused made <span style="">a
</span>statement under oath or executed an affidavit upon a material matter.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(b) That the statement or affidavit was made before a competent
officer, authorized to receive and administer oath.</p>

<p class="BODY">(c) That in that statement or affidavit, the accused made a
willful and deliberate assertion of a falsehood.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(d) That the </span>sworn
statement or affidavit containing the falsity is required by law or made <span style="">for </span>a legal purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Perjury under Art.</span> 183 of the Revised <span style="">Penal </span>Code <span class="GramE">carries</span>

period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
in its minimum period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no
