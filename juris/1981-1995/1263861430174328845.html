				<H3>EASTERN PAPER MILLS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND EDUARDO MALABANAN, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GRIÃ‘O-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On January 10, 1983, the petitioner, <span style="">after due notice, investigation, and hearing, dismissed the private
respondent </span>Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>, <span style="">an accounts payable clerk, for having
physically assaulted and verbally abused, within full view and hearing of the
other employees, a superior officer, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lopingco</span>,
who was then the personnel and administrative manager of the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the assault was private
respondent's resentment at being suspected of having stolen an ash tray from <span class="SpellE">Lopingco's</span> office </span>and <span style="">being questioned about the matter by the security office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent filed
a complaint for </span><span style="">illegal </span><span style="">dismissal (Annex "A") in the
Ministry (now Department) of Labor and Employment (NLRC-NCR-Case No. 1-191-83).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1987</st1:date>, dismissing <span class="SpellE">Malabanan's</span> complaint and finding that his dismissal from
employment was for just and valid cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the Labor Arbiter awarded him P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>
"financial assistance" (Annex "C").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>appeal by the
petitioner to the NLRC, the Commission on <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1988</st1:date> affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision with
modification. <span style="">It </span>awarded <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> separation or termination pay amounting to P10<span class="GramE">,780</span>, in lieu of financial assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex "E").</p>

<p class="BODY">Charging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC, the
company elevated the case to this Court on a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Earlier decisions of this Court which, in the name of compassionate
justice, awarded separation pay <span style="">or </span>financial
assistance to <span class="GramE">employees</span> who were lawfully dismissed <span style="">for </span>cause,
were re-examined and abandoned in the recent case of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone<span style=""> </span>Company vs. NLRC, G.R.
No. 80609, <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1988</st1:date>,
where We ruled:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Separation pay shall be allowed as a measure of social
justice only in those instances where the </i><i><span style="">e</span>mployee i</i><i><span style="">s </span>validly
dismissed for cause other than serious misconduct or those reflecting on his
moral character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the reason for
the valid dismissal is, for example, habitual intoxication or an offense
involving moral turpitude, like theft or illicit sexual relations with a fellow
worker, the employer may not be required to give the dismissed employee
separation pay, or financial assistance, or whatever other name it is</i><i><span style=""> ca</span>lled, on the ground of social
justice.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"A contrary rule would have the effect of rewarding rather
than punishing the erring employee for his offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">We</span> do not agree
that the punishment is his dismissal only and that the separation pay has
nothing to do with the wrong he has committed."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An award of separation
pay to an employee who was dismissed for a valid cause (in this case, for
serious misconduct) is legally indefensible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It contravenes Rule 1, Sec. 7, Book VI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing
the Labor Code which provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"Sec. 7.</i></span><i><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Termination of Employment
by Employer.</span> - The just causes for terminating the services of an
employee shall be those provided in Article 282 of this Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The separation from work of an employee
for a just cause does not entitle him to the termination pay</u>, provided in
the Code, </i><i><span style="">without </span>prejudice,
however, to whatever rights, benefits, and privileges he may have under the
applicable individual or collective agreement with the employer or voluntary
employer policy or practice."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only cases when
separation </span><span style="">pay </span><span style="">shall be paid, although the employee was </span>lawfully
<span style="">dismissed, are when the cause of
termination was not attributable to the employee's fault but due to: (1) the
installation of labor-saving devices, (2) redundancy, (3) retrenchment, (4)
cessation of the employer's business, or (5) </span>when <span style="">the employee is suffering from a disease and
his continued employment is prohibited </span>by <span style="">law </span><span style="">or is prejudicial to
his health and to the health of his co-employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Articles 283 and 284,
Labor Code.)</span> Other than these cases, an employee who </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">dismissed for a just and lawful cause is not entitled to separation pay
</span>even <span style="">if the award were to be
called by another name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the National
Labor Relations Commission dismissing the private respondent's complaint for
illegal dismissal is affirmed, but the award of separation pay or financial
assistance to him is hereby set aside for lack of legal basis.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Narvasa</span>, (Chairman), Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Medialdea</span>, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
