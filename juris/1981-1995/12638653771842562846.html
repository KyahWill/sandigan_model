				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition was originally filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1985</st1:date> to secure the release of
petitioners on <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> and to permanently enjoin the City
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City from investigating charges of
"Inciting to Sedition" against petitioners <span class="SpellE">Lino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, Benjamin Cervantes, <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span>
Garcia and Rodolfo Santos, (hereafter <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et

City Fiscal against them on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="2">February

and to enjoin the prosecution of Criminal Cases Nos. Q-­38023, Q-38024 and
Q-38025 (p. 349, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) and the issuance of warrants
for their arrests, including their arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since then President Ferdinand E. Marcos had ordered the provisional
release of <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al., the issue on <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> has become moot and academic (p. 396, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall thus focus on the question of
whether or not the prosecution of the criminal cases for Inciting to Sedition
may lawfully be enjoined.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners were arrested on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1985</st1:date> by elements of the Northern Police
District following the forcible and violent dispersal of a demonstration held
in sympathy with the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> strike called by the
Alliance of Concerned Transport Organization (ACTO).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they were charged with Illegal
Assembly in Criminal Cases Nos. 37783, 37787 and 37788 with Branch 108,

<p class="BODY">Except for <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al. who were
charged as leaders of the offense of Illegal Assembly and for whom no bail was
recommended, the other petitioners were released on bail of P3,000.00
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>,
et al.'s provisional release was ordered only upon an urgent petition for bail
for which daily hearings from <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="2">February
 1-7, 1985</st1:date> were held.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, despite service of the order of release on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1985</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>,
et al. remained in detention, respondents having invoked a Preventive Detention
Action (PDA) allegedly issued against them on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1985</st1:date> (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither the original, duplicate original nor
certified true copy of the PDA was ever shown to them (p. 367, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al. were subsequently
charged on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1985</st1:date>
with Inciting to Sedition, docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. Q-38023, Q-38024 and
Q-38025 (p. 349, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), without prior notice to
their counsel (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
filed recommended no bail (p. 349, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances surrounding the hasty
filing of this second offense are cited by <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et
al. (quoting from a separate petition filed on their behalf in G.R. Nos.
69848-50 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span> A. Ordonez vs. Col.
Julian <span class="SpellE">Arzaga</span>, et al."), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 'sham'
character of the inquest examination concocted by all respondents is starkly
bizarre when we consider that as early as 10:30 A.M. today, February 11, 1985,
Benjamin Cervantes was able to contact undersigned petitioner by phone
informing counsel that said Benjamin Cervantes and the 4 other persons who are
the subjects of this petition will be brought before the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Fiscal at 2:30 for undisclosed reasons:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>subsequently, another phone call was received by petitioning counsel
informing him that the appearance of Benjamin Cervantes et al was to be at 2:00
P.M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When petitioning counsel arrived in
the office of Assistant City Fiscal Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tugonon</span>,
the complainants' affidavits had not yet been received by any of the panel of
three assistant city fiscals, although the five persons under detention were
already in the office of said assistant fiscal as early as <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 P.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only at 3:00 when a representative of the military arrived bringing with him
alleged statements of complainants against <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Broka</span> (sic) et al for alleged inciting to sedition,
whereupon undersigned counsel asked respondent Colonel <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abad</span> 'who ordered the detained persons to be brought
to the office of Assistant Fiscal Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tugonon</span>
since there were no charges on file;’ and said Colonel <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abad</span> said aloud:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'I only received a telephone call from Colonel <span class="SpellE">Arzaga</span>
about 11:00 A.M. to bring the detained persons today - I am only the
custodian.' At <st1:time minute="15" hour="15">3:15</st1:time>, petitioning
counsel inquired from the Records Custodian when the charges against <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Broka</span> (sic) had been
officially received and he was informed that the said charges were never coursed
through the Records Office.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the facts
narrated above, respondents have conspired to use the strong arm of the law and
hatched the nefarious scheme to deprive <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Broka</span> (sic) et al the right to bail because the utterances
allegedly constituting inciting to sedition under Article 142 of the Revised
Penal Code are, except for varying nuances, almost verbatim the same utterances
which are the subject of Criminal Cases No. 37783, 37787 and 37788 and for
which said detained persons are entitled to be released on bail as a matter of
constitutional right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the
utterances allegedly made by the accused and which the respondents claimed to
be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Article 142 of the Revised Penal Code
are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Makiisa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> drivers,' '<span class="SpellE">Makiisa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">aming</span>

petitioning counsel and other members of the defense panel requested that they
be given 7 days within which said counsel may confer with their clients - the
detained persons named above, the panel of assistant fiscals demanded that said
detained persons should sign a ‘waiver’ of their rights under Article 125 of
the Revised Penal Code as a condition for the grant of said request, which is a
<span class="SpellE">harrassing</span> requirement considering that <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Broka</span> (sic) et al were
already under the detention, albeit illegally, and they could not have waived
the right under Rule 125 which they did not enjoy at the time the ruling was
made by the panel of assistant city <span class="SpellE">fiscaIs</span>."

<p class="BODY">They were released provisionally on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1985</st1:date>, on orders of then President F. E.
Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of their
release are narrated in Our resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1985</st1:date>, as quoted in the Solicitor General's
Manifestation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"G.R. Nos. 69848-50 (<span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span> A. Ordonez, Petitioner, vs. Col. Julian <span class="SpellE">Arzaga</span>, et al., Respondents).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span>
A. Ordonez filed this petition for habeas corpus in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, Benjamin Cervantes, <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> Garcia, Alexander <span class="SpellE">Luzano</span>,
and Rodolfo Santos, who were all detained under a Preventive Detention Action
(PDA) issued by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were charged in three separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
of the crime of illegal assembly under Art. 146, paragraph 3 of the Revised
Penal Code, as amended by PD 1834.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1985</st1:date>, the Honorable Miriam
<span class="SpellE">Defensor</span> Santiago, Regional Trial Judge of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, issued a resolution
in the above criminal cases, directing the release of the five accused on bail
of P6,000.00 for each of them, and from which resolution the respondent fiscals
took no appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately thereafter,
the accused filed their respective bail bonds. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This notwithstanding, they continued to be
held in detention by order of the respondent colonels; and on February 11,
1985, these same accused were ‘reinvestigated,’ this time on charges of
'inciting to sedition'<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> under Art. 142 of the Revised Penal
Code, following which corresponding cases were filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents complied with Our resolution
requiring them, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, to make a RETURN of the
writ of habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their RETURN,
it appeared that all the accused had already been released, four of them on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1985</st1:date> and one <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, nevertheless, argued that the
petition has not become moot and academic because the accused continue to be in
the custody of the law under an invalid charge of inciting to sedition."
(p. 395, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al. contend that
respondents' manifest bad faith and/or harassment are sufficient bases for
enjoining their criminal prosecution, aside from the fact that the second
offense of inciting to sedition is illegal, since it is premised on one and the
same act of attending and participating in the ACTO <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that while there
may be a complex crime from a single act (Art. 48, RTC), the law does not allow
the splitting of a single act into two offenses and filing two <span class="SpellE">informations</span> <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, further,
that they will be placed in double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The primary issue here is the legality of enjoining the criminal
prosecution of a case, since the two other issues raised by <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>,
et al. are matters of defense against the sedition charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule in favor of <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al. and
enjoin their criminal prosecution for the second offense of inciting to
sedition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the general rule is that criminal prosecution may not be
restrained or stayed by injunction, preliminary or final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are however so exceptions, among which
are:</p>

<blockquote>"a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To afford

Remedial Law Compendium, p. 188, 1988 Ed.)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the petition before Us, <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et
al. have cited the circumstances to show that the criminal proceedings had
become a case of persecution, having been undertaken by state officials in bad
faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents, on the other hand, had invoked a PDA in refusing <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al.'s release from detention (before their
release on orders of then Pres. Marcos).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This PDA was, however, issued on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="1">January
 28, 1985</st1:date>, but was invoked only on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1985</st1:date> (upon receipt of the trial court's order
of release).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the guidelines
issued, <span class="SpellE">PDAs</span> shall be invoked within 24 hours (in
Metro Manila) or 48 hours (outside Metro Manila) (<span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, G.R. No. 70748, October 28, 1985, 139 SCRA
349).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noteworthy also is <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al.'s claim that, despite subpoenas for its
production, the prosecution merely presented a purported <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copy of the invoked PDA (par. 4, Counter-Rejoinder, p. 367, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing circumstances were not disputed by the Solicitor
General's office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact they found
petitioner's plight "deplorable" (par. 51, Manifestation, p. 396, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The hasty filing of the second offense, premised on a spurious
and <span class="SpellE">inoperational</span> PDA, certainly betrays respondent's
bad faith and malicious intent to pursue criminal charges against <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have expressed Our view in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ilagan</u></span>
case that "individuals against whom <span class="SpellE">PDAs</span> have
been issued should be furnished with the original, and the duplicate original,
and a certified true copy issued by the official having official custody of the
PDA, at the time of the apprehension" (supra, p. 369).</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not begrudge the zeal that may characterize a public
official's prosecution of criminal offenders. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We, however, believe that this should not be a
license to run roughshod over a citizen's basic constitutional rights, such as
due process, or manipulate the law to suit dictatorial tendencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are impelled to point out a citizen's helplessness against the
awesome powers of a dictatorship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
while We agree with the Solicitor General's observation and/or manifestation
that <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al. should have filed a motion to
quash the information, We however, believe that such a course of action would
have been a futile move, considering the circumstances then prevailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the tenacious invocation of a spurious
and <span class="SpellE">inoperational</span> PDA and the sham and hasty
preliminary investigation were clear signals that the prosecutors intended to
keep <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al. in detention until the second
offense of "Inciting to Sedition'' could be facilitated and justified
without need of issuing a warrant of arrest anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact the corresponding <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for this second offense were hastily filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1985</st1:date>, or two days after <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al.’s release from detention was ordered by the
trial judge on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Constitutional rights must be upheld at all costs, for this
gesture is the true sign of democracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These may not be set aside to satisfy perceived illusory visions of
national grandeur.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of J. <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> v. Cruz <span class="SpellE">Paño</span>, We pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>"Infinitely more important than conventional adherence to
general rules of criminal procedure is respect for the citizen's right to be
free not only from arbitrary arrest and punishment but also from unwarranted
and vexatious prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (G.R. No. L-59524, <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1985</st1:date>, 134 SCRA 438-at p.
448)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, rule that where there is manifest bad faith that
accompanies the filing of criminal charges, as in the instant case where <span class="SpellE">Brocka</span>, et al. were barred from enjoying provisional
release until such time that charges were filed, and where a sham preliminary
investigation was hastily conducted, charges that are filed as a result should
lawfully be enjoined.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court is PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from
proceeding in any manner with the cases subject of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
