<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Since it appears that the
problem now presented before Us for consideration does not deviate from the
issue We have extensively discussed in Our resolution of March 15, 1982, We
have to restate certain portions </span>of the said resolution which can very
well serve as a backgrounder or refresher for a final clarification and
resolution of the problem of implementing the decreed compensation awards.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The pertinent portions
are quoted thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The main issue common to all these cases revolves on the
entity liable to pay the compensation claims of peti­tioners for ailments
initially suffered before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New
Labor Code -- whe­ther the Government Service In­surance System or the govern­ment
offices and agencies which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">are the
employers of petitioners -- which were filed with the Govern­ment Service
Insurance System under the provisions of the </span>New <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Labor Code, adversely decided by the System and affirmed by the
Employees' Compensation Commission, but </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">appeal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">this Court, were favorably con­sidered;
because We applied the more favorable and com­passionate provisions of the old
workmen's compensation law (Workmen's Compensation Act, </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">amended), instead of the provisions of the
New </span>Labor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Code on employees'
compensation which have been criticized as retrogressive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The social justice impact of the new com­pensation
law as compared to the prior compensation law has been deeply noted and
lamented in a resolution of this Court, through the Second Division, in the
case of <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> vs. ECC, et al., L-47008, March 8,
1978, <u>before <span class="SpellE">Corales</span></u>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">'Upon consideration of the allegations of the
petitioner and the comments </span>thereon of respondent Employees'
Compensation Commission, and the Government Service Insurance System, the Court
resolved to DENY the petition, noting that since the current Labor Code, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as amended by Presidential Decree No. 626,
has indeed reduced the broad instances of compensability under the former
Workmen's Com­pensation Act, the Court is powerless to apply the doctrines laid
down under said Act to peti­tioner's case, even as it feels that perhaps </span>a
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">legislative remedy</span> may be worthy
of study by those concerned to the end that what was conceded to be humane atti­tude
inspired by the social justice precepts of the Consti­tution may be reconciled
with the new or additional benefits, if any, that the Labor Code pro­vides in
compensation cases and thereby avoid the impression that in regard to the
security aspect of public or private employment, so worthy of compassionate
approach, there has been an intentional backward step in the policies of the
New Society.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The mother case is <span class="SpellE">Corales</span> vs. ECC,
et al., wherein peti­tioner, who started his career in the government in 1932
and retired on March 26, 1975 under Republic Act No. 660, as amended by
Republic Act No. 4968, filed on August 4, 1975 a compensation claim with the
Government Service Insurance System for his tuber­culosis which was traceable
to 1965 when he was downed by a high fever.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Our February 27, 1979 extended resolution, We stressed
that the substantive provisions applicable to his claim are those of the old
workmen's compensation law and not those of the New Labor Code on em­ployees'
compensation, because of the following considerations:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the cause of action accrued as early as
September, 1965, hence during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended; (2) the time limitation in Article 292
of the Labor Code -- which requires that workmen's compensation claims accruing
prior to the New Labor Code shall be filed with the appropriate regional offices
of the Department of Labor not later than March 31, 1975, otherwise, they shall
for­ever be barred -- does not apply <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to
petitioner who filed his claim on August 4, 1975 with </span>the Government
Service Insurance System; because of the control­ling jurisprudence under the
old law that the prescriptive period for claims which accrued under the
Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, is ten [10] years, it being a right
founded on statute and, as such, is con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">sidered
a vested right;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(3) the provisions of
the New Labor Code on Employees' Compensation, Book IV, Title II, apply only</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to
injury, sickness, disability or death accruing on or after January 1, 1975
(Art. 208); and more precise is Section </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">1(c) of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Rule III of the
Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, which declares that only injury or
sick­ness that accrued on or after January 1, 1975 and the resulting disability
or death shall be com­pensable under the rules; and (4) the filing by
petitioner of the claim with the GSIS, instead of with the appropriate regional
office </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the Department of Labor<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>does not militate against the claim; because
the filing of a claim in an office that has no authority to act on it can be
treated as having been filed with the appropriate agency as long as it is filed
within the period allowed by law /<span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vs. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">WCC, 77 SCRA 315-320, May 31, 1977/; and Art. 294, Title II (Transitory
and Final Provisions) of the New Labor Code provides that all actions and
claims accruing prior to the <span class="SpellE">effec­tivity</span> of this
Code shall be determined in accordance with the laws in force at the time of
their accrual and under the third paragraph of Article 292, Title II
(Prescription of Offenses and Claims), workmen's compensa­tion claims accruing
prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code and during the
period from November 1, 1974 up to Decem­ber 31, 1974 shall be processed and
adjudicated in accordance with the laws and rules at the time their causes of
action arose.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legal theory of the <span class="SpellE">GSIS's</span>
right to reimbursement is anchored on the quasi-contract nature of compensation
claims and aimed at the preservation of the State Insurance Fund for the
benefit of beneficiaries under the current law;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Primarily, compensation claims that should
have been filed before the defunct Work­men's Compensation Commission should be
pursued, by the prin­ciple of <span class="SpellE"><u>ubi</u></span> <u>jus</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>ibi</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>remedium</u></span>,
before the regular courts by private employees against their employers and
before the Commis­sion on Audit as money claims in case of government
employees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The rationale for the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
submission is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When adminis­trative agencies
are endowed with quasi-judicial powers, such as the National Labor Relations
Com­mission, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the In­surance
Commission, they eat into the general jurisdiction of regular courts so that, <u>al</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>con­trario</u></span>, if those administrative agencies
are abolished, their jurisdiction should revert back to the regular courts or
to other appropriate agencies vested by law with general jurisdiction such as
the Commission on Audit with respect to government claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The government employer concerned, not the
GSIS, should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">be directed to pay for
claims </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">accruing under the old
law, invoking the cases of <span class="SpellE">Avendaño</span> and <span class="SpellE">LaO</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To hold
government employers directly liable in these cases would do away with the

reimbursement by the government employer should not be utilized to delay
execution thereof since the government guarantees the solvency of the State
Insurance Fund; that the resolution of this Court directing the GSIS to pay
petitioner's award should be immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and no longer recon­sidered; and, that the <span class="SpellE">GSIS's</span>
submission that workmen's compensation claims be filed with the Commission on

<blockquote>"With respect to the second and third points of clarification
of the respondent ECC on the legal implications of the application by this
Honorable Court of the ten-year prescriptive period to the claim filed in the
present case (<span class="SpellE">Corales</span>) on claims filed under similar
circumstances in relation to the provision in the New Labor Code on
prescription of actions whereby all workmen's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">compensation claims accruing prior to January 1, 1975 are required to
be filed not later than March 31, 1975, otherwise they shall be forever barred;
and the legal basis for the Employees' Compensation Commis­sion to assume
jurisdiction over and apply the provisions of the repealed Workmen's Compensation
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Act </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to compensation cases involv­ing causes of
action accruing prior to January 1, 1975, the subject points of clarification
sought for are clear from Our pronouncement that the vested rights of
claimants, whose causes of action accrued before the regime of the new compensa­tion
scheme, over the more favorable and compassionate provisions of the previous
compensation statute, includ­ing the right to file their claims during the
ten-year </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">prescriptive period,
should be recognized and respected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Con­sequently,
respondents </span>GSIS <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">and ECC have
jurisdiction over claims the causes of action of which arose during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the old workmen's com­pensation law, which
must be </span>resolved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">by them on the
basis of the provisions of the old workmen's compensation law which is more
sympathetic to the plight of the working man as it is more expressive of the
social justice guarantee </span>of the supreme law of the land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As delineated above, peti­tioners whose causes of action
accrued during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the old
compensation law and continued even after its repeal unto the regime of the new
employees' compensation law, filed their respective claims for compensation
only after the deadline set forth under the new law; but which dead­line was
ruled by this Court as not barring the claims of the petitioners as filed with
the GSIS which under the new law is mandated to take cogni­zance of
compensation claims, the defunct Workmen's Compen­sation Commission and its
regional branches being then in the process of folding up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Relevant to state at this point is the fact that herein
petitioners (except petitioner <span class="SpellE">Barga</span>, who resumed
working after his temporary disability), like claimant in the Romero case [77
SCRA 482, 489 (1977)], despite their medical disability, persisted in working
by their sheer determination and ingenuity until their compulsory retirement (<span class="SpellE">Corales</span>), death <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Villones</span>), and mental incapa­city (<span class="SpellE">Cañeja</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must also be noted that the new compensation law in fixing
the March 31, 1975 deadline of filing claims accruing during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the old com­pensation law with the regional
offices (WCC) of the Department of Labor, overlooked the vested rights of
claimants to file their claims within the ten-year pre­scriptive period
recognized under the previous compensation law and jurisprudence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Hence, respondent GSIS and ECC as the only existing agencies
presently entrusted by law with the processing of claims for com­pensation
benefits have jurisdic­tion over the claims herein in­volved and over all
claims of claimants similarly situated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(While P.D. 954, issued on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">July
6, 1976, empowered the Secretary [now Minister] of Labor to assume and exercise
effective jurisdiction over workmen's compensation cases, this was however
expressly limited to the power and author­ity to determine, dispose of and to
take final action on work­men's compensation cases pend­ing as of March 31,
1976 before the Workmen's Compensation Com­mission and the Workmen's Com­pensa</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:31.0pt">t</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ion
Units in the regional offices of the Department [now Ministry] of Labor, and

<blockquote>"Indeed, to sustain the stand of respondent ECC on this matter
would result into a situa­tion wherein herein claimants and others similarly
circum<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">stanced would have a bare right
without any forum to enforce the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
vested right rooted from a social legis­lation enacted pursuant to the social
justice provision of the Constitution may not be rendered worthless by a
literal construction of the pertinent provisions of the New Labor Code, which
would thus inflict upon the peti­tioners and those equally situated the
harshness of the arbitrary and constricted time limitation set forth in its
Article 292.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The President-Prime Minister, in promulgating the New Labor
Code, did not deliberately intend to in­flict such injustice on claimant
employees and there­by deny them the social justice guaranteed by the
Constitution he swore to uphold and defend.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As long as this Supreme Tribunal exists and functions as the
vital instrument of social justice, the afore­said situation will never be
countenanced."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The proposition of the GSIS that compensation claims of,
government employees and those of private employees should be filed with and
pursued before the Commission on Audit and the regular courts, respectively,
not only has been advanced too late in the day to merit consideration, but also
appears inaccurate and cannot be upheld in the face of certain specific
provisions of the Labor Code (P.D. No. 626, Title II, as amended) and its
implementing rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">The exclusive responsibility of administering and disposing of
claims for compensation benefits is clearly defined in the following provisions
of the said Code, thus:</p>
