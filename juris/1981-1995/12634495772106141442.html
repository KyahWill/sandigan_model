seated for a while (pp. 13-14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="9">Sept. 8<span class="GramE">,1972</span></st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their house was low, one storey, about 5 by 6

house (pp. 14-31<span class="GramE">,36</span> <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

out of her house was <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> del Valle; followed by
the fourth person whose name she did not know; then Carlos <span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span>;
and followed by Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span> as the last person to
jump out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the four
persons ran towards the backyard of her house, and sped away (pp.16-19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="9">Sept. 8, 1972</st1:date>;

she stood in front of the barrio captain's house to her house was about 18
meters, and there was no obstacle to obstruct her view towards the stairs of
her house at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just past
<st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>, and the day was bright (pp.

what had happened; saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Apay</span>, <span class="SpellE">ano</span> bang <span class="SpellE">nangyayari</span>?" She noticed from his face that her
husband had slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband then
answered, telling her that blood was dripping from the floor of their
house:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Aba</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">tumutulo</span>

</span>Both went upstairs, and they saw their son, Mario lying unconscious on
the first floor, full of blood, and with stab wounds on his body (pp. 20-22,
40, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Sept. 8,1972; pp.15-16, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

shouted for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then told her
husband what she had seen earlier the four persons who jumped off their house,
with blood-stained weapons in their hands, as well as the identities of the
three persons, except the fourth person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her husband, however, advised her not to give any information or
statement to anybody, regarding what she had seen telling her that he himself
would kill the perpetrator's of their son's death (pp. 40-41, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="9">Sept. 8<span class="GramE">,1972</span></st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In response to her shout for help, many people arrived at their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Imme­diately their wounded and
unconscious son, Mario, was brought by her husband and a neighbor by the name
of <span class="SpellE">Pedy</span> to the hospital, while <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
San Gregorio remained at home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her son,
Mario died, however, on the way to the hospital (pp. 22, 45-46, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="9">Sept. 8, 1972</st1:date>;

fourth person jump out of her house with blood-stained weapons in their hands

Gregorio was able to convince her husband to refrain from taking the law into
his hands to avenge the death of their son.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both then decided to go to the authorities to reveal what they knew <span class="GramE">about</span> the felonious death of their son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, after the interment of their son, both
went to see Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Dilla</span> to inquire as to
the status of the police investigation of the son's case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the chief of police told them "to
lay low first" (pp. 51-52, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="9">Sept. 8<span class="GramE">,1972</span></st1:date>;

and her husband returned to the chief of police, and this time, the latter told
them that he would accompany them to the CIS-PC in <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>,
Laguna, where they were instead instructed to see the PC detachment at <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>, Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the latter place, they appeared, without the chief of police however,
accompanying them, before PC Sgt. Solano on <st1:date year="1971" day="18" month="6">June 18<span class="GramE">,1971</span></st1:date> wherein they

filing of the criminal complaint, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Dilla</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From their contention as

<p class="BODY">As repeatedly held in innumerable cases, motive is <span style="">not essential when the culpability of one

appellant's guilt beyond the peradventure of any doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is she who had no motive to falsely charge
appellants, as to entitle her testimony to full faith and credit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> knew the appellants very well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Lacabas</span> are the
"<span class="SpellE">barkada</span>" of his son, Mario, the deceased,
a fact established by admission of appellant Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span>
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other appellant, <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle, also admitted knowing <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>,
and the latter knowing him very well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
broad daylight, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> could not have been mis­taken
in identifying the appellants as the assailants of her son, and </span>her <span style="">candor in doing so, and charging them with an
extremely grave offense, is shown by her admission of not knowing the identity
of a fourth companion of appellants whom she saw jumping down their house,
holding blood-stained weapons, running towards their backyard in a hurried
escape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> is very natural and positive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified having seen earlier in the day
his son, Mario, with appellants and other persons collecting money from <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and tricycle drivers just 80 meters from her
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw her son next in the house
of <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantas</span> in a drinking spree, engaged in an altercation with
appellant del Valle, when she repaired in haste to said house on being informed
by her other son, <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>, about the trouble going on
in the house of <span class="SpellE">Pantas</span> involving his son, Mario, who
was already so drunk that she, brought him home with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once at their house, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
had Mario go to sleep, after which she left to go to the house of the barrio
captain but returned home after only a few minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on her way back home that she saw four
persons </span>jump <span style="">out from her house
with blood-stained weapons, three of whom are the herein appellants, the fourth
one not being known to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sight of
those persons jumping out from her house and escaping hurriedly through her
backyard prompted her to run towards</span> her house, and seeing her husband
lying on the ground floor just awakened, asked him what was happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter looked up and noticed blood
dripping from the first floor and exclaimed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Aba</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">tumutulo</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">dugo</span>." When the spouses went up, they saw their son
lying unconscious with many stab-wounds, bleeding profusely.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellants' contention there is nothing unbelievable
in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, mother of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told the Chief of Police
exactly as she saw the events unfold themselves from the time she saw the three
appellants jumping out from their house with a fourth companion unknown to her,
with blood stained weapons, her brief and shocked talk with her husband just
awakened from sleep who noticed the dripping of blood from the first floor, and
on going up the house, seeing their son lying unconscious and bleeding from
many stab wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Strangely, however, the
Chief of Police, testifying as a </span>defense witness, <span style="">declared that the father and brother of the
victim told him that the latter committed <span class="GramE">suicide,</span> and
that nobody told him who could have killed the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this testimony of the Chief of Police
which is clearly unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
number and nature of the wounds, the Chief of Police should have readily
discounted suicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The father and
brother of the victim could, therefore, not have told him that the deceased
killed himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, categorically stated that when the Chief of
Police arrived at their house, she told him (Chief of Police) that she saw the
appellants and a fourth unidentified person jump </span>out from their house
with blood-stained weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
cautioned the Chief of Police, however, about her statement because her husband
instructed her not to make such revelation to any person because he would like
to avenge the death of his son himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further discrediting the Chief of Police is his Sergeant's
testimony, also testifying for the defense, that when he saw his Chief at the
scene of the stabbing incident, when he arrived thereat, he no longer proceeded
with the investigation which was his very mission in repairing to the scene,
which appears contrary to the testimony of the Chief of Police that he
instructed the Sergeant to investigate the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the testimony of
the Chief of Police about suicide having been allegedly stated to him by the
victim's father and brother as the cause of death, same is plainly belied by
the entry in the police blotter which was presented as evidence by the defense
that "on or about 3:25 p.m., Councilor <span class="SpellE">Aljama</span>
arrived station and reported to this office that a person was stabbed at his
house while sleeping and died on the way to the hospital." From the entry
in the police blotter, it could be inferred that what had been stated by the
victim's kin in reporting to Councilor <span class="SpellE">Aljama</span> is that
the deceased was stabbed while he was sleeping, a fact that would rule out
suicide, <span class="GramE">specially</span> as no suicide weapon was ever found
which ought to be with, or just beside, the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants' contention as stated earlier that
the Chief of Police has belied <span class="SpellE">Natividad's</span> claim of
having identified the four assailants cannot, therefore, but meet with <span class="GramE">Our</span> outright rejection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is indeed hard to
explain how the Chief of Police ever got to inject the theory of suicide,
except to suspect his absolute impartiality and entire want of bias as demanded
of his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This suspicion is heightened
by how the police investigation got nowhere, and the Chief of Police advising
the victim's parents when they inquired about the progress of their
investigation "to lay low first." With the manifestly questionable
inaction of the Chief of Police and his Sergeant, the victim's parents found no
recourse but to approach the PC detachment in <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>,
Laguna, which actually </span>filed <span style="">the
criminal complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus is the delay in
filing the complaint explained by the police dragging their feet, coupled with <span class="SpellE">Natividad's</span> husband's initial reaction to the violent death
of his son of wanting to take the law in his own hands to exact vengeance from
the four killers, three of whom none other than appellants herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When the </span>PC <span style="">filed the complaint instead of the Chief of
Police doing so, the latter must have been </span>conscience­-<span class="SpellE"><span style="">striken</span></span><span style=""> and wanted to save his face by joining the
defense </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">trying to show that there was no real case
against appellants he must have also resented the act of the victim's parents
in going to the PC without previously informing him of their move which
reflected on his competence and trustworthiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not quite true, as
claimed by appellants, that there was no motive on their part to kill the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As testified to by the
victim's brother, <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span>, Jr., and his mother, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, the victim, while in a drinking spree with
appellants and other persons, got into a heated altercation with appellant del
Valle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was while Mario was engaged in
such altercation in the house of <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantas</span> that his mother arrived to take him home, upon being
informed by her other son, <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> Jr. of the trouble
her slain son Mario was involved in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon after falling asleep in his house, Mario was stabbed fatally by
assailants identified by <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> as appellants with
whom he had a drinking spree at the house of <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantas</span>, and an altercation
with one of them shortly before the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The distance from the house of <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantas</span> to the victim's house was </span>only <span style="">400 meters that there was no impossibility
for them to be the assailants of the deceased at the time and place of the
assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of this fact</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> coupled with appellants having been
positively identified as the assailants by the victim's mother, the alibi
interposed by appellants as their only defense, aside from the theory of suicide
as was sought ridiculously to be injected by the Chief of Police and appellant
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span>, cannot but be futile.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The information alleges
evident premeditation and treachery to have attended the commission of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evident premeditation, however,
has not been duly proven as the three elements thereof, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(1) <span style="">the time when the accused decided to commit the crime; (2) an act
manifestly showing that they clung to the determination to commit the crime; </span><span style="">and (3) </span><span style="">a sufficient lapse of time between the said determination and the
execution of the crime to allow them time to meditate and reflect on the
consequences of their acts</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> are evidently absent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery was neither shown to be present beyond any doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased might have <span style="">been </span>awake when his assailants
attacked him, fully aware and expectant of the assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What may be clearly present from the number
of his assailants as well as of the wounds inflicted, was abuse of superior
strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This aggravating circumstance
is usually held absorbed by treachery if the latter circum­stance is found
attendant independently of the former, but it does not constitute treachery
itself, which is distinct from that of abuse of superior strength, both as a
generic aggravating and as a qualifying circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Art. 14 Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The qualifying circumstance of abuse of
superior strength, however, has not been alleged in the information, so it can
only aggravate the killing, not qualify it to murder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dwelling was also clearly
present but only as aggravating circumstance of the crime committed, which is
that of simple homicide, as the killing would be, in the absence of any
qualifying circumstance, as none was proved beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment appealed from should be modified
by finding that the crime committed is homicide, not murder as charged,
aggravated by abuse of superior strength and­ dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty to be imposed should be only the
