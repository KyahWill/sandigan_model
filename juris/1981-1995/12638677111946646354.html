				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking to
reverse and set aside the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 07174, dated <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="11">27 November 1986</st1:date>, affirming the decision of the Regional
Trial Court of Laguna, dated <st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="12">13
 December 1984</st1:date>, in Civil Case No. S-251, which had dismissed herein
petitioners’ complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are:</p>

<p class="BODY">On separate dates, two (2) civil actions were filed before the
Regional Trial Court of Laguna, both for Quieting of Title and Recovery of
Possession with Damages and Injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Civil Case No. S-185, herein petitioners, the spouses Ricardo Serrano
and <span class="SpellE">Fidela</span> <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span>, were
the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Civil Case No. S-251,
the same petitioners-spouses were the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both suits involved the same property.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. S-251, the complaint of the petitioners-spouses
Ricardo Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Fidela</span> <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span>
for Quieting of Title and Recovery of Possession with Damages and Injunction
was filed against the herein respondents Miguel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>,
Damian <span class="SpellE">Canawin</span>, and Fidel <span class="SpellE">Adofina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their complaint, the petitioners claimed
ownership over two (2) <span style="">parcels of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> located at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Wawa</span>, Kay
<span class="SpellE">Bagsak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Siniloan</span>,
Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their claim was premised </span><span style="">on a </span><span style="">deed of sale allegedly executed in their favor by a certain Tomas <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Cuarigna</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners further alleged </span>that
respondents (defendants) unlawfully entered the property and used the same to
the damage and prejudice of the petitioners (plaintiffs).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Miguel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span> denied the
petitioners’ claim of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did
not, however, claim ownership for himself but admitted that he was merely <span style="">a tenant of </span>one Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>, the owner of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>
also called attention to a civil case entitled "Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>,
et al. v. Ricardo Serrano, et al.," docketed before the court as Civil
Case No. S-185, an action also for Quieting of Title and Recovery of Possession
with Damages and Injunction filed against petitioners and involving the same
parcels of land subject of Civil Case No. S-251.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Damian <span class="SpellE">Canawin</span> for his part
denied the claim of ownership of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he was merely a tenant of
Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Redor</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Villegas, and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Religioso</span>,
the owners of the said property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Fidel <span class="SpellE">Adofina</span> in turn
admitted that he was <span style="">a </span>tenant of the disputed property, pursuant to the authority
given to him by a certain Mauro <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No.
S-251, or on <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="8">17 <span style="">August 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, the RTC of Laguna in the other case, Civil
Case No. S-185, rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiffs therein, Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>, et al. and against the defendants, Ricardo
Serrano, et al. (herein petitioners).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span>plain­<span style="">tiffs in said
case were declared, after trial </span>on <span style="">the
merits, the owners of the land in dispute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners’ appeal from the judgment in Civil Case No.
S-185 was filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for which reason, said judgment became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in Civil Case No. S-251, herein respondents urged the
court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>to dismiss <span style="">petitioners complaint, on </span><span style="">the
ground that it had become moot and academic as a result of the judgment in
Civil Case No. S-185.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="12"><span style="">13
 December 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
complaint was dismissed, the court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u> <span style="">holding that the decision in Civil Case No.
S-185, which had declared that the disputed parcels of land belong to Isabel </span><span class="SpellE">Advento</span>, et al. (and not to Ricardo Serrano, et al.) indeed
rendered the complaint in Civil Case No. S-251 moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the RTC dismissing the complaint in Civil Case
No. S-251 was in turn questioned by the peti­tioners on appeal to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already adverted to, on <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="11">27 November 1986</st1:date>, the Court of
Appeals affirmed the decision of the RTC in said Civil Case No. S-251.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration was filed by the
petitioners but the same was denied on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="3">10
 March 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue is whether or not the Court of Appeals acted
contrary to law in rendering its decisio<span style="">n
</span>affirming that of the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u> dismissing the complaint <span style="">in </span><span style="">Civil </span>Case No. S-251.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to maintain an action to quiet title, the plaintiff must
have legal or equitable title to, or interest in the property in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Article 477 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 477.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff must have <span style="">legal </span>or
equitable title to, or interest in the real property which is the subject
matter of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He need not be in
possession of said property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>in Civil Case No. S-185 had ruled in
favor of Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>, et al., the plaintiffs
therein, and declared them owners of the property in dispute against defendants
therein, who are the herein petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judgment in Civil Case No. S-185 became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; plaintiffs' ownership over the property became
thenceforth incontestable and could no longer be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein petitioners are bound by that judgment
in Civil Case No. S-185, having been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
therein as defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. S-251 which led to the instant petition, it is
undisputed that the subject parcels of land located at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Wawa</span>,
Kay <span class="SpellE">Bagsak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Siniloan</span>,
Laguna are the very same parcels of land adjudged in Civil Case No. S-185 as
belonging to the plaintiffs therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That judgment is binding not only on the parties in said case, but also
on the plaintiffs' lessees, the herein respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a judgment is conclusive between the
parties and their successors-in-interest with respect to the matter directly
adjudged or as to any other matters that could have been raised in relation
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, an issue resolved in one case cannot be re-litigated in
a subsequent case even if based <span style="">on </span>a
different cause of action but litigating the same issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policy of the law is to avoid
multiplicity of suits <span style="">such </span>that
if an issue has been resolved in one case, it cannot be re-litigated in a
subsequent case even if based on a different cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition must fall, for it is clear that
the issue raised herein, i.e. <u>ownership</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>property</u>
<u>in</u> <u>question</u>, had already been resolved with finality in Civil
Case No. S-185 against the herein petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. S-185 was decided in favor of Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>, et al., declaring them the owners of the land,
subject of the instant complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, the cause of action of herein petitioners in Civil Case No.
S-251 re-­litigating the same issue of ownership has become moot and
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That cause of action must, as
a consequence, be dismissed as against respondents who are mere lessees of
Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>, et al..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, petitioners have no cause
of action against respondents for they (respon­dents) claim no ownership over
the above mentioned parcels of lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, they admit that the land belongs to Isabel <span class="SpellE">Advento</span>,
et al. and that they are mere tenants of said owners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">,<span style=""> </span></span>the
present petition is DENIED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
of the Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="11">27
