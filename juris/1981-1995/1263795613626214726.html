<p class="BODY">The Court will have to affirm the decision of the lower court 
sentencing the accused-appellant to the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, 
for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<span>&nbsp; </span>We do this with a heavy 
heart for he was less than sixteen years old when he committed the crime on 
<st1:date month="9" day="20" year="1984">September 20, 1984</st1:date>, and even 
now he is still a minor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> But the law 
is the law.<span>&nbsp; </span>As judges, we have the duty to apply it, for all its 
seeming harshness, notwithstanding considerations of compassion that can at best 
only mitigate but not entirely condone the punishment.</p>
<p class="BODY">The case is simplicity itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the above date, 
the accused-appellant was arrested at a billiard hall in the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span></st1:place></st1:city> 
by agents of the PC Narcotics Command shortly after passing four marijuana 
sticks to a PC informant who was posing as a buyer.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
accused-appellant had obtained the cigarettes from Albert Moore, to whom he also 
gave the marked money paid by the buyer.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city> escaped although he was 
apprehended later.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> was taken 
to the NARCOM headquarters for investigation, and there he signed a confession 
that he was subsequently to repudiate at his trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant originally pleaded guilty to the charge 
against him, but upon <span class="SpellE">rearraignment</span> on motion of his 
new counsel, he changed his plea to not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Moore, his co-accused, was not tried 
because he was found to be a drug dependent.<span>&nbsp; </span>In accordance with 
Section 31 of R.A. No. 6425, he was committed to the NBI Treatment and 
<st1:place><st1:placename>Rehabilitation</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> on recommendation of an 
accredited doctor of the Dangerous Drugs Board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The prosecution established the basic facts as narrated above 
through the testimony of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Remetiera</span>, NARCOM detachment commander, Sgt. Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>, and Agent <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosaroso</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> It also 
introduced the PC Crime Laboratory chemistry report, admitted by the defense at 
the pre-trial conference, that the cigarettes seized by the arresting officers 
at the time of the accused-appellant's arrest were positive for marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In addition to the said cigarettes and 
other exhibits, the sworn confession signed by the accused-appellant was also 
offered in evidence against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">Testifying as the lone witness for the defense, the 
accused-appellant practically admitted, on both direct and cross examination, 
that he had been approached by a person he identified as John <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> for marijuana cigarettes; that he said he would ask 
Moore; that he got the narcotics from Moore after paying him the money he got 
from <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>; and that he then gave the four sticks of 
marijuana to <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The rest of his 
testimony sought to show that he had been forced to sign his confession; that he 
did not know its contents; and that at the time it was taken he did not have the 
assistance of counsel or even his parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Although there is no evidence of the physical maltreatment of the 
accused-appellant, we nevertheless will reject the said confession because the 
record shows <span>that </span>it was obtained from <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> without advice of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Despite the reservations of some members 
of this Court, including the writer of this opinion, the ruling doctrine still 
requires that the waiver of the assistance of counsel should be made with the 
assistance of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">But such rejection notwithstanding, the Court believes that the 
other evidence presented by the prosecution, not to mention <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento's</span> own testimony, is sufficient to establish his 
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span>&nbsp; </span>The narration by the prosecution 
witnesses of the actual commission of the crime has not been refuted but was in 
fact supported by the defendant himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Significantly, the argument of the accused-appellant in his brief 
is limited to a little more than one double-spaced page only and does not deny 
the allegation that he actually passed the four sticks of marijuana from Moore 
to the poseur-buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> His disclaimer 
of criminal responsibility is based on the argument that a) he did not benefit 
from the transaction; b) none of the sticks was found in his possession; c) the 
marked money was never presented in evidence; and d) the buyer was not called to 
testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The applicable provision of the Dangerous Drugs Act is as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 4.</span><span>&nbsp; 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Sale</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, 
Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Prohibited 
Drugs.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a 
fine ranging from P20,000.00 to P30,000.00 shall be imposed upon any person who, 
unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer, deliver, give away to another, 
distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any prohibited drug, or for acting 
as a broker of any such transactions.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the victim of the offense 
is a minor or should a prohibited drug involved in any offense under this 
section be the proximate cause of the death of victim hereof, the maximum 
penalty herein provided be imposed (as amended by PD 1675 dated <st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1980">Feb. 17, 1980</st1:date>)."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">It is obvious from the above-quoted section that criminal 
liability shall attach to any unauthorized person who shall "sell, administer, 
deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any 
prohibited drug, or for acting as a broker of any such transaction." No 
pecuniary advantage need be proven.<span>&nbsp; </span>Actual physical possession at 
the time of arrest is not necessary and is in fact incompatible with the various 
acts punished, which involve precisely a transfer of possession.</p>
<p class="BODY">It was not necessary either to present the marked money because 
<span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> had already admitted receiving the same from 
the poseur-buyer and giving it to Moore, who had escaped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As for the non-presentation of the buyer, 
the Solicitor General correctly observed that the defense had every right to 
call such witness if it wanted to and could not now fault the prosecution for 
not doing so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> For its part, the 
prosecution had the right to present its case as it saw fit.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is ironic that Albert Moore, who actually owned and sold the 
marijuana cigarettes, has been spared the severe penalties of the law, and this 
because he was a drug dependent.<span>&nbsp; </span>His own addiction saved him from 
a prison term.<span>&nbsp; </span>By contrast, the accused-appellant, who is not a 
drug addict, must face the consequences of his act which has condemned him to 
imprisonment for life.<span>&nbsp; </span>The theory is that, having better control 
of his will, the violator who is not a drug dependent cannot claim the 
tenderness extended by the law to the latter.</p>
<p class="BODY">There seems to be something unfair in the situation of <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, who was not yet sixteen when he was arrested, but 
as we remarked at the beginning of this opinion, <span class="SpellE"><em>dura</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>lex</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;">, sed lex</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>In these 
circumstances, this youthful offender, who on top of everything is not entitled 
to suspension of his life sentence under the Child and Youth Welfare Code, as 
amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> can only hope for the grant 
to him of executive clemency if and when he can show he deserves it.</p>
<p class="BODY">Drug addiction is an international problem that, unfortunately, 
has not spared our country and in fact has victimized not an inconsiderable 
number of our people, especially the youth.<span>&nbsp; </span>That problem is far 
from contained and indeed may even get worse unless adequate steps are taken to 
prevent it from spreading even wider.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that 
our government is taking serious measures, including severe penalties not 
normally permitted but for the gravity and proliferation of this terrible 
offense.<span>&nbsp; </span>Against this affliction that has irretrievably destroyed 
the future of millions of persons who could otherwise have been useful members 
of society, we must take a united and determined stand.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court is affirmed, 
without any pronouncement as to costs.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p><span style="font-style: italic;"><st1:place>Yap</st1:place>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Narvasa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera,<span style="font-style: normal;"> and</span> Feliciano, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span>
