				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before her death, <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Iscala</span> was employed as an elementary school teacher in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Buruanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Buruanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> for fifteen
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In September of 1969, in the
course of her employment, she underwent medical treatment for stomach ailment
diagnosed by the examining physician as peptic ulcer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On several occasions thereafter, i.e., on
February 3, May 18, July 6, <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1970</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1972</st1:date>,
<st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1973</st1:date>, January
10 and <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1974</st1:date>, she
was treated by the same physician for the same illness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="2">Feb.
 25, 1975</st1:date>, she was confined at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Community</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> and <st1:place><st1:placename>Health</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> for Amoebic <span class="SpellE">Abcess</span> and on March 1 of the same year, she succumbed to
Acute <span class="SpellE">Pancreatitis</span> and Recurrent Duodenal Ulcer.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the death of <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Iscala</span>, her surviving spouse, the petitioner herein, filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>claim for income benefit under
Presidential Decree (PD) 626 with the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner then appealed to the Employees
Compensation Commission which dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of
the GSIS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In deciding thus, the
Employees Compensation Commission applied the new employees compensation
program and held that the sickness which caused the death of <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Iscala</span> was not listed as an occupational
disease under the Rules Implementing PD 626.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither did the petitioner prove that the risk of contracting the
ailment was increased by the deceased's working condition as a teacher, a proof
required for compensability under the new law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the petitioner is entitled to
his claim for income benefit by virtue of his wife's death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For although the deceased passed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">away </span>on March 10, 1975, just two
months and ten days after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the new
law, on January 1, 1975, the sickness which caused her demise could be traced
way back in 1969 when she first had her medical treatment for peptic
ulcer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of action for the
income benefit claim, therefore, has arisen as early as 1969 before the new law
had even been conceived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Following the
principle that "rights accrued and vested while a statute was in force
ordinarily survives its repeal,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
we must apply the old Workmen's Compensation Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the said law, whenever an illness was
contracted by an employee in the course of his employment, there existed a
legal presumption of causation, i.e., that the sickness was caused by and/or
aggravated by the nature of the job.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
onus to rebut this presumption was on the employer who was required to show
convincing proof that while the illness of the employee supervened in the
course of employment, it did not necessarily follow that it also arose from
such employment or was at least aggravated by it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The opinion of the deceased's attending physician that the
sickness which caused the death of <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Iscala</span> was not directly caused by the employee's duties,
thus, disconnecting the deceased's ailment from her employment is not
sufficient to overthrow the presumption of compensability mandated by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Agana</span></st1:place></st1:city>
v. <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
we said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [U]<span class="SpellE">nder</span> the law, it is not required that the employment be the
sole factor in the growth, development or acceleration of claimant's illness to
entitle him to the benefits provided for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is enough that his employment had contributed, even in a small
degree, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to the development of his
disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been repeatedly held
that under the Workmen's Compensation Law, it is not necessary for a claimant
to carry the burden of proof to establish his case to the point of demonstration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient to show that the hypothesis
on which he bases his claim is probable."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the applicable law being in the nature of social
legislation, its provisions must be interpreted liberally in favor of employees
because the law was intended to protect their rights.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inevitably there is no other recourse but to grant the claim of
the herein petitioner for income benefits.</p>
