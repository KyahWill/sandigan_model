with falsification of public document under Article 172, Paragraph 1 of the
Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the two accused were found guilty by the city court

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of conviction of <span class="SpellE">Clodualdo</span> <span class="SpellE">Origenes</span> was affirmed
with no modification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> was, however, found guilty as a principal and his
sentence was raised to imprisonment from four (4) months and one (1) day to three

in CA-G.R.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No. 23933-CR indicates that
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> received a copy of the appellate decision
on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 14.0pt">March 10, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">
(CA <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>, p. 43) and a copy of the resolution
denying his motion for reconsidera­tion on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">April 15, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(CA <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>, p. 91).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1982</st1:date>,
Atty. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> filed a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
of the appellate decision finding him guilty as co-principal through conspiracy
of the crime of falsification of public document.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petition was denied
by the First Division </span>of this Court on <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1982</st1:date> on two grounds - First, the petition had no
statement of material dates to determine the timeliness of its filing; <span class="GramE">Second</span>, even if the material dates were given, the petition
would nevertheless be denied because it had no merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was also referred to the Court <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> for disbarment of Atty. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1982</st1:date>,
a motion for reconsideration of the <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1982</st1:date> resolution was received.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The motion stated that the docket, legal research, and allied fees in
G.R. No. 60654, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, were all paid on <st1:date year="1982" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the motion to show that
the petition was filed and these fees paid before the period to appeal the
decision of the Court of Appeals had lapsed except a bare statement that the
fees were paid within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, the examination of the
records of the Court of Appeals shows that the petition which was filed with
the Supreme Court on <st1:date year="1982" day="7" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">June </span>7, 1982</st1:date> was filed
fifty-three (53) days after the petitioner received on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1982</st1:date> the resolution denying his motion
for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the falsification
charge, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> merely reiterated the exhibits
filed during trial and passed upon by the Court of Appeals to show that he was
innocent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="6">June
 29, 1982</st1:date>, the disbarment proceedings were docketed as
Administrative Case No. 2410.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> was required to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why
he should not be disbarred by reason of final judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, he was suspended from the
practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> has shown no cause why he
should not be disbarred by reason of final judgment.</p>

Court for any deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in such office,
grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving
moral turpitude, or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take
before admission to practice, or for a willful disobedience of any lawful order
of a superior court, or for corruptly or willfully appearing as an attorney for
a party to a case without authority so to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

residence and he, therefore, knew that the supposed affiant was an impostor but
he was also aware when he prepared the falsified deed that <span class="SpellE">Nestoria</span>
had been dead many years and had, in fact, attended the wake and burial of the
supposed vendor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are factual
findings amply supported by the records which we should not disturb.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, the First Division of this
