<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version of the facts of the case is synthesized
by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> in
the statement taken by the police alleges that around 6:00 of April 14, 1987,
he came from his brother Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> at Gerona
St., <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While he was going home, the accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> tagged along with him and confronted Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> with the statement as to whether he was '<span class="SpellE">siga</span>', meaning brave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That time, the accused was holding a firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
answered the accused that he was not brave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that instant, the accused was apprehended by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rizalde</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Gascon</span>
and Pat.</span> <span style="">W. </span>Reyes of WPD, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
upon the complaint of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>, who was
threatened by said accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
with a firearm (pistol).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gascon</span> testified that this Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
sought his help regarding the person with a gun at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Dandan</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he arrested the suspect, the
accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise he testified that there was an
attempt to settle the case between accused and complainant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">But in view of the firearm taken from the accused, already marked
as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">D and the live

for accused, the witness maintained that he arrested the accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> upon the
complaint of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense narrates <span style="">a </span>different version:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
accused testified on direct examination by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cabaron</span>,
CLAO, that in the house of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>, a gambling
known as Lucky 9 was held on April 14, 1987 in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were ten persons who were
gambling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, there was
trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, a certain Eddie got mad
because he was chased by a certain <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> Diego who
turned out to be Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mang</span> Diego (Rodrigo
<span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>) lifted a chair and was about to hit a
certain Eddie who got mad, then this accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> pacified <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> Diego or
Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his attempt to pacify Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>,
accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was
able to hit Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> and he boxed the said
Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> and left the house of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, a
certain <span class="SpellE">Jetjet</span> fetched the accused telling him that
his wife arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">Jetjet</span> was later on identified as Cornelia <span class="SpellE">Calilong</span> <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They boarded a tricycle in fetching his
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While inside the tricycle, a
Patrolman came over and hit him with a gun at the back of the side car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This patrolman turned out to be Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gascon</span> and the accused testified further that he was mauled
while being arrested by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gascon</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused at that
moment while being mauled testified furthermore, that he did not say anything
against Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gascon</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, the
accused was brought to Precinct I, <st1:city><st1:place>North Bay</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
inside Precinct I, WPD, <span class="SpellE">Jetjet</span>, alias Cornelia <span class="SpellE">Calilong</span> <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> shouted, 'what is
the fault of my companion’<span class="GramE">, referring</span> to accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that instant, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
followed the accused to the police, Precinct I.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gascon</span> asked accused what case and the
accused told him the quarrel with <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> Diego or
Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> on <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused further testified that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gascon</span>
asked P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> so that he can be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused answered that he has no money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the case was filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the accused testified that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gascon</span> used to be in the house of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>, the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was the reason why accused came to know Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gascon</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, Fiscal Hernandez <span style="">was </span>able to elicit from the accused
that accused has no job and during the date of the incident he was only about
one month old in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
as he came from <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His only job is gambling or playing Lucky 9
in the house of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant raises the following assignment of errors in
this appeal:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant despite the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Executive Order No. 107 which made the
information fatally defective and void;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant when the prosecution failed
to prove the alleged absence of license or permit, assuming but not admitting
that the firearm and the ammunition were in his possession;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming but not
admitting that the accused-appellant was in possession of the firearm and
ammunition, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> gravely erred in admitting the same
in evidence as these were taken in violation of the constitutional right of the
accused-appellant against unreasonable searches and seizures; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
gravely erred in not finding that the accused-appellant was a victim of a
frame-up.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's plea for reversal is well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adopting the same view, the Solicitor
General, filing a manifestation and motion in lieu of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief, recommends that this case filed against appellant in Criminal Case No.
87-54006 be dismissed as the same is premised on <span class="GramE">a void</span>
information.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the commission of the crime, or on April 14, 1987,
Executive Order No. 107, dated December 24, 1986, which gave holders and
possessors of unlicensed firearms and ammunition a period of six (6) months
from its date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> within which to
surrender the same to the proper authorities without incurring criminal
liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, was indeed in legal force and
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
was extended to <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1987</st1:date>
by Executive Order No. 222.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While said
executive orders did not have the effect of legalizing the unlicensed
possession of firearms and ammunition, they did temporarily lift criminal
liability for such unauthorized possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Executive Order No. 107, however, <span style="">is </span>not without exceptions, since it does not bar prosecution of
a person for illegal possession of loose or unlicensed firearms, ammunition or
explosives if the same are carried outside his residence, unless it is for the
purpose of surrendering the same as evidenced by a prior written authority
issued by the proper official to transport the same for said purpose, or if he
commits an offense with the use of said unlicensed firearm, ammunition or
explosive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal inquiry, therefore, boils down to these
propositions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that appellant
was indeed in possession of the firearms and ammunition, is it necessary for
the prosecution, in order to make appellant liable for the offense, to allege
in the information that appellant either brought the same out of his residence
not for the purpose of surrendering them or that he used them in the commission
of another offense?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>,
if neither of the exceptions were alleged in the information, may they be
proved just the same during the trial?</p>

<p class="BODY">The cited case of <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <st1:city><st1:place><u>Asuncion</u></st1:place></st1:city>,
etc., <u>et</u> <u>al</u>., <u>ante</u>, has already provided the answers to
these queries in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In <u>People</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Lopez</u> (79 Phil. 658 [1947]), the Court already ruled that,
under Republic Act No. 4, the use or the carrying of firearms and/or ammunition
was an ingredient, if not the sole ingredient, of the offense, i.e., the very
acts which were punished, subject to certain conditions, and hence, should be
alleged and proved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Austria</u> (94 Phil. 897
[1953]), the Court also ruled that in order that an information charging
illegal posses­sion of firearm and ammunition, under Republic Act No. 482, may
be deemed sufficient, it must allege that the accused was using the unlicensed
firearm or carrying it in his person at the time he was apprehended by the <span style="">authorities with said firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Citations in parentheses added).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It bears noting that the laws referred to
in the above-mentioned cases, Republic Acts Nos. 4 and 482, likewise provided as
exceptions wherein criminal liability would attach (1) the use of a firearm or
ammunition or (2) the carrying thereof by the person except for the purpose of
surrendering the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the corollary question, the <st1:city><st1:place><u>Asuncion</u></st1:place></st1:city>
case disposed of this by reiterating the rule that the presentation of evidence
cannot have the effect of validating a void information, or proving an offense
which does not legally exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, as
in this case, the information is not merely defective, but it does not charge
any offense at all, technically speaking, that information does not exist in
contemplation of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the foregoing considerations, we no longer find it necessary
to rule upon the other errors assigned by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the judgment appealed from is hereby <span style="">REVERSED </span>and <span style="">SET ASIDE, </span>without prejudice to the filing of the proper
information in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of
this decision be furnished the Honorable Secretary of Justice for his
information and appropriate action.</p>
