at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening,
<span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> and Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> were at the house of Barrio Councilman <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span> at <span class="SpellE">Malabanban</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, where a dance

Ruben <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span>, approached Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>
and asked why <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>
was with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>
replied that he and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>
were on their way to get bananas which they will use for the "<span class="SpellE">lupakan</span>" at <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span>

<p class="BODY">Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> proceeded afterwards to the house of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Bati</span> to ask for some bananas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bati</span> gave them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>bunch and because it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>dark on
that particular evening, he also lent them a long flashlight with a wide head.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> left the house of <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>

<span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>, who held the flashlight, walked ahead of <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two
had just passed a bridge over a canal which was around 300 meters from the
house of <span class="SpellE">Bati</span> when <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>
saw <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> fall on his back face upward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By means of the flashlight which also fell to
the ground, <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> who was about one meter away, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">saw </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span>
beating the deceased on the forehead while <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

and he and his wire went to <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin's</span> wife and informed her about what happened to <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>.</p>

to be held in <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span> place, decided to follow
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
his way, <span class="SpellE">Bati</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

lying dead on the pathway.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon closer
examination, <span class="SpellE">Bati</span> noticed that <span class="SpellE">Bayanin's</span>
forehead was broken and there were wounds on his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, he went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> and asked him about what happened to <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was told that Ruben <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Ornoza</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later, </span><span class="SpellE">Bati</span> went to the house of Mario

<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1977</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>, the brother <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the deceased, was sent by his
father to get their <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> from the grazing
area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While on his way, he heard
somebody talking ahead of him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He hid
behind coconut tree near the pathway and while thus hidden, two men passed by
the place where he was hiding, whom he recognized <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>be Ruben <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span> and Mario <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> heard Ruben <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span> asked Mario <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span> about
the condition of <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>
and Mario answered:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Siguradong</span> <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyon</span>." <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> waited for the two

<p class="BODY">On that very same evening at around <st1:time minute="45" hour="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">9:45 </span>o'clock</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> reported the
incident to the Integrated National Police of <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cpl.
Manuel C. <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span>, together with Pat. <span class="GramE">Cesar <span class="SpellE">Magsumbol</span> and Pat.</span> Cesar de
Chavez, accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>,
conducted an investigation right at the place of the incident at <span class="SpellE">Malabanban</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> where they saw the
body of <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> on
the pathway, with injuries on the head and wounds on the chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police recovered at the scene a
flashlight with the lights still on, at a distance of about one-half meter from
the cadaver of the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Photographs
of the cadaver and the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>surroundings
were taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Presentacion</span>
V. <span class="SpellE">Daelo</span>, conducted a <u>post</u> <u>mortem</u>
examination of the cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> at about 4:15 o'clock in the afternoon of September
11, 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the medico-legal report
that she issued, the causes of death of <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span> are fracture of the skull and massive hemorrhage
due to stab wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Frago</span> to prove that from 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of
September 10, 1977, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Mario <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span> was in his house at <span class="SpellE">Malabanban</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span> and stayed there during the
night because they were going to haul coconuts the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span> had a
similar defense of alibi through <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span> who testified that from 7:00 O'clock in the morning
of September 10, 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ruben was in his
house helping in the preparation on the occasion of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo's</span>
birthday celebration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused-appellants
raise two <span class="GramE">assignment</span> of errors as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred
in giving credence to the testimony of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>
on the ground that said testimony is incredible, inconsistent and contrary to
the natural course of things and human conduct.<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">II.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred
in finding the accused?appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt, on the
basis of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
weak defense.</span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The first<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>assignment of error assails the </span>credibility
of the prosecution's eyewitness, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To support its contention, the defense cites parts of <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span> testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">where
</span>he allegedly manifested incredibility as a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span>
story about receiving threats from the <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span>
brothers and being scared afterwards is allegedly negated by the testimony of
the police officer that when he went to look for the accused-appellants on
information of <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>, they were nowhere to be
found and that <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> was far from being scared
because he relayed the incident to his wife and later <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defense argues that if <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span> testimony is to be
believed then he would have been killed as threatened because he had already
informed the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the police officers could not locate the
accused-appellants is not an indication that beforehand, the two of them had
already gone to <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> and had warned him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span>
assertion that he was so scared is supported by the fact that he did not report
the matter to the police authorities <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">until
</span>the latter went to him and asked him about the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The actuation of <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span>
is not to be wondered at since it is not uncommon for a witness to a crime to
show some reluctance about getting involved in a case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The natural reticence of most people to get
involved in a criminal case is of judicial notice (People v. Coronado, G.R. No.
68932, October 28, 1986, 145 SCRA 250; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacabes</span>,
G.R. No. 55417, June 24, 1985, 137 SCRA 158).</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, the defense puts at issue <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span>
testimony that when he witnessed the killing of <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayanin</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>dropped
the bunch of bananas he was carrying when allegedly nowhere in the photographs
presented as exhibits was a bunch of bananas shown.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>photographs
do not show any bunch of bananas cannot be taken to detract from the
credibility of <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span> testimony since the two
photographs, a close-up of the body of the deceased, which were presented by
the prosecution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>part of its exhibits cover a very limited area (Exhibits
"B" and "C").</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the defense assails <span class="SpellE">Rebistual's</span>
testimony that he witnessed the crime through the single light or a flashlight
arguing that if it were so then <span class="SpellE">Rebistual</span> could not

because it has the advantage of observing the demeanor of a witness while on

<p class="BODY">The second assigned error relates to the defense of alibi.</p>

he was staying which is only one (1) kilometer (TSN, June 24, 1980, p. 219) and
