				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the judgment rendered by the Regional Trial
Court, 12th Judicial Region, Branch XX, <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, <span class="GramE">Sultan</span> <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>, convicting the
accused, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, of
Murder and thereby sentencing him the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are no witnesses to this violent incident except the
protagonists, one of whom survived and lived to tell his tale while the other
succumbed to his stab wounds and his lips were forever sealed, unable to
dispute the narration of the herein accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the deceased had other enemies and was a
person of violent temper especially when he was drunk (Hearing of October 27,
1983, TSN pp. 34; 45).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, defendant-appellant is a married man with
eleven (11) children (Hearing of June 21, 1984, TSN p. 4).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is a simple man who calls people by their
nicknames and a hard working man who would work until late at night
(Appellant's Brief, p. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> had a dispute with the defendant-appellant over the
planting of corn on a piece of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> he had been leasing
was taken away from him by its owner and leased to the defendant-appellant
causing him (<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>) to leave the locality for a
while.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> bore a grudge against the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">But appellant admitted that he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> resulting in the latter's death (Appellant's
Brief, p. 2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of such admission,
the burden of evidence was shifted from the prosecution to the defense and it
became incumbent on the latter to prove self-defense to the satisfaction of the
court, to exculpate him from liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1982</st1:date>, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Pacaonces</span>, a farmer
tenant and an immediate neighbor of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>, noticed the presence of the latter in his hut
where there was a light.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had a
conversation with <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
which did not last long.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
thereafter, he noticed that the light from the house of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> had been turned off and he presumed that <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> had gone to sleep (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 23).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Pacaonces</span>
was roused from his sleep by someone shouting "<span class="SpellE">Doy</span>,
please help me because I have been stabbed".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He peeped through the window and saw <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> trying to enter
his (<span class="SpellE">Pacaonces</span>) house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Feeling apprehensive, he shouted for help
from his neighbor <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this instant <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> succeeded in forcing the door downstairs open
and dived to the floor inside the house (TSN, October 27, 1983, p. 32; Brief
for <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, p. 2), where he died later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of his death, <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> was clutching the handle of his scythe minus
the scythe itself (Brief for <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, p. 3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Appellant</span> who was
also seriously wounded, immediately surrendered to Sgt. Dante <span class="SpellE">Palabrica</span>, the local Philippine Constabulary (PC)
Detachment Commander.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After his
surrender to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Palabrica</span>, he was brought by the
same to the Bautista Clinic for treatment (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
28).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1982</st1:date>,
Station Commander <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sustiguer</span>,
Jr., filed Criminal Complaint No. 2245 for Murder against the accused <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, Sr., in the Municipal
Circuit Court of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, Mariano Marcos, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately thereafter, the accused was
arrested and detained in the Municipal Jail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day he filed a waiver of rights to preliminary investigation
which was given due course and granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As above-stated, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>,
Sr. admits the fact that he killed <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 3, Brief for <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the version of the defense is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1982</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>,
Sr. was on his way to the house Of Eduardo (<span class="SpellE">Dodoy</span>) <span class="SpellE">Paca­onces</span>, when he passed the hut of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
coughed as was the custom of the place to let the occupant know he was passing
by.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
learned who was passing, he came out looking angry and told <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>,
Sr. that his blood boils each time he sees him, because had it not been for
him, the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> would not have been taken away from
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>,
Sr. pleaded that he had no fault, Boy <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
challenged "So, what do you want?" Immediately, <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
pulled out a scythe from his waist and thrust it at <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>,
Sr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter retreated, but Boy <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> stepped on his left foot causing him to fall down
with his face up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Boy <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> hacked at him, hitting him on the forehead and upper
lip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, Sr. remembered the jungle knife at his waist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He pulled it out and thrust it twice at his
lunging assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
ran towards his house, but when <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, Sr. was
beginning to run away, <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> again jumped on him and <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, Sr. had to stab him with the jungle knife once more
(Hearing of June 21, 1984, TSN, pp. 8-16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he ran away and surrendered to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Palabrica</span>
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 19).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was then
brought to the Bautista Clinic for treatment of his wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Regional Trial Court, after hearing and careful evaluation of
the evidence presented by the parties gave more weight to the evidence of the
prosecution and found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder, the
<span class="SpellE">dispo­sitive</span> portion of the decision reading:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Court
finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>,
Sr. guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder qualified the
aggravating circumstance of voluntary surrender, both off-setting each other,
to be appreciated and considered, the Court hereby sentences the accused <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, Sr., the penalty of
RECLUSION PERPETUA and to indemnify the surviving heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> the amount of
TWELVE THOUSAND PESOS (P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as damages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused while in detention at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sampaguita</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, Metro Manila, in a letter addressed to
the Supreme Court on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1985</st1:date>,
manifested his intention not to pursue his appeal for the reason that he could
not afford to hire a lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 47).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="7">July
 2, 1986</st1:date>, the Supreme Court accepted the appeal interposed by the
accused-appellant and appointed Atty. Hector <span class="SpellE">Hofilena</span>
as his counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">Accused submitted his appellant's brief on <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1986</st1:date> docketed as G.R. No. 73981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as represented by the Solicitor General, also filed the cor­responding Brief
for the <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant submitted his reply brief (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
83-88) on July 13, 1987 in compliance with the resolution of this Court of
March 25, 1987 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 77).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused appellant raised the following errors alle­gedly
committed by the trial court:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">I</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in not dismissing the case for lack of
jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">II</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in holding that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> was stabbed three
times while he was sleep-in in his hut.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">III</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in giving full credence to the testimony of
Sgt. Dante <span class="SpellE">Palabrica</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">IV</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in not holding that defendant-appellant acted
in self-defense.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issues in this case are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) whether or not the accused has
sufficiently substantiated the justifying circumstance of self-defense; and (b)
whether or not the Regional Trial Court of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>,
Branch XX had juris­diction to try the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having admitted that he killed the deceased, the appel­lant who
claims self-defense was duty bound to prove the essential requisites for this
justifying circumstance, namely:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">unlawful</span> aggression
on the part of the deceased;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">lack</span> of sufficient
provocation on the part of the accused;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">reasonable</span> necessity
of the means employed by the accused to defend himself.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We believe there was unlawful aggression on the part of the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was he who went down his
house to confront the accused and it was he who blurted out the accusation that
were it not for the accused, he (the victim) would still have his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was he
who, irritated by appellant's answer that he (appellant) had nothing to do with
the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, lashed out with his scythe at the appel­lant,
injuring the latter in the process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, this was unlawful aggression of the clearest degree,
committed by an individual known to be a man of violence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution makes much of the fact that appellant was
carrying a "jungle knife" instead of a bolo (which alle­gedly is what
farmers usually use in their farm work) but then, as aptly explained by him, a
knife is much more convenient to carry than a bolo, which in the usual course
of things is heavier and more bulky.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides it was night time and his farm work was finished for the
day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A knife for self-protection was
what common sense dictated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not
carry a knife to deliberately kill:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>there was at the beginning no need for violence of any kind.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also harps on the presence of blood on the
bedding of the deceased as well as the fact that the victim was seen still
clutching the handle of the scythe minus the blade itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This does not eliminate the great possibility
that he who harbored a deep-seated grudge against the accused was the person
who started the whole bloody fray.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
significant thing should not escape <span class="GramE">Us</span>, and this is
the fact that accused was himself grievously and painfully injured by the
thrusts of the scythe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had the killing
been planned by him, he would have resorted to strategies that would render
minimal any assault on his person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to
the blood stains on the bedding, they could have been from the victim's
backtracking to his own hut after he had lost in the encounter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Anent the unstained and <span class="SpellE">untorn</span>
mosquito net, it is possible that the same had been pre­viously set to one side
when the victim first came down from the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then again testimony as to the non-staining of the net could have been
inaccurate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All told there is no doubt
in <span class="GramE">Our</span> mind that the unlawful aggression came from the
victim, not from the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise note the utter absence of provocation on the part of the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His disclaimer on the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> incident was very mild, and was harmless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time he gave his answer he brandished
no weapon, displayed no belli­gerence.</p>

<p class="BODY">That appellant eventually made use of the knife he was carrying
is to be expected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attacked by a scythe,
he knew bare hands could not stop the assault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His knife then came to his rescue, and pitted against his assailant's
weapon, the knife merely evened up the odds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No person in his right mind can dispute the fact that all things considered,
a scythe may even be more effective, certainly more deadly than a knife.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> We REVERSE and SET ASIDE the decision of the
trial court and hereby ACQUIT the appellant who in killing the victim did so in
legitimate self-defense.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
