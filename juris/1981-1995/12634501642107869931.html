Accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
A. Mosquito is the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court of Appeals will be termed
the Appellate Tribunal; respondent Judge Montano A. Ortiz, as respondent Trial
Judge, and the Municipal Judge, as such.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, the Offended Parties and
the Witnesses seek the reversal of the Decision of the Appellate Tribunal,
upholding the disallowance of the Offended Parties' appeal by the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> (the Trial Court, for short)
in Civil Case No. 1088, entitled "Reynaldo Mosquito, et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alimpoos</span>, et al",
wherein respondent Trial Judge granted the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span>
petition for <i>Habeas</i> <i>Corpus</i> and declared his detention illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also enjoined the prosecution of Criminal
Case No. 458 of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bayugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> (hereinafter called Criminal Case) where the Accused
had been arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Accused was detained by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bayugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, by virtue of a
Warrant of Arrest issued by the Municipal Judge in the Criminal Case, which was
a prosecution for Robbery with Less Serious Physical Injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place allegedly robbed belonged to the
Offended Parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contending that the
Warrant was issued without the observance of the legal requirements for the
issuance thereof, the Accused, then detained, and his wife instituted the <i>Habeas</i>
<i>Corpus</i> case before the Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Named as defendants in the original complaint were the Offended parties
and the Witnesses (as witnesses for the prosecution) all of whom are residents
of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
an amended complaint, the two arresting policemen, the Chief of Police, and the
Municipal Judge were added as co-defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Complaint of the Accused was premised on the alleged
violation of Article 32 (4), (8), (15), (16), (17) and (19) of the Civil Code,
and Article 269 of the Revised Penal Code, by defendants therein who were said
to have been instrumental in causing the detention and arrest of the
Accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It prayed for the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> release from detention, as well as for the
issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction to enjoin the Offended Parties and
the Witnesses, and the Municipal Judge and/or their representatives, from
proceeding with the Criminal Case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Actual, moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs were
also prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Offended Parties and the Witnesses, except Sgt. Pates, were
represented by the law firm of Seno, Mendoza and Associates, with offices
located in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contended that they had nothing to do
with the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> detention and arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Municipal Judge, the Chief of Police, and
Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Libres</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galimba</span>,
who were represented by the Acting Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
City, alleged that the Warrant of Arrest was validly issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Pates was represented by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Igualdad</span> <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, and reiterated
substantially the same defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing in the <i>Habeas</i> <i>Corpus</i> case,
respondent Trial Judge issued the appealed Order (the ORDER, for short), dated
March 26, 1966, declaring the detention of the Accused illegal and granting the
Writ of <i>Habeas</i> <i>Corpus</i> as well as the Preliminary Injunction
prayed for upon the filing of the required bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the ORDER reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring illegal the
detention of plaintiff Reynaldo Mosquito by virtue of a warrant of arrest
issued without the observance of the fundamental legal requirements prior to
the issuance of said Writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition
for habeas corpus is therefore granted and it is hereby ordered that said
detention prisoner be forthwith released from custody, and set at liberty and
that upon the filing of the bond in the amount of P1,000.00 a writ of
preliminary injunction issue restraining the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Bayugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, defendant
Vicente Galicia and the rest of the defendants, their attorneys, agents or
representatives from proceeding with Criminal Case No. 458 entitled 'The People
of the Philippines versus Reynaldo Mosquito et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.',
for the crime of Robbery with Less Serious Physical Injuries, with costs
against the defendants in these habeas corpus and preliminary injunction proceedings.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Acting Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
received copy of said ORDER on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1966</st1:date>, and on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="4">April 1,
 1966</st1:date>, moved for extension of time within which to appeal, but
eventually desisted from doing so.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 4, 1966, counsel for the Offended Parties and the
Witnesses mailed from <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City a Notice of Appeal to
the Court of Appeals stating that:</p>

<blockquote>"Undersigned counsel received a copy of the order only today (<st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1966</st1:date>) which copy was handed
to him by defendant (petitioner) <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alimpoos</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal was opposed by the Accused on the ground that it was
filed beyond the 48-hour <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period within
which to perfect an appeal in <i>Habeas Corpus</i> proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1966</st1:date>,
over the Offended Parties’ objections, respondent Trial Judge dismissed their
appeal thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The notice of appeal of the Provincial Fiscal or of Atty.
Seno for the defendants, having been filed out of time the Order of <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1966</st1:date> granting the habeas
corpus is now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The urgent ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
motion to grant extension to file notice of appeal does not interrupt the
running of the period fixed by law for filing an appeal which is forty-eight
hours from receipt of the order"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No reconsideration was prayed for by the Provincial Fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Offended Parties, however, resorted to a <i>Mandamus</i>
proceeding before the Court of Appeals seek­ing to compel respondent Trial
Judge to give due course to said appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1967</st1:date>,
the Appellate Tribunal,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in CA-G.R. No. 37781-R, denied <i>Mandamus</i> stating in part:</p>

<blockquote>"As the records show that copy of the questioned Order was
received by counsel on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1966</st1:date>,
the notice of appeal was not filed within the 48-hour limit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' appeal was therefore filed out
of time and the judgment has become final.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, this petition is hereby
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioners."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1967</st1:date>, praying that the
Decision of the Appellate Tribunal be set aside and the appeal inter­posed by
the Offended Parties in the Habeas Corpus case be allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We gave due course to the Petition on <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1967</st1:date>, and after the filing of the
respective Briefs, the case was considered submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Offended Parties and the Witnesses pose the following
Assignments of Error:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in finding that 'counsel,'
however, has not presented a shred of proof to bolster his claim of actual
receipt of the order, Annex 'B' on April 4, 1966, save of his own self-serving
assertions, which cannot prevail over the court record, (Annex 1 of Answer)
certified to by the Clerk of Court, bearing the true actual date when the
parties and counsel herein received their corresponding copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same certified true copy of the order
shows that the law office of herein counsel received its copy on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1966</st1:date> not on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1966</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in holding that 'respondent
Judge was fully justified in relying on its own record to determine the date on
which petitioners' counsel received copy of the order, without any proof
thereof, because courts will take judicial notice of its records and of the
facts which the same records establish and which are known to judges by reason
of their judicial functions.'</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in finding that 'as the
records show that copy of the questioned order was received by counsel on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1966</st1:date>, the notice of appeal
was not filed within the 48-hour limit.'</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in finding that 'petitioners'
appeal was, therefore, filed out of time and the judgment has become final.'</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">V</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in denying the Motion for
Reconsideration without requiring the adverse party to answer the said Motion
for Reconsideration.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">VI</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in failing to pass upon the
issues raised in the lager court and in the Court of Appeals."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The technical issue of timeliness of the appeal will first be
considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the Offended
Parties alleges that he received a copy f the ORDER only on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1966</st1:date> from the Offended Party,
<span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alimpoos</span>, who handed
him the copy in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter had received it on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel contends that the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period to appeal can not be reckoned from the latter date because, under the
Rules, when a party is represented by counsel, notice should be sent, not to
the party, but to his counsel of record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel for the Offended Parties and the Witnesses further maintains
that the period from which to reckon the period of appeal should actually be
April 14, 1966 when he actually received, through the mails, his copy of the
ORDER, as shown by the rubber stamp of his office appearing on the upper right
hand corner of a duplicate copy of the ORDER.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Trial Judge and the Appellate Tribunal alike found the
foregoing assertion self-serving and relied instead on the last page of the
ORDER,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
purportedly showing that the law office of counsel for the Offended Parties and
the Witnesses received its copy on March 30, 1966 and not on April 4, 1966,
hence the disallowance of the appeal by respondent Trial Judge, and its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> by the Appellate Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent then that both respondent Trial Judge and the
Appellate Tribunal committed error in holding that the Offended Parties' appeal
was interposed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service on the Offended Party, <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alimpoos</span>, on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1966</st1:date> cannot be deemed as

Under the circumstances, therefore, reliance may be placed on the assertion of
counsel that the Offended Party, <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alimpoos</span>, had given him a copy of the ORDER only on April
4, 1966, which must be deemed as the date of notice to said counsel of the
ORDER.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel lost no time in mailing
his Notice of Appeal on the same day, <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="4">April

Procedurally, the appeal was seasonably filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the Appellate Tribunal had committed error in its
appreciation of the date when the lawyers of the Offended Parties were served
notice of the ORDER, we believe it would not be justifiable to reverse and to
direct respondent Trial Judge to allow the Offended Parties to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, we are opting to render a practical
judgment.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The original and amended complaints filed by
the Offended Parties with the Trial Court contained three causes of action,
principally for <i>Habeas Corpus</i> and for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the proceedings were conducted
purely as a <i>Habeas Corpus</i> case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The original complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1966</st1:date>, and resolved on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1966</st1:date>, in keeping with the "speedy
and effectual" character of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> proceedings.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The ORDER treated the case as exclusively a <i>Habeas Corpus</i>
proceeding, ignoring the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> prayer for
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawyers of the Offended
Parties attempted to appeal from the ORDER in accordance with Section 19 of
Rule 41, captioned "who may appeal in <i>Habeas Corpus</i>
cases".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Appellate Tribunal
resolved the <i>mandamus</i> case as relating to a <i>Habeas Corpus</i> case.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the proceedings before the trial
Court was a <i>Habeas Corpus</i> case, the complaint filed was obviously
defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <i>Habeas Corpus</i>
proceeding is not a suit between parties.</p>

<blockquote>"Not a suit between the parties. - While the issuance of the
writ is to all intents and purposes the commencement of a civil action, a suit,
yet technically the proceedings by Habeas Corpus is in no sense a suit between
private parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an inquisition by
the government, at the suggestion and instance of an individual, most probably,
but still in the name and capacity of the sovereign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be analogized to a proceeding in <span class="SpellE">rem</span> and instituted for the sole purpose of fixing the
status of a person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person
restrained is the central figure in the transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeding is instituted solely for his
benefit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is not designed to obtain
redress against anybody, and as no judgment can be entered against anybody, and
as there is no real plaintiff and defendant, there can be no suit in the
technical sense." (Extraordinary Legal Remedies, Forrest G. Ferris &amp;
Forrest G. Ferris, Jr., p. 28)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Accused, therefore, should have limited his complaint against
the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bayugan</span>, the person having him
in alleged illegal custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the
clear implication in the following provisions of Section 3, Rule 102, which
enumerates what should be set forth in a petition for <i>Habeas Corpus</i>:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 3. <i>Requisites of application <span class="SpellE">therefor</span></i>.
- Application for the writ shall be by petition signed and verified either by
the party for whose relief it is intended, or by some person on his behalf, and
shall set forth:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the person in whose behalf the
application is made is imprisoned or restrained of his liberty;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer or name of the person by whom he
is so imprisoned or restrained; or, if both are unknown or uncertain, such
officer or person may be described by an assumed appellation, and the person
who is served with the writ shall be deemed the person intended;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The place where he is so imprisoned or
restrained, if known;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A copy of the commitment or cause of
detention of such person, if it can be procured without impairing the
efficiency of the remedy; or, if the imprisonment or restraint is without any
legal authority, such fact shall appear."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> allegation as to, and
prayer for, damages was out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
<i>Habeas Corpus</i> cases, the judgment in favor of the applicant cannot
contain a provision for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
to be confined to what is provided for in Section 15, Rule 102, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 15. <i>When prisoner discharged if no appeal</i>. - When
the court or judge has examined into the cause of caption and restraint of the
prisoner, and is satisfied that he is unlawfully imprisoned or restrained, he
shall forthwith order his discharge from confinement, but such discharge shall
not be effective until a copy of the order has been served on the officer or
person detaining the prisoner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
officer or person detaining the prisoner does not desire to appeal, the
prisoner shall be forthwith released."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be observed that there is no provision for serving copy
of the discharge on any other private party defendant, nor for an award of
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it has been held:</p>

<blockquote>"The sole function of the writ is to relieve from unlawful
imprisonment, and ordinarily it cannot properly be used for any other
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it has been held that the
writ cannot properly be used:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To enforce
a right to service; to determine whether a person has committed a crime; to
determine a disputed interstate boundary line; to punish respondent, or to
afford the injured person redress, for the illegal detention; to recover <i>damages
or other money award</i>; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Accused has challenged the personality of
the Offended Parties to interpose the appeal, premised on Section 19 of Rule 41
of the Rules of Court, which provides:</p>

<blockquote><i>SEC. 19. Who may appeal in habeas corpus cases</i>. - The appeal
in habeas corpus cases may be taken in the name of the person detained or of
the officer or person detain­ing him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But if the detention is by reason of civil proceedings the party in
interest or the person who caused the detention shall be entitled to control
the appeal; and if, by virtue of criminal proceedings, the provincial fiscal or
the city fiscal as the case may be, is entitled to control the appeal on behalf
of the government, subject to the right of the Solicitor General to intervene"
(Rule 41)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is indisputable that the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> case arose by
virtue of criminal proceedings in the Criminal Case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision, therefore, it was the Provincial Fiscal who was entitled to control
the appeal on behalf of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, although the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>,
filed a "Motion for Extension of Time to Perfect Appeal" on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1966</st1:date>, he had nevertheless
abandoned the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he take
steps for the reconsideration of respondent Trial Judge's Order of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1966</st1:date> dismissing the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inaction of the Fiscal may
be deemed to have been an admission on his part of the <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriousness</span>
of an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in criminal
proceedings, his sound discretion on the matter should be deemed controlling,
and it has to be held that the Offended Parties were bereft of person­ality to
prosecute the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Noteworthy is the fact that in the instant case, the Offended
Parties had alleged in their Answer<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
that they were not detaining the Accused and had nothing to do with the Warrant
of Arrest issued against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With all
the more reason then that they had no personality to interpose an appeal from a
judicial Order granting the Writ of Habeas Corpus and ordering the release of a
person detained.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has been noted that the <i>ORDER</i>
contains a provision enjoining the prosecution of the Accused in the Criminal
Case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Accused was illegally detained because
he was arrested without a preliminary examination, what should have been done
was to set aside the warrant of arrest and order the discharge of the Accused,
but without enjoining the Municipal Judge from conducting a preliminary examination
and afterwards properly issuing a warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Habeas Corpus</i> proceedings are not
meant to determine criminal responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This principle was enunciated in Lee <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> v.
Collector of Customs, 33 Phil. 329 (1916) where it was said:</p>

<blockquote>"Proceedings in habeas corpus are separate and distinct from
the main case from which the proceedings spring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rarely, if ever, touch the merits of the
case and require no pronounce­ment with respect thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When a preliminary investigation is not held, or is improperly
held, the procedure is not to dismiss the case, or enjoin its prosecution, but
to have the pre­liminary investigation conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in People v. Figueroa, 27 SCRA,
1239, 1247 (1969):</p>

<blockquote>"Assuming that the trial court felt that the accused should
have been given more 'ample chance and opportunity to be heard in the preliminary
investigation', then what it could properly have done, since in its own Order
it recognized that Fiscal Abaca had conducted a preliminary investigation
although 'hurriedly' in its opinion, was not to dismiss the information but to
hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation or require the
fiscal to hold a reinvestigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court, speaking through now Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>, had stressed this as the
proper procedure, pointing out that 'the absence of such investigation did not
impair the validity of the information or otherwise render it defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less did it affect the jurisdiction of
the Court of First Instance over the present case.'"</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, <i>Habeas</i> <i>Corpus</i>
was not the proper remedy for the Accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a case where a warrant of arrest was assailed for an alleged improper
pre­liminary examination, this Court, in Luna v. Plaza, 26 SCRA, 310, 323
(1968), said:</p>

<blockquote>"At any rate, we believe that, if at all, the remedy available
to the petitioner herein, under the circumstances stated in this opinion, is
not a petition for a writ of habeas corpus but a petition to quash the warrant
of arrest or a petition for a reinvestigation of the case by the respondent
Municipal Judge or by the Provincial Fiscal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the general rule that <i>Habeas Corpus</i> should not be
resorted to when there is another remedy available.</p>

<blockquote>"As a general rule, a writ of habeas corpus will not be
granted where relief may be had or could have been procured by resort to
another general remedy, such as appeal or writ of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the existence of another remedy does not
necessarily preclude a resort to the writ of habeas corpus to obtain relief
from illegal detention, especially where the other remedy is deemed not to be
as effective as that of habeas corpus."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Time and again, it has been explained that <i>Habeas Corpus</i>
cannot function as a writ of error.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has further been noted that respondent
Trial Judge erred in adjudging "costs" against defendants in the <i>Habeas
Corpus</i> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When a person
confined under color of proceedings in a criminal case is discharged, the costs
shall be taxed against the Republic"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Accused was charged with Robbery with
Less Serious Physical Injuries in early 1966.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Through the error of the Municipal Judge in issuing the warrant of
arrest without conducting a preliminary examination, the Accused was able to
institute the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> case which has pended to this date, or for
fifteen years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The error of the
Municipal Judge has considerably retarded the turning of the wheels of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be meet to reiterate
the following admonition made in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
Luna-Plaza case:</p>

<blockquote>"We wish to stress, however, that what has been stated in this
opinion is certainly not intended to sanction the return to the former practice
of municipal judges of simply relying upon affidavits or sworn statements that
are made to accompany the complaints that are filed before them, in determining
whether there is a probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That practice is precisely what is sought to
be voided by the amendment of Section 87 (c) of Republic Act 296 (Judiciary Act
of 1948) which requires that before a municipal judge issues a warrant of
arrest he should first satisfy himself that there is a probable cause by
examining the witnesses personally, and that the examination must be under oath
and reduced to writing in the form of searching questions and answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that the purpose of this amendment
is to prevent the issuance of a warrant of arrest against a person based simply
upon affidavits of witnesses who made, and swore to, their statements before a
person or persons other than the judge before whom the criminal complaint is
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We wish to emphasize strict
compliance by municipal or city judges of the provision of Section 87 (c) of
the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended by Republic Act 3828, in order to avoid
malicious and/or unfounded criminal prosecution of persons."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations, it should be practical
to resolve this case in a manner that will not further protract the matter
brought to this instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will not do
merely to reverse and set aside the appealed decision of the Appellate
Tribunal, for it will leave the ORDER of respondent Trial Judge outstanding
with its injunction against the further prosecution f the Criminal Case.</p>
