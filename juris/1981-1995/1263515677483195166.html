				<H3>ENRICO MANUEL, THE DIRECTOR OF MINES AND THE SECRETARY OF
NATURAL RESOURCES, PETITIONER, VS. THE INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE
COURT, UNITED PARACALE MINING CO., COCO

				<BR><STRONG>VITUG, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>On 27 May 1975, herein private respondents United Paracale Mining
Co., Coco Grove, Inc., and Marsman &amp; Company, Inc., filed a petition to
quiet title before the trial court over certain mining claims so designated as
&quot;Paracale Fraction No. 3,&quot; &quot;Paracale Fraction No. 4,&quot;
&quot;Paracale No. 3,&quot; &quot;Paracale No. 5&quot; and &quot;Paracale No.
1,&quot; which were alleged to have been located in 1933 and 1934 under the
provisions of the Philippine Bill of 1902.  These mining claims were operated by private respondents up until the
start of World War II.  After the war,
private respondents reconstituted the records of the mining claims.<span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The filing of the petition to quiet title was precipitated by an
application, made on 24 August 1973, by private petitioner Enrico Manuel for a
lease contract over a mining claim, denominated &quot;Clement 1,&quot; which
was said to overlap private respondents' mining claims.  On 10 September 1973, private respondents
applied for an order, which was granted, to have their claims surveyed
preparatory to the filing of their patent application.  Following the survey, private respondents
applied for a patent with the Bureau of Mines.</p>

<p class=BODY>The trial court ruled in favor of private respondents and held
that the Director of Mines had no jurisdiction to entertain the lease
application of Manuel.  It rationalized
that the mining claims of private respondents had already become private
property under the provisions of Philippine Bill of 1902, Section 45 of which
law provided:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 45.  That where
such person or association, they and their grantors have held and worked their
claims for a period equal to the time prescribed by the statute of limitations
of the Philippine Islands, evidence of such possession and working of the
claims for such period shall be sufficient to establish a right to a patent
thereto under this act, in the absence of any adverse claim.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Manuel appealed to the Intermediate
Appellate Court (Court of Appeals).  In
a decision, dated 01 August 1984, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of
the trial court.  Manuel's motion for
reconsideration was denied.</p>

<p class=BODY>The instant petition of Manuel (who also brought in the Director
of Mines and the Secretary of Natural Resources as co-petitioners) raised
substantially the same issues already passed upon by this Court, in its
decision, promulgated on 07 April 1993, in G.R. No. 63786-87, entitled
&quot;United Paracale Mining Company, Inc. and Coco Grove, Inc. vs. Hon.
Joselito De la Rosa.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"

There, herein private respondents United Paracale Mining Company, Inc., and
Coco Grove, Inc., sought to set aside the order of dismissal of their ejectment
case against various defendants who had occupied the mining claims asserted to
be privately owned by said respondents under the provisions of the Philippine
Bill of 1902 and Act No. 624.  The point
of controversy, the Court there said, reverberated to the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>question of the constitutionality of
Presidential Decree 1214.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"

style='font-size:13.0pt'> </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>this
Court then ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;x x x (W)e hold <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>that </span>Presidential
Decree No. 1214 is not unconstitutional.  It is a valid exercise of the sovereign power of the State, as owner,
over lands of the public domain, of which petitioner's mining claims still form
a part, and over the patrimony of the nation, of which mineral deposits are a
valuable asset.  It may be underscored,
in this connection, that the Decree does not cover all mining claims located
under the Phil. Bill of 1902, but only those claims over which their locators
had failed to obtain a patent.  And even
then, such locators may still avail of the renewable twenty-five year (25)
lease prescribed by Pres. Decree No. 463, the Mineral Development Resources
Decree of 1974.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Mere location does not mean absolute ownership over the affected
land or the mining claim.  It merely
segregates the located land or area from the public domain by barring other
would-be locators from locating the same and appropriating for themselves the
minerals found therein.  To rule
otherwise would imply that location is all that is needed to acquire and
maintain rights over a located mining claim.  This, we cannot approve or sanction because it is contrary to the
intention of the lawmaker that the locator should faithfully and consistently
comply with the requirements for annual work and improvements in the located
mining claim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Presidential Decree No. 1214 is in accord with Sec. 8, Art.
XIV of the 1973 Constitution which states:</blockquote>

<p class=2Q>&quot;'All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal,
petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries,
wildlife, and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the
State.  With the exception of
agricultural, industrial or commercial, re<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>s</span>idential
and resettlement lands of the public domain, natural resources shall not be
alienated, and no license, concession, or lease for the exploration,
development, and exploitation, or utilization of any of the natural resources
shall be granted for a period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for to more
than twenty-five years, except as to water rights for irrigation, water supply,
fisheries, or industrial uses other than development of water power, in which
cases, beneficial use may be the measure and the limit of the grant.'<span
style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;The same constitutional mandate is found in Sec. 2, Art. XII
of the 1987 Constitution, which declares:</blockquote>

<p class=2Q>&quot;'All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal,
petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries,
forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are
owned by the State.  With the<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> exception of agricultural lands, all other
natural </span>resources shall not be alienated.  The exploration, development, and utilization of natural
resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State.'&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, private respondents' claim of ownership over the mining
claims on the basis merely of their being located under the Philippine Bill of
1902 cannot be sustained, and we must hold the declaration of ownership of the
mining claims made by the courts below in favor of private respondents to be
without legal effect.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned decision of the Court of
Appeals, affirming that of the court <u>a quo</u>, is hereby REVERSED.  No special pronouncement on costs.<span

P.D. 1214 issued by then President Marcos on 14 October 1977 required all
locators under the Act of Congress of 01 July 1902 to secure mining lease
contracts under the provisions of P.D. No. 463 involving their patentable
mining claims.  Section 1 thereof
decreed -</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Section 1.  Holders of subsisting and valid patentable
mining claims, lode or placer, located under the provisions of the Act of
Congress of July 1, 1902, as amended, shall file a mining lease application
therefor with the Mines Regional Office concerned within a period of one (1)
year from the approval of this Decree, and upon the filing thereof, holders of
the said claims shall be considered to have waived their rights to the issuance
of mining patents therefor:  Provided,
however, That the non-filing of the application for mining lease by the holders
thereof within the period herein prescribed shall cause the forfeiture of all
his rights to the claim.&quot;</p>
