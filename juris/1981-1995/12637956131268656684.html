<p class="BODY">This is an appeal brought by the accused Carlos Dolor and <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> from the decision 
of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City, Branch 
XV, finding them and a Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentencing each one of them to 
suffer the penalty of<em> reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of 
the victim <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the costs.</p>
<p class="BODY">The amended information filed against the accused alleged:</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"That on or about April 22, 1973, in 
the afternoon, at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> Mao, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Kauran</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Ampatuan</span>, 
Province of <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this HONORABLE COURT, said accused armed with a deadly bladed 
weapon, a long knife, and with the intent to kill, conspiring, confederating and 
helping each other, did then and there, with treachery and evident 
premeditation, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously 
attack, assault and stab one CELSO ELEVENCIONADO, hitting him fatally with 
mortal wounds in different parts of his body which directly caused his death on 
the spot.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"CONTRARY TO 
LAW."</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The trial court's findings of the indisputable or admitted facts 
are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [T]hat on 
or about April 22, 1973 at Lower Mao, a drinking tuba party was held at the 
house of <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> Dolor and those who were present 
were:<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>, Tony, <span class="SpellE">Gaudincio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Deemoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Monoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span>, Carlos Dolor, <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span>

afternoon, an incident took place which resulted in the death of the victim 
<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> who 
suffered wounds or injuries as follows:<span>&nbsp; </span>'stab wounds at the level 
<span>of </span>11th rib lateral to mid line going front and inward penetrating 
stomach with contents coming out from wound entrance about 3 inches long; stab 
wound 2/3 inches long and 3 inches deep towards wound 1 going upward; 4 small 
lacerated wounds on the forearm; small superficial lacerated wounds level of 
10th rib mid <span class="SpellE">auxillary</span> line'.<span>&nbsp; </span>That 
accused Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> admitted sole responsibility in 
the killing of the victim <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> in self defense."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the trial court went on to establish the guilt beyond 
reasonable doubt of the accused based on the prosecution evidence as 
follows:</p>

accused <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span>, 
Carlos Dolor and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Dionson</span> were already waiting 
for 2 1/2 to 3 hours at the <span class="SpellE">mitan-ag</span> tree just after 
the victim <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> left the place of the drinking spree for home 
to rest.<span>&nbsp; </span>At more or less 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same 
day, when <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> was on his way to the place where his <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> were being pastured by <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> and his sister 
<span class="SpellE">Darlyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanlit</span>, formerly 
<span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>, after waking up from his afternoon rest 
saw the three accused, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carlos Dolor, <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Dionson</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>, after sensing the bad intention of the three 
accused immediately raised his hands and shirt in surrender saying:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>'I will not fight you' and that he was unarmed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite 
<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado's</span> sign 
of surrender, the three accused, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carlos Dolor, <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Dionson</span> suddenly and without any provocation helped one 
another in boxing and mauling the victim <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The three accused, not 
satisfied with their superiority in number still called for Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> who was at that time still drinking tuba at <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> Dolor's place and who, because of ascendancy of 
Carlos Dolor over Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span>, the latter having 
worked with him for five (5) years, without thinking, assaulted, attacked and by 
the aid of the three, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carlos Dolor and <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> who held both arms 
of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> and 
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Dionson</span> who held <span class="SpellE">Celso's</span> feet which caused him to fall with face towards the 
earth, Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> several times 
on the different parts of his body which caused his death.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The lower court rendered its decision against Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> and herein appellants, Carlos Dolor and <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span>, as Roberto <span class="SpellE">Dionson</span> remained at large.</p>
<p class="BODY">The accused, Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span>, withdrew his 
appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY">Appellants Dolor and <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> raised the 
following assignments of errors in this appeal:</p>
<ol><li><span></span>The Lower Court erred in its findings that there was conspiracy 
between the accused resulting to the death of the deceased.<br><br></li><li>The Lower Court erred in denying the defense of Alibi.<br><br></li><li>The facts of the case do not warrant the conviction of the 
accused.<br><br></li><li>The guilt of the accused was not proved beyond reasonable 
doubt.<o:p></o:p></li></ol>
<p class="BODY">The appellants contend that, contrary to the finding of the lower 
court, there was no conspiracy among the accused to kill <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They relied heavily on the testimony of their co-accused Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> who stated that the three persons:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Roberto <span class="SpellE">Dionson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> and Carlos Dolor 
had no participation in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> 
(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tns</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="2">February 11, 
1985</st1:date>, p. 35).<span>&nbsp; </span>Such statement, they allege, gives 
credence to their defense of alibi.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, they put up the 
defense that they had <span class="GramE">no</span> motive for killing the 
deceased.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find no reason to depart from the lower court's appreciation of 
the evidence presented which established conspiracy.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
appellants were positively identified by the victim's children namely:<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Nida</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Darlyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> as among 
those who acted in concert against their father.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Tamba's</span> testimony exculpating them from the misdeed, their 
defense of alibi and their alleged lack of motive cannot overcome the evidence 
on record clearly establishing the identities of the appellants as two of the 
assailants of <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, G.R. No. 52230, 
Dec. 15, 1986; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Ibal</span>, G.R. Nos. 66010-12, 
July 31, 1986).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The appellants question the application of the rule that if the 
only defense of the accused is alibi then this defense is weak if they are 
positively identified.<span>&nbsp; </span>They state that it should not be applied 
when, aside from alibi, the accused has also other defenses as in the case at 
bar (Appellants' brief, p. 8).<span>&nbsp; </span>This contention is not 
meritorious.</p>
<p class="BODY">The accused Dolor claimed that while it is true that he attended 
the drinking spree at <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> Dolor's house, he left 
the place at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 to 2:30 
o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon and went directly home to <span class="SpellE">Kauran</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the accused <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> who incidentally did not take the witness <span class="GramE">stand,</span> relied only on the claims of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Barometro</span>, accused <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span>, and 
Dolor to prove his non-participation and the allegation that he was in his farm 
planting corn (Lower Court Decision, p. 41).</p>
<p class="BODY">As quoted in the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span></u>, <u>supra</u>, from the case of <u>People v. 
<span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span></u> (28 SCRA 765):</p>
<blockquote>"Alibi is one of the weakest defenses that can be resorted to by an 
accused (People v. De la Cruz, 76 Phil. 701).<span>&nbsp; </span>To establish it, the 
accused must show that he was at some other place for such a period of time that 
it was impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was 
committed at the time of its commission (U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Oxiles</span>, 20 Phil. 587; People v. <span class="SpellE">Palomos</span>, 49 Phil. 601; People v. <span class="SpellE">Resabal</span>, 50 Phil. 780). <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The lower court in this case aptly pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span>xxx<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"It will be noted from the testimony of Carlos Dolor that he is a 
resident of <span class="SpellE">Kauran</span> which is more or less 2 kilometers 
to Lower Mao which distance can be easily traversed by walking considering that 
in his defense he went home between 2:00 to 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon and 
the incident took place at about 4:00 o'clock on the same afternoon.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>On the part of <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span>, the place where he went to after asking permission 
from <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> was 
in his farm to plant corn and the distance of his farm is so near that it can 
even be seen from the place where the drinking spree was held, at the house of 
<span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> Dolor.<span>&nbsp; </span>Considering the distance, 
the proximity of the places where the accused Carlos Dolor and <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span> were to the scene 
of the crime does not preclude the possibility that they were at the place of 
the crime at the time when it was committed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore the defense 
cannot be acceptable because the accused can still be in the place at the time 
of the incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>That it is not so far located at a distance that 
it was well-nigh impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Alibi is too weak to prevail over the positive identification by the 
prosecution witnesses as authors of the crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no ground 
to suspect that the three eye witnesses are actuated by sinister or ulterior 
motives in falsifying the truth knowing fully well that one of the accused in 
the person of Carlos Dolor was the <em>compare </em>of their father, the late 
<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>We can only conclude that their intention is solely to bring all those 
who participated in the killing of their father before the bar of justice."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The appellants further contend that they had no motive for killing 
<span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">As held in the case of <em>People v. Cabanit</em> (139 SCRA 
94):</p>
<blockquote>"Proof to establish motive for the killing of the victims in this 
case is of little significance because as stated in <em>People v. Lumantas</em>, 
28 SCRA 764, even lack of motile for committing the crime does not preclude 
conviction when the crime and the participation of the accused therein are 
definitely shown."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The testimony of the victim's son, <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span> shows there was bad blood between his 
father and <span class="SpellE">Gerondio</span> <span class="SpellE">Destor</span>, 
who felt insulted when <span class="SpellE">Nilo's</span> father abruptly rejected 
an offer to buy his plow as the price was too cheap.</p>
<p class="BODY">At any rate, the viciousness of the attack and the fact that three 
of the accused waited for about three hours in some sort of ambush renders 
unnecessary the need to prove their motive.</p>
<p class="BODY">Conspiracy is evident from the manner the accused committed the 
crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>The appellants held the victim's arms while <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> stabbed the victim repeatedly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each of 
the offenders performed with such closeness and coordination as to indicate a 
common purpose or design (<em>People v. Mahusay</em>, 138 SCRA 452).</p>
<p class="BODY">Where there is conspiracy, a showing as to who inflicted the fatal 
blow is not required.<span>&nbsp; </span>As conspirators, the appellants would still 
be equally responsible for the acts of their co-conspirators.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
fact, the appellants were the ones who called on <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span> 
(the person who stabbed the victim) to join them while mauling <span class="SpellE">Elevencionado</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED with the 
MODIFICATION that the indemnity to be paid is increased to THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS 
(P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>).</p>
<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE"><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.</span></p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Padilla, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span>
