				<H3>STAR FORWARDERS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. HON. MIGUEL R. NAVARRO, PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH XXXI OF THE CFI OF MANILA, ALLIED BANKING CORPORATION AND GENERAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MEDIALDEA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i><u>certiorari</u></i> seeking
to annul the orders of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1977</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as culled from the pleadings, are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 14, 1974, petitioner Star Forwarders, Inc. (SFI) filed
a complaint against private respondent General Bank and Trust Company (GENBANK)
for breach of <span class="GramE">contract</span> and damages, docketed as Civil
Case No. 95027 before the then Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch
XXXI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint contained the
following allegations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that on April 26,
1974, for valuable consideration, GENBANK issued to SFI an irrevocable <span style="">letter of credit (p. 36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)
for P1,773,750.00 payable in eleven equal installments; that, by the terms of
the letter of credit, the payment of each installment shall be made by GENBANK
to SFI against bills of exchange drawn by the latter, without </span>recourse,
on the bank's client, <span class="SpellE">Inarda</span> Development <span style="">Corporation (IDC); that, after paying four
installments, GENBANK wrote SFI informing the latter </span>that it had
cancelled the letter <span style="">of </span>credit
on the <span style="">ground that its issuance was
attended by anomalies (p. 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>); that on August
13, 1974, SFI presented to GENBANK a bill of exchange drawn on IDC which GENBANK
refused to honor; and that the failure of </span>GENBANK to comply with its
obligations under the <span style="">irrevocable
letter of credit caused SFI actual and compensatory damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With prior leave of court, SFI filed an amended complaint (pp.
30-35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) <span class="SpellE">impleading</span>
private respondent Allied Banking Corporation (ALLIED) as an additional
defendant on the allegation that the <span style="">latter,
by virtue of an agreement with, or authority given by the Central Bank and/or
GENBANK had acquired all the assets and assumed all the liabilities of GENBANK,
and that, in the alternative possibility that its liabilities were not assumed,
the transfer of assets was in fraud of creditors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, SFI prayed that private
respondents be ordered to comply with the letter of credit, to pay damages,
expenses of litigation and costs of suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer to the complaint (pp. 40-46, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
GENBANK admitted the genuineness of the irrevocable letter of credit but
averred, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the same was
secured through fraud and serious misrepresentation committed by IDC in
connivance with the then incumbent manager of its (GENBANK) Roosevelt Branch in
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City, and that </span><span style="">subject </span><span style="">letter of credit was not supported by any sufficient and valuable
consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, ALLIED filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint (pp. 47-53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) based on the grounds
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the complaint states no cause
of action against it, and (2) the court has <span style="">no </span>jurisdiction over <span style="">the </span>subject
matter of the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">second g</span><span style="">round for dismissal was invoked since on March 25, 1977, the Monetary
Board of the Central Bank, by virtue </span>of <span style="">the authority vested </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">under Republic Act No. 265 (Central Bank Act) </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">amended by Presidential Decree No. 1007, issued Resolution No. 675
forbidding </span><span style="">GENBANK </span><span style="">to do business in the Philippines and at the </span>same
time designating Mr. <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Aurellano</span>,
Assistant to the Governor of the Central Bank, as liquidator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1977</st1:date>, the Monetary Board, thru
Resolution No. 677, ordered the <span style="">liquidation
of GENBANK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1,
 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Central
Bank, by the Solicitor General, filed a "Petition for Assistance in the
Liquidation of General Bank and Trust Company" before the Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch IV docketed as </span><span style="">Special Proc. No. </span><span style="">107812,
</span>pursuant to Section 29 <span style="">of </span>Republic
Act No. 265 as amended by Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1007.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the theory that with the declaration of
insolvency <span style="">of GENBANK and the filing in
court of said petition, ALLIED averred that <span class="SpellE">SFI's</span>
claim for breach of contract allegedly committed by GENBANK should be filed and
ventilated in that court (Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch IV).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Opposing the motion to dismiss (pp. 54-58, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
SFI alleged that the determination as to whether or not ALLIED had assumed all
the liabilities of GENBANK can only be made after trial <span style="">on </span>the merits, and that there <span style="">were no insolvency proceedings proper where claims against GENBANK may
be filed and prosecuted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated September 19, 1977 (pp. 59-61, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), the trial court denied the motion to dismiss ruling
that the amended complaint stated a cause of action against the private
respondents and that the alleged existence of an insolvency proceeding wherein <span class="SpellE">SFI's</span> claim should be filed is evidentiary in nature <span style="">which can only be determined after trial on
the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">ALLIED moved for a
reconsideration of the order of denial (pp. 62-66, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)
insisting that jurisdiction to try the instant claim against GENBANK rests with
Branch IV of the Court of First Instance of Manila which is hearing the
petition for insolvency of said bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>SFI opposed the motion for
reconsideration (pp. 67-71, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) on the grounds
that ALLIED cannot invoke the alleged insolvency of GENBANK which can only be
done by the latter and that, even in the case of GENBANK, the special
proceeding instituted by the Solicitor General is not one where the assets of <span style="">GENBANK </span>will be made available for the
satisfaction of its liabilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 18, 1977, the trial court issued an order granting
the motion for reconsideration filed by ALLIED and dismissing the amended
complaint against both private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads <span style="">(pp. </span>84-85,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rollo</span></span><span style="">):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING, the Motion for Reconsideration of the
Order of <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="9">19 September 1977</st1:date>
should be, as it is hereby, granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the said Order is hereby reconsidered and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint is dismissed, without
prejudice to filing the same in the Court in insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without pronouncement as to
costs.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">According to the trial court, upon the
filing of the petition for assistance in the liquidation of GENBANK, the court
wherein it was filed acquires jurisdiction, <span style="">in the same proceeding, to adjudicate disputed claims against the bank
to the exclusion of all other courts and that such defense can be invoked even </span><span style="">by ALLIED </span>since it concerns
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">SFI
</span>moved for a reconsideration <span style="">of </span>said
order (pp. 86-95, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) contending that the special
proceeding adverted <span style="">to </span>is not an
insolvency proceeding and, even if it were, claims already filed and pending in
other courts need not be dismissed as they can be <span style="">defended by </span>the appointed receiver or liquidator.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering said motion for reconsideration, the opposition
thereto <span style="">(pp. 96-102, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), as well as the testimonial and documentary evidence
adduced during the preliminary hearing on the jurisdictional issue, <span style="">the trial court, on July 6, 1978, issued an
order denying the motion </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">reconsideration (pp. 104-105, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the present petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 11, 1989, considering the length of time that this
case has remained pending and as a practical measure to ease the backlog of
this Court, We resolved to require the parties to manifest whether <span style="">or not they are still interested in
prosecuting this case, </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">supervening events have transpired which
render this case academic or otherwise substantially </span>affect the same (p.
<span style="">366, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1990</st1:date>,
SFI manifested that it is not aware of any event subsequent to the filing of
the petition which would render the case academic (pp. <span style="">367-368, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On </span></span><st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="1"><span class="GramE"><span style="">January 15, 1990</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, ALLIED manifested that it has no objection
to the dismissal of this </span>case.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Even if SFI has a valid cause of
action, it should prosecute the same before the court where the petition </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">dissolve GENBANK is still pending (pp. 370-371, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rollo</span></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1990" day="20" month="2"><span style="">February 20, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Solicitor General manifested that he is
</span>not aware of any supervening event <span style="">which
would render the case academic (p. 377, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue presented is whether or not the dismissal of the complaint
filed <span style="">by </span>SFI before the trial
court was proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of this petition, SFI alleges that the "Petition
for Assistance in the Liquidation of General Bank and Trust Company" is
not an insolvency <span style="">proceedings proper
because (1) there </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">no allegation therein surrendering the assets
</span><span style="">of </span><span style="">GENBANK to the court; (2) it does </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">contain any </span><span style="">list </span><span style="">of creditors of GENBANK; and (3) what is being asked is for the court </span>to
see to it that ALLIED would assume all<span style=""> </span>the
liabilities of GENBANK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, there is absolutely no sense in holding that a complaint for the
enforcement of the liability of GENBANK which is already being prosecuted in
the proper <span style="">court </span>(Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch XXXI) not only against it but also against ALLIED which
assumed such liability should be dismissed in order to be prosecuted solely
against GENBANK in another court (Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch
IV).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, <span style="">SFI </span>asserts that the <span style="">case </span>of
Hernandez, et al. v. Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc., et
al., G.R. No. L-29791, January 10, 1978, 81 SCRA 75 invoked by both the
Solicitor General and ALLIED is not applicable because the facts therein are
different from the facts <span style="">in </span>the
case <span style="">at </span>bar, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) there was an insolvency proceedings
proper the purpose of which was to convert the assets of the bank into cash for
distribution to its creditors; (2) the case that was filed <span style="">in </span>another court was for consignation,
the determination of which requires an examination of the <span style="">books </span>of accounts of the insolvent bank
and those books were already turned over to the receiver appointed by <span style="">the Central Bank pursuant to an order of the
insolvency court, and (3) the insolvency proceedings was already pending when
the </span><span style="">action </span><span style="">for consignation was filed by Hernandez </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">another court and such fact was known to Hernandez.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From a perusal of the allegations of SFI, it is at once
discernible that it does not argue squarely against the dismissal of its
complaint by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>not for <span class="GramE">Us</span>
to rule in this petition on the merits <span style="">of
</span>the proceedings before Branch IV of the Court of First Instance of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, <span class="GramE">Our</span>
concern here is regarding jurisdiction over the action filed by SFI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of <span class="SpellE">SFI's</span>
complaint by the trial court <span style="">finds
support both in law and jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 29 of Republic Act No. 265 as amended by Section 1 of
Presidential Decree No. 1007 provides, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the Monetary Board shall determine and confirm within the said
period that the banking institution is insolvent or cannot resume business with
safety to its depositors, creditors and the general public, it shall, if the
public interest requires, order its liquidation, indicate <span style="">the </span>manner of its liquidation and approve
a liquidation plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Central Bank <span style="">shall, </span>by the Solicitor General, file
a petition <span style="">in </span>the Court of First
Instance reciting the proceedings which have been taken and praying the
assistance of the court in the liquidation of the banking institution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>court</u> <u>shall</u> <u>have</u>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The records readily reveal that the claim
of SFI is a disputed claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GENBANK, in
its answer to the complaint filed by SFI before the trial court stated, among
other things, "[t]hat the letter of credit on question was secured through
fraud and serious misrepresentations <span style="">committed
by the applicant <span class="SpellE">Inarda</span> Development Corporation, in
connivance with the then incumbent Manager of Defendant's Roosevelt Branch in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, who taking undue advantage of his position
fraudulently manipulated the transaction, with </span>the <span style="">knowledge and consent of plaintiff (SFI) as
beneficiary, resulting in the issuance of the Letter of Credit, to the damage
and prejudice of defendant (GENBANK)" (p. 42, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision, the Court of First Instance where the "Petition for Assistance
in the Liquidation of General Bank and Trust Company" was filed has the
jurisdiction to resolve said claim which, in this case, is Branch IV of the
Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rationale behind this provision is set forth in the "whereas" clauses
of Presidential Decree No. 1007:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS,<span style=""> </span>where a bank
has become insolvent or can not continue to resume business with safety to its
depositors and other creditors, its assets must be preserved and its debts and
accounts settled as <u><span style="">expeditiously</span></u><span style=""> </span>as possible; and<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"WHEREAS, the action of the Central Bank in
connection with the above should not be hampered by unnecessarily <u>tedious</u>
<u>and</u> <u>protracted</u> <u>court</u> <u>litigations</u>.”</span> (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Along the same line as these reasons are
considerations <span style="">of </span><span style="">practicality and necessity, and to </span><span style="">prevent </span><span style="">multiplicity of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
it </span>will <span style="">be burdensome on the
part of the liquidator if he were to appear before several courts to litigate
claims against the insolvent bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resolving a similar issue, We said in the case of Hernandez, et al. v.
Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc., et al., <u>supra</u>,
that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
liquidation court or the Manila court has exclusive jurisdiction to entertain
the claim of the Hernandez spouses that their mortgage obligation had already
been extinguished by means of their tender of the check issued by the </span>San
<span style="">Pablo Colleges." While We concede
that the facts of the Hernandez case are not on all fours with the present case
yet, what is controlling is Our ruling therein that convenience and
practicality are </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">overriding considerations in vesting
exclusive jurisdiction o</span>n <span style="">the
liquidation court to entertain the claim of the Hernandez spouses, and which We
are simply reiterating now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The notion of SFI that the suit to be filed before the
liquidation court will only be against GENBANK is incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will also be a suit against ALLIED since, <span style="">and </span>as <span style="">S</span>FI is <span style="">very much aware,
it (ALLIED) had assumed all the obligations of GENBANK, as evidenced by
Resolution No. 677 (p. 77, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>):<o:p></o:p></span></p>
