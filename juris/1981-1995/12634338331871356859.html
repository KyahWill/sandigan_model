				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In its resolution of May 13, 1992, the First Division of this
Court referred <u>en</u> <u>consulta</u> to the Court En Banc the question as

Article 315 of the <span style="">Revised Penal Code
and </span>sentenced therefore to serve twenty-two years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,

which under the law ex<span style="">i</span>sting at
the time of its commission and at the time of the application for bail is
punishable by a penalty lower than <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> and is out
on bail, and after trial is convicted by the trial court of the offense charged
or of a lesser offense than that charged in the complaint or information, he
may be allowed to remain free on his original bail pending the resolution of
his appeal, unless the proper court directs otherwise pursuant to Rule 114,

under the law at the time of its commission and at the time of the application
for bail is punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> and is out on bail,
and after trial is convicted by the trial court of a lesser offense than that
charged in the complaint or information, the same rule set forth in the

resolution of his appeal.'</p>

<blockquote>"As to criminal cases covered under the third rule above

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">1)  This Court shall order the bondsman <span style="">to </span>surrender <span style="">the </span>accused, within ten (10) days from notice, to the court of

be dismissed under Section 8, Rule 124 of the Revised Rules of Court as he
shall be deemed <span style="">to </span>have jumped
bail."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases at bar, appellant was charged in the Regional Trial
Court of Manila, Branch 37, in three cases for violations of Batas Pambansa
Blg. 22<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

cases were jointly tried and a decision thereon was rendered by Judge Angelina
S. Gutierrez on March 12, 1991.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the three cases for violations of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22,
appellant was convicted and sentenced to a total penalty of two years of imprisonment
and to pay a total fine of P96,290.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the two indictments for estafa, in Criminal Case No. 86-51209
she was found guilty and sentenced to twenty-two years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
with its accessory penalties, to indemnify the complaining witness in the sum
of P80,540.00 and to pay the costs; and in Criminal Case No. 86-51210, she was
likewise convicted and imposed an indeterminate sentence of six years and one
day of <u><span style="">prision</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to fourteen
years, eight months and one day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as
maximum, together with the accessory penalties, as well as to indemnify the
offended party in the sum of P15,750.00 and to pay the costs.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Elevated to the Court of Appeals for appellate review, said cases
were forwarded by said court to this Court in view of the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u> involved therein.  In
the meantime, it appears that appellant is under provisional liberty on bail in
the aforesaid criminal cases, including Criminal Case No. 86-51209, under a corporate
surety bond posted by Oriental Assurance Corporation in the amount of
P86,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court notes that said bond was provided <span style="">pursuant </span>to the order of the trial court dated May 16, 1991,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
hence prior <span style="">to our resolution of
October 15, 1991 </span>quoted <u>in</u> <u>limine</u>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the issue presented now is whether, under the
considerations in the foregoing discussion, appellant should be permitted to
remain on bail.  A chronological
flashback into the constitutional and statutory changes relevant to this issue,
in juxtaposition with the state of the penal laws during the periods material
thereto, would accordingly be desirable and instructive.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 22, 1975, Presidential Decree No. 818 introduced the
following <span style="">amendment </span>to Article
315 of the Revised Penal Code:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.  Any person
who shall defraud another by means of false pretenses or fraudulent acts as
defined in paragraph 2(d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended
by Republic Act No. 4885, shall be punished by:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1st.  The penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not
exceed 22,000 pesos, and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty
provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one
year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be
imposed shall in no case exceed thirty years.  In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may
be imposed under the Revised Penal Code, the penalty shall be termed <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>;"<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Preliminarily, it may be asked whether
a penalty higher than <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> but less than thirty
(30) years may properly be categorized and considered as embraced within the
penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, as has been provided in said amendatory
decree, the common praxis being to attribute to <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
and the other perpetual penalties a duration of thirty (30) years.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">We hold that there is legal basis, both
in law <span style="">and logic, for </span>Presidential
Decree No. 818 to declare that any penalty exceeding twenty (20) years, or the
maximum duration of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, is within the range of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It will be observed that Article 27 of the Code<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
provides for the minimum and maximum ranges of all the penalties in the Code
(except bond to keep the peace which shall be for such period of time as the
court may determine) from <u>arresto</u> <u>menor</u> to <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
the latter being specifically from twelve years and one day to twenty
years.  For <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,
however, there is no specification as to its minimum and maximum range, as the
aforesaid article merely provides that "(a)ny person sentenced to any of
the perpetual penalties shall be pardoned after undergoing the penalty for
thirty years, unless such person by reason of his conduct or some other serious
cause shall be considered by the Chief Executive as unworthy of pardon."</p>

<p class="BODY">The other applicable reference to <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
is found in Article 70 of the Code which, in laying down the rule on successive
service of sentences where the culprit has to serve more than three penalties,
provides that "the maximum duration of the convict's sentence shall not be
more than three-fold the length of time corresponding to the most severe of the
penalties imposed upon him," and "(i)n applying the provisions of
this rule the duration of perpetual penalties (<u>pena</u> <u>perpetua</u>)
shall be computed at thirty years."</p>

<p class="BODY">The imputed duration of thirty (30) years for <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,
therefore, is only to serve as the basis for determining the convict's
eligibility for pardon or for the application of the three-fold rule in the
service of multiple penalties.  Since,
however, in all the graduated scales of penalties in the Code, as set out in
Articles 25, 70 and 71, <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> is the penalty
immediately next higher to <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, it follows by
necessary implication that the minimum of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> is
twenty (20) years and one (1) day with a maximum duration thereafter to last
for the rest of the convict's natural life although, pursuant to Article 70, it
appears that the maximum period for the service of penalties shall not exceed
forty (40) years.  It would be legally
absurd and violative of the scales of penalties in the Code to reckon the minimum
of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> at thirty (30) years since there would
thereby be a resultant lacuna whenever the penalty exceeds the maximum twenty
(20) years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> but is less than thirty (30)
years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the main issue now, it will be recalled that before the
ratification of the present Constitution on February 2, 1987, the rule on
non-bailability of a criminal offense was singularly in the case of a capital
offense where the evidence of guilt is strong.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>  Thus, as late as the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure effective on January 1, 1985, bail was a matter of right, except <span style="">in </span>a capital offense when the evidence
of guilt thereof is strong<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> and,
following the traditional concept, a capital offense, as the term is used in
said Rules, is an offense which, under the law existing at the time of its
commission and at the time of the application to <span style="">be admitted to </span>bail, may be punished with death.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Offenses punishable with </span><u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>, <span style="">were accordingly bailable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the prohibition in
the 1987 </span>Constitution against <span style="">the
imposition of the death penalty,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>a correlative <span style="">provision therein </span><span style="">categorically
declared </span>the unavailability of bail to <span style="">persons charged with </span>offenses punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
<span style="">when the evidence </span>of guilt is
strong.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Correspondingly, the </span><span style="">aforecited </span>Section 3 of Rule 114 was <span style="">amended to </span><span style="">provide </span><span style="">that no </span>bail
shall be granted to those charged with "an offense which, under the law at
the time of its commission and at the time of the application for bail, is
punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, when evidence of guilt is
strong."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">There can be </span>no pretense that
such unequivocal and explicit <span style="">provisions
in </span>the Constitution and the Rules of Court would <span style="">admit </span>of any exception, qualification or distinction.</p>

<p class="BODY">With such developmental antecedents, it may not be said that the
framers of the 1987 Constitution, a number of whom were lawyers and who can
plausibly be credited even by the censorious with at least a working knowledge
of criminal law and procedure, were unaware of the felonies under the Revised
Penal Code which were already punishable with the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
and which, with the amendments introduced by the present Constitution, would
become non-bailable offenses as a consequence.  Specifically with respect to the offense of estafa involved in the
present case, the members of the Constitutional Commission could not have been
oblivious of Presidential Decree No. 818, which took effect as early as 1975
and was given extensive media coverage at the instance or with the cooperation
of the banking community, providing for the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
where bouncing checks of the requisite amount are involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">For that matter, as will hereafter be demonstrated, there are
other crimes involving government and private funds or property which
theretofore were also already punished with <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.  Hence, under the rule of <u>contemporanea</u>
<u>expositio</u> and since the felony of estafa was not expressly or impliedly
excluded from the aforestated provisions on nonÂ­-bailability, we see no reason
why an accused charged with estafa punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
should now be given the exceptional and favored treatment of being admitted to
bail.  The same may be said of any
accused charged with any offense so punished, whether the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u> is by direct statutory prescription or is imposed as a
consequence of the interplay of related provisions of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is suggested that since estafa is a crime against property and
supposedly not as "heinous" as crimes against persons or chastity,
such as murder or rape, it should not be equated with the latter felonies in
justifying the denial of bail to the accused.  From the preceding disquisition, the obvious riposte is that this is a
matter which should properly be addressed to the legislature.  It is not for this Court, by judicial
legislation, to amend the pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal Code, much
less the Constitution.  Nor is it for us
to intrude into the policy considerations, absent blatant abuse of legislative
power or capricious exercise thereof, which impelled the legislative
categorization of an offense as being so abominable or execrable as to call for
a denial of the right to bail.  On this
score, we can take judicial notice that multimillion or large-scale estafa
cases and inveterate or professional swindlers have inflicted untold damages
and misery not only on one or two but on countless victims in this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will further be observed that Presidential Decree No. 818 does
not apply to all forms of estafa but only to estafa by means of deceit under
paragraph 2(d) of Article 315, that is, estafa through the use of so-called
bouncing checks.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The preambular clauses of said decree duly express the rationale for the amendment
introduced thereby in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, reports received of late indicate an upsurge of
estafa (swindling) cases committed by means of bouncing checks;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, if not checked at once, these criminal acts would
erode the people's confidence in the use of negotiable instruments as a medium
of commercial transaction and consequently result in the retardation of trade
and commerce and the undermining of the banking system of the country;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it is vitally necessary to arrest and curb the rise
in this kind of estafa cases by increasing the existing penalties provided
therefor;"</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x  x  x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now, as earlier stated, on analogous considerations in the
formulation of punitive policies, the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
is imposed in one felony under the title on crimes committed by public officers
and in three felonies under the title on crimes against property.  These provisions have been in the Revised
Penal Code long before Presidential Decree No. 818 was effected and may have
been the bases for the amendments introduced by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Thus, in malversation of public funds
or property, if the amount involved exceeds P22,000.00, the penalty shall be <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> in its maximum period to <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In robbery, when by reason or on the occasion of which any of the
physical injuries penalized in subdivision 2 of Article 263 is committed (which
includes mere incapacity from the Victim's habitual work for more than ninety
days), the penalty is <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
However, if in said robbery the property taken is mail matter or large cattle,
the offender shall suffer the penalty next higher in degree, that is, <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the crime of theft, if the value of the thing stolen exceeds
P22,000.00, the penalty shall be <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u> in its maximum
period and one year for each additional P10,000.00, but the total penalty shall
not exceed twenty years or <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
However, if that crime of theft is attended by any of the qualifying
circumstances which convert the taking into qualified theft, the penalty next
higher by two degrees shall be imposed,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> that
is, at least <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The felony of destructive arson, which includes the burning of
any building where people usually gather or congregate for a definite purpose
is now punished by <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its maximum period to
death<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
regardless of the resultant effects or amount of damages.  The same increased penalty is imposed on
other forms of arson formerly defined in paragraph 1(c) and (d) of Article 321,
which have now been incorporated by Presidential Decree No. 1744 in Article 320
as destructive arson, regardless of the damages caused or whether or not the
purpose is attained.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing discussion, it is evident that the legislative
criteria for the imposition of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> in said
offenses took into account not only the inherent odious or outrageous nature of
the crime, such as the taking of a life or an assault against chastity, but
also either the moral depravity or criminal perversity shown by the acts of the
accused, or the necessity for protection of property in the governmental,
financial or economic interests of the country.  The objectives of Presidential Decree No. 818 are indubitably
within the ambit of the same legislative intendment and the foregoing
justifications for the imposition of higher penalties and the consequent denial
of bail to the malefactor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court hereby RESOLVES (1) to ORDER the
bondsman, Oriental Assurance Corporation, to surrender accused-appellant
Cresencia C. Reyes within ten (10) days from notice to the Regional Trial Court

Art. 310, <i><u>id</u></i>., as amended by B.P. Blg. 71.  Noteworthy, vis-a-vis the justification for
the incremental penalty for estafa by bouncing checks, is that theft is
qualified by the mere fact that it is committed by a domestic servant, or with
grave abuse of confidence, or if the property stolen is motor vehicle, mail
matter or large cattle or consists of coconuts taken from the premises of a
plantation, fish taken from a fishpond or fishery or if property is taken on
the occasion of a calamity, vehicular accident or civil disturbance.</p>
