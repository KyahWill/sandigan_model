				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before Us is a petition to review by <i>certiorari</i> the
decision of the Municipal Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
City, Branch IV, which denied petitioner's motion for subsidiary writ of
execution against the owner-operator of the vehicle which figured in the
accident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are undisputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime on October 23, 1985, accused-respondent Edwin Ramirez,
while driving a passenger Fuso Jitney owned and operated by Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, bumped <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, a pedestrian crossing the street, as a consequence
of which the latter suffered from a fractured left clavicle as reflected in the
medico-legal certificate and sustained injuries which required medical
attention for a period of (3) three months.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">An information</span> for Reckless Imprudence
Resulting to Serious Physical Injuries was filed against Edwin Ramirez with the
<st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Branch IV.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1987</st1:date>, the accused voluntarily pleaded
guilty to a lesser offense and was accordingly convicted for Reckless
Imprudence Resulting to Less Serious Physical Injuries under <span class="GramE">an
amended</span> information punishable under Article 365 of the Revised Penal
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision handed down on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="5">May
 27, 1987</st1:date> reads as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, finding the accused EDWIN RAMIREZ y WEE guilty as
a principal beyond reasonable doubt of the Amended Information to which he
voluntarily pleaded guilty and appreciating this mitigating circumstance in his
favor, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of One (1) month and One (1)
day to Two (2) months of <span class="SpellE">Arresto</span> Mayor in its minimum
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused is likewise ordered
to indemnify the complainant <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> the amount of P45.00 representing the value of the
1/2 can of tomatoes lost; the amount of P200.00 which complainant paid to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
to pay complainant the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> as
attorney's fees and to pay the cost of this suit.</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thereafter, the accused filed an
application for probation.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the early stage of the trial, the private prosecutor
manifested his desire to present evidence to establish the civil liability of
either the accused driver or the owner-operator <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span>the vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> counsel moved that the court summon the owner of
the vehicle to afford the latter a day in court, on the ground that the accused
is not only indigent but also jobless and thus cannot answer any civil
liability that may be imposed upon him by the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private prosecutor, however, did not move
for the appearance of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The civil aspect of the above-quoted decision was appealed by the
private prosecutor to the Regional Trial Court Branch XVI, appellant praying
for moral damages in the amount of P10,000.00, compensatory damages at
P6,186.40, and attorney's fees of P5,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellate court, on January 20, 1988, modified the trial court's
decision, granting the appellant moral damages in the amount of Five Thousand
Pesos (P5,000.00), while affirming all other civil liabilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, a writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1988</st1:date> was duly served upon the accused
but was, however, returned unsatisfied due to the insolvency of the accused as
shown by the sheriff's return.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
complainant moved for a subsidiary writ of execution against the subsidiary
liability of the owner-operator of the vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same was denied by the trial court on two grounds, namely, the
decision of the appellate court made no mention of the subsidiary liability of
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, and the nature of the accident falls
under "culpa-<span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>" and not "culpa-contractual."
A motion for reconsideration of the said order was disallowed for the reason
that complainant having failed to raise the matter of subsidiary liability with
the appellate court, said court rendered its decision which has become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and the trial court has no power to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">alter or modify such decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Hence,
the instant petition.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner relies heavily
on the case of <span class="SpellE">Pajarito</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Seneris</span>,
87 SCRA 275, which enunciates that "the subsidiary liability of the
owner-operator is fixed by the judgment, because if a case were to be filed
against said operator, the court called upon to act thereto has </span>no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">other function than to render a decision
based on the indemnity award in the criminal case </span>without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">power to amend or modify it even if in his
opinion an error has been committed in the decision." Petitioner maintains
that the tenor of the aforesaid decision implies that the subsidiary liability
of the owner-operator may be enforced in the same proceeding and a separate
action is no longer necessary in order to avoid undue delay, notwithstanding
the fact that said employer was not made a party in the criminal action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is the theory of
respondent that the owner-operator cannot be validly held <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable for the following </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">r</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">easons, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the matter of subsidiary liability was
not raised on appeal; (b) contrary to the case of <span class="SpellE">Pajarito</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Seneris</span>, the injuries sustained by the complainant
did not </span>arise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">from the so-called
"culpa-contractual" but from "culpa-<span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>";
(c) the judgments of appellate courts may not be altered, modified, or changed
by the court of origin; and (d) said owner was never made a party to the
criminal proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Thus, the underlying
issue raised in this case is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether or
not the subsidiary liability of the owner-operator may be enforced in the same
criminal proceeding against the driver where the award was given, or in a
separate civil action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The law involved in the
instant case is Article 103 in relation to Article 100, both of the Revised
Penal Code, which reads thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Art. 103.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsidiary
civil liability of other persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
subsidiary liability established in the next preceding article shall apply to
employers, teachers, persons, and corporations engaged in any kind of industry
for felonies committed by their servants, pupils, workmen, apprentices, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">employees in </span>the
discharge of their duties."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Respondent
contends that the case of <span class="SpellE">Pajarito</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Seneris</span> cannot be applied to the present case, the former
being an action involving culpa-contractual, while the latter being one of </span>culpa-<span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a
declaration is erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">subsidiary liability in
Art.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> 103 should be
distinguished from the primary liability of employers, which is quasi-<span class="SpellE">delictual</span> in character as</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">provided </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in Art. <span class="GramE">2180 of the New
Civil Code.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Under
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Art.</span></span></span> 103, the
liability emanated from a <span class="SpellE">delict</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On the other hand, the
liability under Art.</span> 2180 is founded on culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The present case is neither an action for
culpa?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">contractual nor for culpa-<span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
basically an action to enforce the civil liability arising from crime under
Art. <span class="GramE">100 of the Revised Penal Code.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In no case can this be regarded as a civil
action for the primary liability of the employer under Art. <span class="GramE">2180
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">New </span>Civil Code, i.e.,
action for culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In order that an employer may be held <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable for the employee's civil liability in the criminal action, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">it </span>should be shown (1) that the
employer, etc. is engaged in any kind of industry, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">(2) </span>that the employee committed the offense in the discharge of
his duties and (3) that he is insolvent (<span class="SpellE">Basa</span>
Marketing Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>, 117 SCRA 156).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The subsidiary liability of the employer,
however, arises only after conviction of the employee in the criminal
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All <span class="GramE">these
requisites present, the employer becomes</span> ipso facto <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable upon the employee's conviction and upon proof of the latter's
insolvency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the case at
bar satisfies all these requirements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, we are not convinced that the owner-operator has
been deprived of his day in court, because the case before us is not one
wherein the operator is sued for a primary liability under the Civil Code but
one in which the subsidiary civil liability incident to and dependent upon his
employee's criminal negligence is sought to be enforced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the subsidiary liability imposed
upon the employer by law, he is in substance and in effect a party to the
criminal case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ergo, the employer's
subsidiary liability may be determined and enforced in the criminal case as
part of the execution proceedings against the employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court held in the earlier case of <span class="SpellE">Pajarito</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Seneris</span>, supra, that
"The proceeding for the enforcement of the subsidiary civil liability may
be considered as part of the proceeding for the execution of the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A case in which an execution has been issued
is regarded as still pending so that all proceedings on the execution are
proceedings in the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
question that the court which rendered the judgment has a general supervisory
control over its process of execution, and this power carries with it the right
to determine every question of fact and law which may be involved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>the execution."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The argument that the
owner-operator cannot </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">held <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable because the matter of subsidiary
liability was not raised on appeal and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">like manner, the
appellate court's decision made no mention of such subsidiary liability is of
no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As already discussed, the
filing of a separate </span>complaint against the operator for recovery of
subsidiary liability is not necessary since his liability is clear from the
decision against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such being
the case, it is not indispensable for the question of subsidiary liability to
be passed upon by the appellate court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such subsidiary liability is already implied from the appellate court's
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the
recent case of <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> de <span class="SpellE">Paman</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Seneris</span>, 115 SCRA 709, this Court reiterated the
following pronouncement: "A judgment of conviction sentencing a defendant
employer to pay an indemnity in the absence of any collusion between the
defendant and the offended party, is conclusive upon the employer in an action <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the enforcement of the latter's subsidiary liability not only with
regard to the civil liability, but also with regard to its amount." This
being the case, this Court stated in <span class="SpellE">Rotea</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, 109 Phil. 495, that the court has no other function
than to render decision based upon the indemnity awarded in the criminal case
and has no power to amend or modify it even if in </span>its opinion an error
has been committed in the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">separate and independent action <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is, </span>therefore, unnecessary and would
only unduly prolong the agony of the heirs of the victim."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Finally, the position
taken by the respondent appellate court that to grant the motion for subsidiary
writ of execution would in effect <span class="GramE">be</span> to amend its
decision which has already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
cannot be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Compelling the
owner-operator to pay on the basis of his subsidiary liability does not
constitute an amendment of the judgment because in an action under Art. 103 of
the Revised Penal Code, once all the requisites as earlier discussed are met,
the employer becomes <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable, without need of a separate action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such being </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the case, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the subsidiary liability can be enforced in
the </span>same case where the award was given, and this <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">does </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">constitute an act of amending the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It becomes incumbent upon the court to grant
a motion for subsidiary writ of execution (but only after the employer has been
heard), upon conviction of the employee and after <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">execution is </span>returned unsatisfied due to the employee's
insolvency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, the order of respondent court disallowing
