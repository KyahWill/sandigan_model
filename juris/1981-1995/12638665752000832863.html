of the respondent Civil Service Commission in CSC Case No. 31, entitled
“RE:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DE OCERA, RAUL B., Appellant”, the
first dated September 27, 1988, and the second dated November 24, 1988, for
having been issued with grave abuse of <span style="">discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction and in gross violation of the right of
petitioner to due process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The undisputed facts are
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="11"><span style="">November
 1, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner
Jose Cesar D. <span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> was appointed Supervising
Revenue Enforcement Officer of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), pursuant
to the reorganization of the BIR under Executive Order No. 127 dated </span><st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="1"><span style="">January
 20, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointment was actually a reappointment
because prior to the reorganization <span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> was
holding the same position of Supervising Revenue Enforcement Officer assigned
to the Manufacturing Division I by virtue of Revenue Travel Assignment Order
No. 166-87 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 73).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="4"><span style="">April
 28, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, private
respondent Raul de <span class="SpellE">Ocera</span> filed his protest contesting
the appointment of petitioner Jose Cesar D. <span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> as
Supervising Revenue Enforcement Officer on the ground that he has better
qualifications and is more competent than <span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 53; Comment, p. 1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evaluating the protest, Assistant
Commissioner of the BIR, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguas</span>, Section Operations Officer, made the following
comment on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="5"><span style="">May 10, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“In connection with the subject protest, I would like to state for
the record that the <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> meets the standard of
competence and integrity as will be shown by his performance and his spotless
records as a revenue man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A consistent <u>outstanding</u>
<u>achiever</u> in terms of assessment and collection for the last two years,
he is superior to Protestant, who has alternately posted on a ‘satisfactory’ or
‘very satisfactory’ adjectival rating during the same period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Similarly, my evaluation on the parties as to the moral fitness
relevant to the contested position discloses that the <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span>
has an edge because he has not been linked to any anomaly, irregularity, a fact
which cannot be conceded to the Protestant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In sum it is my considered view that between the herein contending
parties, it is the <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> who can better give
substance and dignity to the position, hence, more deserving than Protestant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended that the protest be
dismissed for lack of merit.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 25;
Petition; Annex “C”).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="5"><span style="">May 24,
 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Bureau of
Internal Revenue-Reorganization Appeals Board (BIR-RAB) rendered its decision
against <span class="SpellE">Ocera</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
54; Comment, p. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="5"><span style="">May 26,
 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Ocera</span> appealed to the Civil Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> was never
notified by the former of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither did the respondent Commission give any notice thereof to <span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 6; Petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came to know of it only when the
questioned resolution of </span><st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="9"><span style="">September 27, 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> was promulgated, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“In view thereof, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Simpao’s</span>
appointment as Supervising Revenue Enforcement Officer is deemed revoked. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Appellant De <span class="SpellE">Ocera</span>
should be appointed thereto instead and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> be considered to the Sr. Revenue Enforcement Officer
position vacated by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The BIR
Commissioner is hereby directed to immediately issue to herein contestants
their respective appointments, in accordance with the new staffing pattern of
the Bureau.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 20; Petition; Annex “A”, p.
3).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="10"><span style="">October
 17, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> filed with the respondent Commission a Motion for
Reconsideration with Urgent Prayer to Stay Execution (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 26; Petition; Annex “D”).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its
resolution of </span><st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="11"><span style="">November 24, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, the CSC found no cogent reason to warrant
reversal and denied reconsideration (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 75).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> based on the <span style="">following grounds:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Having itself found that the petitioner is in possession of the
basic and minimum qualifications for the position (under the reorganization
plan) of Supervising Revenue Enforcement Officer, the respondent Commission
gravely abused its discretion when it nullified petitioner’s appointment
thereto in palpable disregard of long established jurisprudence that in such
cases the discretionary choice of the appointing power cannot be supplanted by
that of the Civil Service Commission.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The grave abuse of discretion of the respondent Commission is
underscored by the fact that the petitioner, more than having the minimum
qualifications for the position, has been found by the BIR Personnel Evaluator
to be more competent, more qualified and more deserving than private respondent
De <span class="SpellE">Ocera</span>, and yet the Commission without any
justifiable reason disregarded this finding and, instead, resorted to a
distorted application of the Rules on Government Reorganization to come out
with the baseless conclusion that respondent De <span class="SpellE">Ocera</span>
has a ‘preferential right of appointment.’</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The respondent Commission denied petitioner’s right to due process
and compounding the violation of constitutional rights, brushed aside without
discussion the petitioner’s motion for reconsideration wherein it precisely raised
the issue of violation of the due process clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 7;
Petition, p. 6).</blockquote>

v. Court of Appeals, January 30, 1982, 111 SCRA 501; this Court held that “in

denial of opportunity to be heard x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.” (<span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> v. Barrios, L-23614;

Justice, June 28, 1974, 57 SCRA 663).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>“Absence of previous notice is not itself a substantial defect; what the

et al., L-<span style="">28218, February 27, 1970, 37
SCRA 745, 751).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The records disclose that
petitioner moved for reconsideration of the CSC decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
L. <span class="SpellE">Galura</span> v. Civil Service Commission, et al., G.R.
No. 85812, June 1, 1989, En Banc, Minute </span>Resolution, this Court held
that “a Motion for Reconsideration constitutes sufficient opportunity for the
party who feels aggrieved to inform the tribunal concerned of his side in the
controversy (<span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>,
63 SCRA 508 [1975]; <span class="SpellE">Dormitorio</span> v. Fernandez, 72 SCRA

488 [1982]).”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, there is merit
in <span class="SpellE">Simpao’s</span> contention that the Civil Service
Commission had committed grave </span>abuse of discretion in nullifying his
appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On all fours with the case
at bar, is the ruling of this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Pintor</span>
v. Tan, G.R. No. 84022, <span style="">March 9, 1989,
which is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Appointment is an essentially discretionary power and must be
exercised by the officer in which it is vested according to his best lights,
the fundamental requisite being that the appointee must possess the qualifications
required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If</u> <u>he</u> <u>does,</u>
<u>then</u> <u>the</u> <u>appointment</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>faulted</u>

qualifications is a ‘political’ or administrative question involving
considerations of wisdom and the interests <span style="">of </span>the service which only the appointing authority can decide (<span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Mamangun</span>, et al.,
G.R. No. 85941, June 15, 1989; <span class="SpellE">Luego</span> v. CSC, 143 SCRA

specified for the position involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That being so, the head of the office, <u>the</u> <u>Commissioner</u> <u>of</u>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is
well-settled that when the appointee is qualified, as in this case, and all the
other legal requirements are satisfied, the Commission has no alternative but
to attest to the appointment in accordance with the Civil Service Laws (<span class="SpellE">Luego</span> vs. CSC, 143 SCRA 327, 331 [1986]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission has no authority to revoke an
appointment on the ground that another person is more qualified for a
particular position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also has no
authority to direct the appointment of a substitute of its choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so would be an encroachment on the
discretion vested upon the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appointment is essentially within the
discretionary power of whomsoever it is vested, subject to the only condition
that the appointee should possess the qualifications required by law.” (Cited
in Lourdes R. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span> vs. Marina O. <span class="SpellE">Mamangun</span>, et al., G.R. No. 85941, June 15, 1989 and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Galura</span> vs. CSC, et
al., G.R. No. 85812, June 1, 1989, En Banc, Minute Resolution).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the <span style="">case </span>at bar, there is no question that
<span class="SpellE">Simpao</span> possesses the qualifications required for the
contested position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointing
authority had exercised its discretion and had chosen its appointee fully
cognizant of the respective positions previously held by the rival
candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The comment of the Assistant
Commissioner, Section Operations Officer is strongly indicative of the
determination made by the appointing officer of the one most suited for the
position from among the competing candidates, based on standards of competence
and integrity </span>and <span style="">as required by
the interest of the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right
of choice having been exercised, it cannot now be faulted on the ground that
there is another better qualified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Commission cannot substitute its will for that of the
appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In revoking the
appointment thus made, it had encroached on the discretion vested in the latter
(Central Bank, et al. v. CSC, </span>et <span style="">al.,
