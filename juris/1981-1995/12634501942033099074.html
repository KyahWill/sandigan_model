<p class="BODY">As recited in the People's brief, the facts as established by the
prosecution's evidence, upon which the judgment of conviction was based, are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="9">September 17,
 1972</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>, a 19 year old farmer,
was in the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span style="">James, </span>alias <span class="SpellE">Tivo</span>,
in <span class="SpellE">Sinaman</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
driving <span class="SpellE">maya</span> birds <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James arrived and joined <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> in driving the <span class="SpellE">maya</span> birds from the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> (p.
9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, January 17, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James
stayed in the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> the whole day, and at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, he left for
home, telling <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> that he would go ahead as <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> was quite far.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> saw him leaving the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>,
taking the upward trail toward the national road (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Suddenly thereafter, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>
heard three gun reports coming from the direction of the hillside trail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he turned his face and looked towards
the upper portion of the trail where <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James
already was, <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Cristituto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span>, alias "<span class="SpellE">Totot</span>",
standing about two fathoms away from <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant was holding a long-<span class="SpellE">barrelled</span> gun pointed at <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James, and he saw him shoot the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James retaliated and <span style="">fired back, but the appellant took to his heels and remained unscathed
(pp. 11-12, and p. 20, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The wounded victim retraced his steps to the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid), and
forthwith, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> went to meet him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James
told <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> that he was shot by <span class="SpellE">Totot</span>,
and in addition, he said "Bay, maybe I will be dying of these
wounds".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>
saw at once that <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James susÂ­tained wounds on
his arms and on his abdomen (p. 13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> has known <span class="SpellE">Totot</span>
for a long time, because he is the common-law husband of one of the daughters
of the victim (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Immediately, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> helped <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James go to the national road, and on their way,
they met <span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> <span class="SpellE">Solarte</span>, the
barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Sinaman</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> and the barrio captain then loaded the victim
on a <span class="SpellE">motorcab</span> and brought him to the clinic of Dr.
Ames (Ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim also told <span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> <span class="SpellE">Solarte</span> that probably he
would die of his wounds, and that he was shot by <span class="SpellE">Cristituto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
response, the barrio captain told the victim to hold his breath as much <span style="">as </span>possible until they reach the
doctor's clinic <span style="">(p. </span>15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon arrival at the doctor's clinic, Dr. Ames asked <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James who shot him, and the latter, who could
still talk but already in a low voice, answered, "I was shot by <span class="SpellE">Totot</span> in barrio <span class="SpellE">Sinaman</span>."
(Ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 o'clock</st1:time> that same evening, the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
City received a report that <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James was
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In immediate response, he summoned
Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Gonzales, the Deputy Chief of Police of
the <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City Police Force, and instructed him to
proceed to the clinic of Dr. Ames to investigate (pp. 41-42, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took
the ante-mortem statement of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James wherein
the following questions and answers were included:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Question No. 2 "Why are you in this
hospital?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"I was shot in <span class="SpellE">Sinaman</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Question No. 3 "Who shot you?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Cristituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Question No. 7 "Do you know why he
shot you?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Because he has an axe to grind against me."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Question No. 8 "Do you think you
will die as a result of your injuries?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"I think I will die." (Exhibits D, D-1, D-3, D-5, &amp; D-6;
pp. 43-44, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The ante-mortem statement which was
identified on the witness stand by Lt. Gonzales was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. Miranda (Exhibit D-9; p. 45, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid and pp. 4-6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, March 12, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears the bloodstains of the victim on the
right hand corner thereof (Exhibits D-10 and D-11), as testified to by Lt.
Gonzales (p. 46, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James was transferred to

Rec.) where he expired on <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1972</st1:date>, due to "general <span class="SpellE">peretonitis</span>
secondary to gunshot wounds", as evidenced by his death certificate
attached to the records as Exhibit F.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was bur<span style="">ied in <span class="SpellE">Sangkol</span>,
and his burial was attended by witness Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>
(p. 16, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, January 17, 1972).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the time of his death, the victim was a barrio captain of
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sangkol</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
and he was the lone support of 12 children (pp. 12-17, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Heronica</span> James, testified that at the <span style="">Ames </span>Clinic,
she spend P550.00; at the Chung <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> Hospital,
P2,845.00; for embalming the body of the victim, P750.00; for subsistence <span style="">when </span>taking care of the victim,
P300.00; boat fare for her and the body of the victim, P30.00; for funeral expenses,
P800.00 and incidental expenses, P172.00, so that she is asking the court to
sentence the appellant to pay P20,000.00 as actual and compensatory damages,
and P40,000.00 as moral damages (pp. 17-18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The post-mortem examination (Exhibit A) conÂ­ducted by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Leorosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Orendain</span>,
Rural Health Physician of <span class="SpellE">Katipunan</span>, and the PHO Form
No. 2, or the diagram of the body of the victim (Exhibit B), show that <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James sustained a bullet wound on the abdomen
which was fatal, as it perforated the intestines (pp. 37-38, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February 22, 1973), and three other bullet wounds on
the left wrist, on the left forearm, and on the left arm (Exhibits B-3, B-5,
&amp; B-7; pp. 38-39, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid). <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Orendain</span> was able to extract a slug from the body of
the victim (Exhibit C-1; p. 37, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).</blockquote>

a provincial guard of <span class="SpellE">Olingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
City, testified that they saw <span class="SpellE">Cristituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span> board a logging truck of the <span class="SpellE">Dumingag</span>
Timber Corporation, first at <span class="SpellE">Malala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Polangco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte,

away from <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City, in the early morning of Sept.

used to see him (<span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span>) hunting or inspecting with
the Governor (p. 4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid). <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacaya</span>, on the other hand, testified that he came to
know <span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span> when the latter was accused of the crime
of robbery and was committed at the provincial jail in <span class="SpellE">Katipunan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte (p. 25, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Prosecution evidence likewise show that <span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span>
was also detained once at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> jail for Frustrated Murder,
the complainant of which was <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James, the
same victim of murder in this case (p. 47, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February
22, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the investigation
conducted in connection with said Frustrated Murder case, <span class="SpellE">Cristituto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span> admitted that he was not in good terms with <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James, because the latter was objecting to his
marrying <span class="SpellE">Primitivo's</span> daughter Helen James (p. 51, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span> also executed an extra-judicial confession, Exhibit
E, wherein he admitted <span style="">the </span>attempt
he made on the life of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James sometime in
April 1972, or only five months previous to the killing of the same vicÂ­tim
(pp. 47-51, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his three assignments of errors, appellant assails the trial
court's assessment of the evidence particularly the ante-mortem declaration
(Exhibit D)<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of the deceased and the testimony of Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>,
the eye-witness to the shooting, who saw appellant fire at the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In impugning the credibility of the ante-mortem declaration
(Exhibit D), appellant contends that the deceased could not have seen his
assailant to be able to name him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant would back up this assertion with the relative positions of
the entrance and exit of the wounds sustained by the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James, to show that his assailant was at his
back, not in front of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailant
then ran away so fast that the victim was not able to recognize him even as the
deceased tried to turn around to see who fired at him from behind in quick
succession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attempt of appellant to show that the assailant was at the
back of the deceased, unseen by the latter when he first fired, and
unrecognized when he turned around to run away from sight, is effectively
foiled or frustrated with how the Solicitor General very persuasively demonstrates,
with the same means as those resorted to by appellant, that the assailant was
not at the back of the victim, but in front of him, as the eye-witness,
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>, so testified when, he pointed to
appellant as the gunman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, to quote
from the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
will be clearly seen from the position of the injuries sustained by the victim,
as enumerated and reproduced by the appellant in his brief (pp. 6-8, ibid) ,
that the gunshot wounds inflicted on <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James
were frontal in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wound No. 1 in
the post mortem findings is on the abdomen of the deceased, at 45 degrees angle
from the umbilicus (p. 6, ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
wounds on the left wrist and left forearm were from the dorsal to the ventral sides,
while the wound on the upper left arm is from the ventral to the dorsal
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Analyzing the relative positions
of the entrance and exit of the wounds, and the trajectory of the bullets which
admittedly indicates that they were fired from a higher elevation than the
place where the victim was at the time (p. 9, Appellant's brief), we are of the
opinion that the victim was fired upon as he was negotiating the upward trail,
and that his assailant was in the upper portion of the trail, a little to the
right side of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is borne
out by the wound on the upper left arm of the victim, the entrance of which is
on the ventral side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We contend that
this was the first wound inflicted, and by reflex action, out of pain, the
victim who was then in a walking position, bent his arm and rested his left
forearm on his abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explains
the entrance wounds on the dorsal side of the mid-forearm and on the left wrist
of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A careful analysis of the
foregoing exposition by the Solicitor General on how the shooting took place,
particularly the relative positions of the gunman and the deceased, as </span><span style="">well </span><span style="">as the comparative elevation of their respective positions at the time
of the firing, would show a greater degree of plausibility of the theory of the
prosecution than that of the defense which is explained in appellant's brief as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Now, from the relative positions of the entrances and exits
of the four bullet-wounds on <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James, let us
now reconstruct how James moved and reacted upon having been shot by his
assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James, upon having been hit and wounded on his left arm by <u>the</u> <u><span style="">first</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>three</u> <u><span style="">bullets</span></u><span style="">, </span>he may have made a swift clock-wise
turn or from left to right movement to face his assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James was a bit more than one-half (1/2) of his pivoted turn, he was hit by the
last and fourth bullet by his assailant on the right hypochondriac, (Exhibit
'B-1'), penetrating through the small intestines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious, that the assailant of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James fired his gun in rapid succession, (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 19, <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">Jan.
 17, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, the
incident was too fast and momentary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, we respectfully submit, that under the above momentary movements
of the assailant and the assaulted, <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James <u>could</u>
<u>not</u> <u>have</u> <u><span style="">recognized</span></u><span style=""> </span>his assailant, who turned his back
and ran away as soon as James was in a turning position to face his supposed
assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that is the reason when <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James retaliated and fired his magnum revolver at
his assailant for four (4) times, (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 19,
Jan. 17, 1973), yet he was not able to hit his assailant; and his assailant
must have been at a longer distance from James.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We respectfully submit, therefore, that neither Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> nor <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James could
have recognized the real assailant of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the simple reason that the incident of
shooting took placed not on the upward trail on the hill, but on the downward
trail of the same (see Finding No. 3 or Exhibit 'B-3', the trajectory of bullet
was downward), Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> who was on the side of
the upward trail of the hill could not see the other side of the hill nor the
people thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, his testimony that
he saw the accused, <span class="SpellE">Cristituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lariosa</span>
<span style="">s</span>hoot <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James could not have any factual truth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, we respectfully submit that <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James would not likewise be able to <span style="">identify
his </span>assailant, due to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James was shot in four rapid successions while his back was turned toward his
assailÂ­ant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shooting was <span style="">so </span>fast and monetary, that when he was
about to <span style="">come </span>face to face with
his assailant, the latter turned and ran away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As may be seen, appellant's theory is pure speculation, wanting
in any corroboration which the prosecution's theory counts with, from the
testimony of Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> that he heard only three
shots before the victim fired back, although four wounds were sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One shot could have caused two wounds, the
wound on the left wrist and that on the abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking a downward trajectory from the higher
elevation it was fired, the bullet hit the left wrist of the victim resting on
his abdomen as a reflex action after the first wound on the upper left arm was
inflicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A direct corroboration is, of
course, <span class="SpellE">Adaro's</span> eye-witness testimony pointing to the
appellant as the gunman, having seen him holding a long-<span class="SpellE">barrelled</span>
gun, pointing it and shooting at the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(pp. 11-12; 20, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally strong evidence against the appellant, if not even
stronger, is the ante-mortem declaration of the deceased, in which he named
appellant as his assailant (Exhibit D),<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which is the document to which was reduced his statement first, to <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>, to whom he said with his wounds, he was going to
die, next to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Solarte</span>,
then to Dr. Ames, and finally, to the Deputy Chief of Police, as he
progressively neared death, that appellant was the person who shot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even as mere <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">gestae</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>the declaration would be of similar
probative value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is evidently
futile for appellant to assail the dying declaration of the deceased with his
assertion that it was motivated by the victim's hatred against him for having
taken his daughter as a common-law wife and his desire to put an end to the
disgraceful relationship.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the deceased was not shown to have done
anything before the fatal shooting incident against appellant indicative of the
existence of the alleged, motive against him by the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the relationship came into being at all
would rather show that the victim's attitude towards said relationship was one
of passive indifference, not of active disapproval or determined opposition
that could nurse a motive as that appellant would attribute to the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, having made the declaration at the point of
death, the truth thereof can hardly be disputed with the well-known verity that
truth lies in the lips of a dying man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And even if <span style="">a </span>grudge dwelt in his heart against appellant, forgiveness would
instantly replace it to generate the sentiment and wish to speak nothing but
the truth as one closes his eyes in death.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is apparent from the evidence is the existence of a motive
on the part of appellant to do away with <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James, the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that he
had made an earlier attempt against the life of the deceased, committed on
April 3, 1972, because of the latter's objection to appellant's marriage to <span class="SpellE">Jame's</span> daughter, Helen James. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He made a confession of the criminal act, for
which he was charged with frustrated murder, although the case was dismissed
for lack of corroborative evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also tried to discredit the eye-witness testimony of <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> by asserting that the latter could not have seen the
incident <span style="">because </span>it took place
at the side <span style="">of </span>the hill opposite
that where <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> stated he was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From what has been said earlier that
appellant frontally inflicted the wounds, not from behind as claimed by
appellant, this contention seeking to dispute the truth of <span class="SpellE">Adaro's</span>
testimony finds no factual basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, on ocular inspection as requested by the defense itself, the trial court
found against the claim of appellant that <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> could
not have seen who the assailant of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> James
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trial court said in its
decision:</p>

<blockquote>"After the trial was terminated, the defense asked for an
ocular inspection claiming that witness <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> could
not have seen the incident because it happened more than two kilometers away
from the <span class="SpellE">camarin</span> where witness <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>
claimed he was at the time of the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the inspection which was conducted by the Court, neither counsel for
the accused nor any representative of the accused appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution was represented by the
prosecuting fiscal, <span class="SpellE">Arquipo</span> La <span class="SpellE">Adriatico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From actual ocular inspection, the place
where the shooting took place, according to this witness <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>,
was about 50 to 60 meters away from the <span class="SpellE">camarin</span> and
even at the time when the inspection was conducted when the hillside was quite
grassy, it is possible that the assailant in that incident could have been seen
by witness <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> because from the place where the
assailant allegedly stood, the <span class="SpellE">camarin</span> and the spot
under the <span class="SpellE">camarin</span> where the witness was allegedly at,
at the time, was visible to the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Adaro</span> on his testimony on the ocular inspection declared
that the hill-side was then cleared because it was newly planted to
cassava."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With all the <span class="SpellE">positiveness</span> with which
appellant was identified as the killer of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
James, consisting of the testimony of eye-witness Fernando <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>,
and the ante-mortem declaration of the deceased, appellant's defense of alibi
is unavailing.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
His pretension of having been in <span class="SpellE">Titay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, working in the
Marcelo Rubber Plantation using the name of <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Cesante</span>, with David <span class="SpellE">Gumaba</span> as his
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">capataz</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>from <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="9">September 17 to 22, 1972</st1:date> had not a bit of
corroboration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Helen James' testimony as
a defense witness is only to the effect that appellant told her that he was
going to <span class="SpellE">Titay</span>, but did not go with him to <span class="SpellE">Titay</span>, and so was never with him there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His other witness, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
James, involved himself in a mesh of contradictions, and even admitted having doubts
as to the wisdom of testifying for appellant, because the victim was his
grandfather who was shot on September 17, 1972.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
His alleged <span class="SpellE"><u>capataz</u></span>, David <span class="SpellE">Gumaba</span>,
refused to appear in court to corroborate appellant's alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have not chosen to do otherwise in
the face of the testimony of two very reliable witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumactod</span> and <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacaya</span>, security and provincial guards, respectively, that
in the early evening of September 18, 1972, the day following the shooting,
they saw appellant going away from the direction of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
City where the shooting incident took place, riding on a logging truck headed
for the cutting area of the <span class="SpellE">Dumingag</span> Timber
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With no interest or bias
against appellant, they testified only out of a civic duty to help in the
prosecution of criminal offenders and their punishment if convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever inconsistencies may have been
committed by them with which their testimony is assailed by appellant, is no
ground to deny them the credibility they deserve which is not affected by
inconsistencies on minor and inconsequential matters, which is what the alleged
inconsistencies actually are.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment appealed from found no modifying circumstance, not
even that of evident premeditation as alleged in the information to have
attended the commission of the crime, which the court found to be that of
murder, with treachery as the qualifying circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>find
the evidence <span style="">fully </span>supporting
these findings of the trial court.</p>
