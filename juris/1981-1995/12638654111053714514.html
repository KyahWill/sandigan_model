<p class="BODY">Respondent court found that the evidence established the
following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> <span style="">is </span>a
businessman and deals in real estate transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has known appellant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span> for some time and prior to <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1967</st1:date>, on two occasions, he had extended
small loans to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1967</st1:date>, appellant went to the

appellant offered to the complainant his <span class="SpellE">Opel</span> car,
and it was agreed that the loan would be given on condition that it would be
secured by a proper chattel mortgage on the said motor vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the assurance from appellant that the
car was fully paid and free from any encumbrance, the complainant gave appellant
a note addressed to one Atty. <span class="SpellE">Azaña</span> requesting the
latter to prepare the document.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the chattel mortgage contract over the <span class="SpellE">Opel</span>
car which was in the possession of appellant was prepared by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Azaña</span>, and after the complainant and appellant ha<span style="">d </span>signed the same, the loan of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was <span style="">named to </span>appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loan was also evidenced by a promissory

complainant the sum of P1,000.00 eight (8) days <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When appellant failed to pay the loan on time, the complainant
thought of taking physical possession of the car but when he went to the office
of the Northern Motors, Inc., he found, to his surprise, that the <span class="SpellE">Opel</span> car of <span class="SpellE">apellant</span> had been
repossessed by said firm for failure of appellant to pay the installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant thereafter, made demands on
appellant to pay, but to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1967</st1:date>, the complainant
wrote appellant a formal letter of demand giving him ten (10) days within which
to settle his obligation, otherwise "you would place me under extreme
necessity to make the legal steps in cases of this nature." (Exhibit
"C")</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1967</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">an information</span> for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
was filed against appellant in court, docketed as Criminal Case No. 5417.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime after the case had been filed,
appellant offered to settle his obligation by giving to the complainant two (2)
Singer sewing machines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
suggestion of Presiding Judge <span style="">Jose </span><span class="SpellE">Razo</span>, the complainant agreed to accept the said security
from appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the
receipt<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit "E"), the
complainant bound himself to return the two sewing machines as soon as the sum
of P1,000.00 plus interest is paid on or before July 30, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the accused failed to pay the obligation
on the due date, the trial proceeded.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the appellant
presented his own version of the facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defense evidence is accurately summarized by the trial court as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="6"><span style="">June 7, </span>1967</st1:date>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, accused in the above entitled case, went to the
complainant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, to borrow money in the
amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">complainant gave the accused
a </span>loan <span style="">of P900.00, but the
latter was made to sign a promissory note (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘A’)
in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,050.00</span>, the difference of P150.00 being
the interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said amount in the
promissory note was made payable within eight (8) days from receipt of the
amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was also made to
sign a chattel mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'B')
of his ‘OPEL’ car.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused,
however, before he signed the chattel mortgage, made </span>known to the
complainant that the car which was being made the subject of the chattel
mortgage has not yet been fully paid to the Northern Motors Corporation, but
the complainant still insisted of (sic) having it made <span style="">as (a) </span>security.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the expiration of the 8 days period within which to pay
the loan, accused was in tight financial condition, so he went to see the
complainant and asked for a grace period which was granted by the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, the accused failed to pay the installment payment
on the car which was constituted <span style="">as </span>security, so the same was repossessed by
the Northern Motors Corporation, thru its local representative, Mr. Joaquin Los
<span class="SpellE">Baños</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, when the accused still failed to pay the
amount of P1<span class="GramE">,050.00</span> to the complainant, the latter
went to see Mr. Joaquin Los <span class="SpellE">Baños</span>, the local
representative of the Northern Motors Corporation in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
to negotiate about the <span class="SpellE">Opel</span> car of the accused which
was mortgaged to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant,
however, was told chat the car was already repossessed by the company for
failure of the accused to pay the installment payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the car was no longer available and
the accused still failed to pay <span style="">the
loan after the lapse of several months, the complainant asked the accused to
put up another security.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On April 29, 1968, complainant took two (2) sewing machine
from the shop of the accused on the condition that if accused pays the P1<span class="GramE">,050.00</span> on or before July 30, 1968, the machines will be
returned; but if the accused still fails to pay the amount within the said
period, then the machines will be retained by the complainant as payment of the
loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 'E').<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused failed to pay the amount of the loan within the stipulated
period, so the two sewing machines were retained by the complainant and up to
this time, the same are still in the complainant's possession.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, upon failure of the accused to pay the loan,
complainant filed a complaint with the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office and the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office of <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span> City filed <span class="GramE">an information</span>
against the accused charging him (with) the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial in the City Court the theory of the accused was
rejected by said court on the following well analyzed considerations which
merit extended reproduction:</p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> version of the accused, regarding the execution of the
mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B'), the giving of the P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>-loan, and the issuance of the receipt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘I’), is inherently improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, the Court observed that the
accused is an <span style="">intelligent and intrepid
businessman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His demeanor indicates that
he knew when and how to play dump (sic).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He knew how to keep cool and manage in the midst of financial trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His deportment on the witness stand suggests
that he is alert and cannot easily be deceived.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"To lure the complainant into giving him the bigger loan of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the accused first borrowed smaller loans from
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To gain the complainant's
confidence, he paid him such smaller loans on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this, the accused availed of his
possession of the <span class="SpellE">Opel</span> car and pleaded for
complainant to lend him P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> payable after eight
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Intelligent and intrepid, as the
accused has shown himself, he agree to the P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>-loan
with the car as security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
knew then, or must have naturally known, that he could not possibly meet the
deadline for the payment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> (57).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, he agreed to the execution of the
mortgage over the car that he did not own, and which was then due for
seizure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon this circumstance, the
unsuspecting complainant parted with his money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is obvious, therefore, that the accused took complainant's money in
bad faith and with fraudulent intent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, on this score, considering that the complainant appears to (be) a
proprietor and an upright businessman, his testimony is entitled to more
credence than that of the accused <span class="GramE">who</span>, in the ordinary
course of human conduct, is expected to testify favorably for himself (58).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
testimony of the accused on the same note (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>A'), mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>, ’B'), and
receipt (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. ‘I’; 'E'), is riddled with
irreconcilable inconsistencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
instance, the accused initially declared that he signed the mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B') because the complainant told him to do so (59),
giving the impression that he was forced into executing the mortgage against
his will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <span style="">cross-examination, however, the accused confessed that the complainant
did not force him to sign said note and mortgage and that he signed the same
only because he was ashamed to refuse the complainant (60).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contradictory aspect in the testimony
(of) the accused worsened in the face of his other </span>declaration <span style="">that he came to know about the mortgage when
he was already arrested (61).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, the accused also testified that before signing the same note and
mortgage, he read their contents and sensed the thought of the contract (62).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In another instance, the accused declared on direct
examination that he received from the complainant only the amount of P900.00,
not P1,000.00 (63).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on
cross-examination, the accused reversed his earlier testimony by declaring
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The one thousand pesos (1,000.00)
was first given to me, thereafter I signed the mortgage' (64).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Similarly, the accused testified that, upon his default in
the payment of the P1000-loan he went to the complainant and explained that the
non-payment was due to his (the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>) failure to
collect certain investments (65).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, however, the accused declared that, upon default in his
obligation to pay after the lapse of the 6-day period:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Mr. Mariano <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>
went to my house and got my two (2) sewing machines...' (66).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The preceding material inconsistencies within the defense'
testimony cannot but create serious doubt as to their veracity and sincerity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other
portions of the declaration of the accused are characterized by
evasiveness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused cannot recall
certain facts which would naturally have left deep impressions on his mind in
consequence of <span style="">his mercantile dealings
with the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To exemplify, the
accused declared that he cannot remember whether the loans extended to him by
the complainant, prior to </span><st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="6"><span style="">June 7, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> were secured or not by a mortgage (67).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that he cannot recall when
he signed the chattel mortgage (68).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
likewise declared that he cannot remember whether he received a demand-letter
from the complainant after the lapse of the period for the payment of the loan
(69).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that he cannot
remember </span>whether he <span style="">presented as
evidence the receipt (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">‘I' and
'E') during the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> investigation of this case
(70).</span></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“The other evasive phase in his testimony <span style="">is </span>noticeable in the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To demonstrate <span style="">one </span><span style="">more instance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was asked whether, after </span><st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30,
 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, he tried to
recover the sewing machines from the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply, the accused evaded the question by
answering that he went to the complainant to tell him that he could not pay the
P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>-loan (72).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In all these instances, it is patent that the accused could
have easily answered the questions categorically instead of being evasive about
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an attitude, as <span style="">displayed here by the accused, naturally
weakens the worth of his narrative."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> then rendered a decision holding appellant
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
by means of deceit as defined and penalized under Article 318 of the Revised
Penal Code, and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment of 3 months of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, to pay a fine of P1,000.00 and
to indemnify the offended party, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, in
the sum of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00), plus 12% interest thereon per annum
from June 7, 1967 until <span style="">said </span>amount

<p class="BODY">We agree with the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> findings
and conclusions of the lower court which were affirmed by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusions and findings of
fact by the trial court are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed
on appeal, unless for strong and cogent reasons, because the trial court is in
a better position to examine as well as to observe the demeanor of the
witnesses while testifying on the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive points raised in this petition require the
resolution of the following issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
Whether or not appellant employed false representations and false pretenses in
obtaining the loan from the complainant, thus making him guilty of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> by means of deceit under Article 318, paragraph 1,
of the Revised Penal Code; and (2) Whether or not the receipt of the two (2)
sewing machines by the private respondent amounts to the payment of the loan,
thus extinguishing the obligation in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, appellant advances several arguments to
support his claim that no deceit was employed, ergo no felony was ever
committed, which submissions we shall now discuss.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court,
says appellant, was in error in holding that he employed deceit because the
chattel mortgage was executed at the instance of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is untenable because even if the chattel
mortgage was so executed, the fact that deceit was employed by appellant cannot
be gainsaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties are engaged in
business and it is normal for them to require some form of security to protect
their interests in lending money to other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Article 2140 of the Civil Code
provides that “(b<span class="GramE">)y</span> a chattel mortgage, personal
property is recorded in the Chattel Mortgage Register as a security for the
performance of an obligation."</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly commented by the Solicitor General, "appellant's
denial that he had not employed deceit in obtaining the loan from Mariano <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Locsin</span></span><span style=""> </span>because it is the latter who
suggested that he would be able to borrow P1,000.00 if he (appellant) executes
a chattel mortgage on his sedan car x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> although Mario <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> suggested
that he would be able to lend him the amount asked for by appellant only <span style="">on </span>the condition that a security be
given thereto (sic), the assurance made by appellant that the car offered as <span style="">a </span>security
had never been encumbered and his failure to disclose to Mario <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> that said car was previously mortgaged to the
Northern Motors, Co., constitute deception."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also argues
that the presentation of his testimony that the car subject of the chattel
mortgage was already paid, when complainant was already testifying on rebuttal,
was merely an effort to remedy an omission of a fact which should have been
proven in the presentation of the evidence in chief of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact, however, that this was presented in
rebuttal does not make said evidence of the prosecution wanting in veracity
because the admission of rebuttal evidence is addressed to the sound discretion
of the trial court with considerable latitude being allowed, and such
discretion will not be disturbed absent a finding that the accused was taken by
surprise or was prevented from introducing <span class="SpellE">sur</span>-rebuttal
evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Also, it is competent for a court to allow a party who has closed his case to
introduce additional evidence as late as the rebuttal stage.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, appellant
contends that the court below was in error when it declared that the accused
had no title to the car, and seeks to buttress his theory by quoting the
following legal provisions:</p>

<blockquote>"The ownership of the thing sold is acquired by the vendee
from the moment it is delivered to him in any of the ways specified in Article
1497 to 1501, or in any other manner signifying an agreement that the
possession is transferred from the vendor to the vendee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1496, New Civil <span class="GramE">Code).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The thing sold shall be understood <span style="">as </span>delivered when it is placed in the control and possession of
the vendee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1497, New Civil
Code)."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The provisions cited by appellant are grossly irrelevant to the
issue on deceit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is material here
is the fact that appellant was guilty of fraudulent <span style="">misrepresentation when, knowing that the car was then owned by the
Northern Motors, Inc., still he told the complainant that the car was actually
owned by him for purposes of and at the time he obtained the loan from the
latter. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Indubitably, the accused was in
bad faith in the <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> of said loan under such
