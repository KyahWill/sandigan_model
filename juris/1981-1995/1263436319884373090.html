Estillana, FELIPE SEGUNDO was sentenced to <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.  Now </span>before us, he repeats that his <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">comadre</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>is an old flame and that their sexual congress was between two
consenting adults.  Erlinda however
fervidly denies this.  We believe her,
as did the court <i>a </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">quo</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Erlinda narrated her ordeal in open court thus:   On 4 October 1986, together with her two
children, she decided to pass the night in the house of the spouses Romeo and
Merlen Castillo, their family friends, in Sitio Danapa since her husband Primo
Estillana failed to return that evening from Barangay Kinaguitman, Northern Samar,
where Primo, Romeo and accused-appellant Felipe Segundo went to sell their
copra.  The three had drunk heavily
before heading for home.  Primo passed
out and thus could not manage the 3-1/2 kilometer trek back to Sitio
Danapa.  Only Romeo and Felipe were able
to make it home.  At about ten o'clock
that evening, Erlinda laid the mat Romeo had given her and started to sleep
with her two children.  She was awakened
by accused-appellant Felipe Segundo who pulled her and started kissing
her.  She kicked and shouted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>help, but was instead threatened
with a <i>kinogon</i> (a local knife).  She continued struggling and kicking but became weak and numb after she
was hit in the thighs.  Then she was
ravaged.  He kissed and mashed her
breasts, inserted his fingers into her vagina and thereafter raped her.  During her ordeal, she heard Romeo from the
adjoining room ordering her to keep quiet.  The following morning, she was fetched by her husband Primo from the
Castillo household.  Upon reaching their
house, she recounted her fate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>Primo.  She subsequently submitted herself for a
medical examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Jesus M. Bacayo, Senior Resident Physician in the Allen
District Hospital, testified that when he examined Erlinda on 23 October 1986
she had an old hematoma on both thighs which could have been caused by fist
blows, and which could have immobilized her.  She also had lacerations in the labia majora and minora which could have
been caused by the forceful ramming of a blunt object against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of Erlinda’s complaint, the information for rape filed
against Felipe included the couple Romeo and Merlen Castillo who allegedly
conspired with the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felipe Segundo however has a different tale.  He claims that Erlinda is an old sweetheart,
their intimacies dating back to their high school days in 1979.  They both resided in Barangay Kinaguitman,
Allen, Northern Samar, and frequently walked together to the town to attend
school.  He was then in fourth year
while she was in third year.  Their
relationship was cut short in 1980 when Erlinda had to leave for Manila.  Thereafter, they led separate lives.  He married Susan and resided in Sitio
Danapa, while Erlinda lived-in with her common-law husband Primo in
Manila.  However, Primo and Erlinda
returned to reside in Sitio Danapa and became his neighbors together with the
Castillos.  The three couples became so
close that Primo and Felipe stood as sponsors in the baptism of a child of
Romeo and Merlen.  Primo also became the
godfather of Felipe's son Arvin.  He
denies having sexual intercourse with Erlinda on 4 October 1986.  He claims that after drinking with Primo and
Romeo that evening in the house of Mario Libete in Barangay Kinaguitman, he
spent the night with his mother who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fetched
him.  After that evening, nothing
unusual happened as he was even asked two days later to take care of Erlinda’s
sow with the agreement that its piglets would be shared equally.  He however alleges that on 13 October 1986,
at about ten o'clock in the morning, he chanced upon Erlinda washing clothes
beside a well near the house of Romeo and Merlen Castillo.  He approached her and reminded her of their
past.  Their conversation ended with an
agreement to satisfy their sexual urge that same afternoon.  Thus, after having their respective meals,
they again met beside the well and proceeded to the kitchen in the house of
Romeo and Merlen Castillo to relieve themselves.  There, Erlinda laid down on a bench while he unzipped his pants
and went on top of her.  However, as
they were just about to satisfy their lust, Susan, appellant's wife, barged
into the kitchen and caught them.  Meanwhile, Merlen who was awakened, went to the kitchen to see what the
commotion was all about.  Pale and
trembling, Erlinda could not speak.  Merlen was then told by Susan that she caught Erlinda and her (Susan's)
husband making love.  That same
afternoon, Merlen informed Primo, upon the latter's return from the ricefield,
of what transpired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the first error
assigned, appellant claims that </span>the testimony of Erlinda "does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not invite the slightest belief."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This is untenable.  We have ruled time and again that rape can
be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the

"tenacious resistance" was absent is unacceptable, for it has been
settled that the law does not impose a burden on the rape victim to prove
resistance.  What needs only to be
established is the use of force or intimidation by the accused in having sexual
intercourse with the victim.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> This, the prosecution was able to prove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

chance to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">see his face and

without merit.  It is not uncommon for
criminals to be careless about or to even intentionally reveal their identities
to their victims.  The failure by a
criminal to conceal his identity would not make the commission of the crime any
less credible.  Bragadoccio among
criminals is not unexpected.  Very often
too, they are secure in the thought that they have instilled sufficient fear in
their victims that the latter will not give them away to the authorities.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

ruled </span>that a four-month delay in reporting the rape incident may be

reporting the rape may be due to the malefactor's threat that he would harm her

shame that would result from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
disclosure of the </span>dishonor done to her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the complaining witness on 4 October 1986, it was with their mutual consent
must be rejected.  As found by the trial
court which had the opportunity and responsibility to observe the witnesses and
assess their credibility, the testimony of Erlinda deserves credence.  And absent any showing of arbitrariness, we
have to respect the findings of the trial court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
There being no traces of arbitrariness, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">we
cannot stray from the finding that Erlinda was indeed raped by
accused-appellant in the evening of 4 October 1986.  When </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">woman says
that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that
rape was committed and that if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the

business.  But when one mate fails to
charm the other and forces her into submission against her will, then the law

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution being more than sufficient to
prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant Felipe Segundo is
guilty of rape and should be sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> under Art.
