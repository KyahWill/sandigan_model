Trial Court's orders dated August 15, 1983 and May 24, 1984 and prohibiting it
from further proceeding in Civil Case No. 1028-P.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 30, 1982, the Philippine Blooming Mills, Inc. (PBM) and
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> jointly submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission a petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">for </span>suspension
of payments (SEC No. 2250) where Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> was
joined as co-petitioner because under the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">law,
he was allegedly entitled, as surety, to avail of the defenses of PBM and he
was expected to raise most of the stockholders’ equity of P100 million being
required under the plan for the rehabilitation of PBM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Traders Royal Bank was included </span>among <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">PBM's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> creditors named in Schedule <span class="GramE">A</span> accompanying <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> petition for
suspension of payments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">May </span>13, 1983,
the petitioner bank filed Civil Case No. 1028-P in the Regional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Trial Court, Branch
</span>CXIII in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, against PBM and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>, to collect P22,227,794.05 <span class="SpellE">excIusive</span>
of interests, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">penalties and other bank
charges representing <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> outstanding obligation to
the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>,
a stockholder of PBM, was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as co-defendant
for having signed as a surety for <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> obligations
to the extent of ten million pesos (P10<span class="GramE">,000,000</span>) under
a Deed of <span class="SpellE">Suretyship</span> dated </span><st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 21,

<p class="BODY">In its <u>en</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">banc</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>decision in SEC-EB No. 018 (Chung Ka
Bio, et al. vs. Hon. Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span>, et al.), the
SEC declared that it had assumed jurisdiction over<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> petitioner Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> pursuant </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section 6, Rule 3 of the new Rules of
Procedure of the SEC providing that "parties in interest without whom no
final determination can be had of an action shall be joined either as
complainant, petitioner or respondent" to prevent multiplicity of suits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 9, 1982, the SEC issued an Order placing <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> business, including its assets and liabilities, under
rehabilitation receiverships and ordered that "all actions for claims
listed in Schedule A of the petition pending <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">before </span>any court or tribunal are <span class="GramE">hereby</span>
suspended in whatever stage the same may be, until further orders from the
Commission" (p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As directed by the SEC, said order was
published once a week for three consecutive weeks in the Bulletin Today,
Philippine Daily Express and Times <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Journal
</span>at the expense of PBM and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">PBM and <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> jointly filed a motion to
dismiss Civil Case No. 1028-P in the RTC, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">invoking </span>the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
in the SEC of <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> application for suspension <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>payments (which <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>
co-signed) and over which the SEC had already assumed jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the motion to dismiss could be resolved, the court dropped
PBM from the complaint, on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motion </span>of
the plaintiff bank, for the reason that the SEC had already placed PBM under
rehabilitation receivership.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1983</st1:date>,
the trial court denied <span class="SpellE">Ching's</span> motion to dismiss the
complaint against <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court pointed out that "P.D. 1758 is
only concerned with the activities of corporations, partnerships and
associations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Never was it intended to
regulate and/or control activities of individuals" (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ching's</span> motion for reconsideration of that order was denied
on <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge argued that under P.D.
902-A, as amended, the SEC may not validly acquire jurisdiction over an
individual, like <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> (<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">p. </span>62, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ching</span> filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition in the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 03593) to annul the
orders of respondent Judge and to prohibit him from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">further </span>proceeding <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the
civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">raised in </span>the
petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the court <u>a</u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>quo</u> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">could </span>acquire jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in his personal and individual capacity as a
surety of </span>PBM in the collection suit filed by the bank, despite the fact
that <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> obligation to the bank had been placed
under receivership by the SEC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1987</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals granted the writs prayed for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">It </span>nullified
the questioned orders of respondent Judge and prohibited him from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">further </span>proceeding in Civil Case No.

reads:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"In sum, since the SEC had assumed jurisdiction over petitioner

taking cognizance of the civil case in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> brought by
respondent bank to enforce the surety agreement against petitioner for the
purpose of collecting payment of <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> outstanding
obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent bank should have
questioned the SEC's assumption of jurisdiction over petitioner in an appellate
forum and not in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, a tribunal with which the SEC
enjoys a co-equal and coordinate rank." <span class="GramE">(p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Bank assails that decision in this petition for review
alleging that the appellate court <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. in holding that jurisdiction over respondent Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> was assumed by the SEC because he was a co-signer or
surety of PBM and that the lower court may not assume jurisdiction over him so
as to avoid multiplicity of suits; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2. <span class="GramE">in</span> holding that the jurisdiction
assumed by the SEC over <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> was to the exclusion of
courts or tribunals of coordinate rank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for review is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">

<p class="BODY">Although <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
in SEC Case No. 2250, as a co-petitioner of PBM, the SEC could not assume
jurisdiction over his person and properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Securities and Exchange Commission was empowered, as rehabilitation
receiver, to take custody and control of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">assets </span>and properties of PBM only, for the SEC has jurisdiction
over corporations only not over <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">private
individuals, except stockholders in an intra-corporate dispute (Sec. 5, P.D.
902-A and Sec. 2 of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P.D. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1758).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Being a nominal party in SEC Case No. 2250, <span class="SpellE">Ching's</span>
properties were not included in the rehabilitation receivership that the SEC
constituted to take custody of <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> assets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the petitioner bank was not barred
from filing a suit against <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
