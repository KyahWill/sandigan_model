Proceeding No. 70878, Testate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decree of probate was affirmed by the

 30, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the testate proceeding, Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
Gonzalez, a daughter of the testatrix, filed on May 20, 1968 a motion to
exclude from the inventory of her mother's estate the pro­perties which she
inherited from her deceased daughter, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>, on
the ground that said properties are <span class="SpellE"><u>reservable</u></span><u>
</u>properties which should be inherited by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Legarda's</span> three sisters and three brothers and not by the
children of Benito, Alejandro and Jose, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion was opposed by the administrator,
Benito F. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without awaiting the resolution on that motion, Mrs. Gonzalez
filed on June 20, 1968 an ordinary civil action against <span style="">her brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces and her mother's estate for
the purpose of securing a declaration that the said properties are <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> properties which Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
could not bequeath in her holographic will to her grandchildren to the
exclusion of her three daughters and her three sons (See Paz vs. Madrigal, 100
Phil. 1085).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the lower court dismissed the action of Mrs.
Gonzalez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this appeal under Republic
Act No. 5440 she contends in her six assignments of error that the lower court
erred in not regarding the properties in question as <span class="SpellE">reservable</span>
properties under article 891 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
in their six counter-assignments of error contend that the lower court erred in
not holding that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> acquired the estate of
her daughter <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
in exchange for her con­jugal and hereditary shares in the estate of her husband
Benito <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> <span style="">y
</span>De la Paz and in not holding that Mrs. Gonzalez waived her right to the <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> properties and that her claim is barred by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and
prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">The preliminary issue raised by the private respondents as to the
timeliness of Mrs. Gonzalez' petition for review is <span style="">a closed matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in
its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="12"><span style="">December 16, 1971</span></st1:date><span style=""> denied respondents' motion to dismiss and
gave due course to the petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In an appeal under Republic Act No. 5440 only legal issues can be
raised under undisputed facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since on
the basis of the stipulated facts the lower court resolved only the issue of
whether the properties in question are subject to <span class="SpellE"><u>reserva</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>troncal</u></span>, that is the only legal issue to be
resolved in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other issues raised by the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
particularly those involving factual matters, cannot be re­solved in this
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial court did not pass
upon those issues, there is no ruling which can be reviewed by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether the disputed properties are <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> properties under article 891 of the Civil Code,
formerly article 811, and whether <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Roces</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> could dispose of them in her will in favor of her
grandchildren to the exclusion of her six children.</p>

<p class="BODY">Did Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> have the right to
convey <u>mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span></u> what she inherited from
her daughter <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span style="">to </span>the <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> within <span style="">the <u>third </u></span><u>degree</u> and to
bypass the <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> in the <u>second degree</u> or
should that inheritance automatically go to the <span class="SpellE">reservees</span>
in the second degree, the <span style="">six </span>children
of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As will hereinafter be
shown that is not a novel issue </span>or a question of first impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was resolved in <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>, 40 Phil. 480.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before discussing the applica­bility to this
case of the doctrine in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Florentino</u></span> case
and other pertinent rulings, it may be useful to make a brief dis­course on the
nature of <span class="SpellE"><u>reserva</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>troncal</u></span>,
also called <u>lineal, familiar, <span class="SpellE">extraordinaria</span> o
semi-<span class="SpellE">troncal</span></u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Much time, effort and
energy were spent by the parties in their five briefs in descanting on the
nature of <span class="SpellE"><u>reserva</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>troncal</u></span>,
which together with the <span class="SpellE"><u>reserva</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">viudal</span></u> and <u>reversion legal</u>, was abolished by the
Code Commission to prevent the decedent's estate from being entailed, to
eliminate the uncertainty in owner­ship caused by the reservation (which
uncertainty impedes the improvement of the <span class="SpellE">reservable</span>
property) </span>and <span style="">to discourage the </span>confinement
of property within a certain family for generations which situation allegedly
leads to economic oligarchy and is incompatible with the socialization of
ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Code Commission regarded the <span class="SpellE"><u>reservas</u></span>
as remnants of feudalism which fomented agrarian unrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, the <span class="SpellE"><u>reservas</u></span>,
insofar as they penalize legitimate rela­tionship, is considered unjust and
inequitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the lawmaking body, not agreeing entirely with the Code
Commission, restored the <span class="SpellE"><u>reserva</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>troncal</u></span>, a legal institution which, according to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city> and <span class="SpellE">Castan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tobeñas</span>, has provoked questions and doubts that are
difficult to resolve.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Reserva</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>troncal</u></span>

<span class="SpellE"><u>troncal</u></span> has been satisfied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"to prevent persons outside a family from
securing, by some special accident of life, property that would otherwise have
remained therein".</p>

<p class="BODY">That same contention was advanced in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Florentino</u></span>
case where the <span class="SpellE">reservor</span> willed the <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> properties to her daughter, a full-blood sister
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>prepositus</u></span> and ignored the other six <span class="SpellE">reservors</span>, the relatives of the half-blood of the <span class="SpellE"><u>prepositus</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rejecting that contention, this Court held that the <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> property bequeathed by the <span class="SpellE">reservor</span>
to her daughter does not form part of the <span class="SpellE">reservor's</span>
estate nor of the daughter's estate but should be given to all the seven <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> or nearest relatives of the <span class="SpellE"><u>prepositus</u></span>
within the third degree.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court noted that, while it is true that by giving the <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> property to only one <span class="SpellE">reservee</span>
it did not pass into the hands of strangers, nevertheless, it is likewise true
that the heiress of the <span class="SpellE">reservor</span> was <u>only one of
the <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> and there is no reason founded upon law
and justice why the other <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> should be
deprived of their shares in the <span class="SpellE">re­servable</span> property</u>
(pp. 894-5).</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying that doctrine to this case, it results that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> could not dispose of in her will the properties in
ques­tion even if the disposition is in favor of the relatives within the third
degree from <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said properties, by operation of article
891, should go to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda's</span> six children as <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> within the second degree from <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be repeated that the <span class="SpellE">reservees</span>
do not inherit from the <span class="SpellE">reservor</span> but from the <span class="SpellE"><u>prepositus</u></span>, of whom the <span class="SpellE">re­servees</span>
are the heirs <u>mortis</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span><u> </u>subject
to the condition that they must survive the <span class="SpellE">reservor</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Padura</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Baldovino</span>,
L-11960, December 27, 1958, 104 Phil. 1065).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court said that the disputed properties lost their <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> character due to the non-existence of
third-degree relatives of <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> at the time of the death of the <span class="SpellE">reservor</span>,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>, belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
family, "except third-degree relatives who pertain to both" the <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> lines.</p>

<p class="BODY">That holding is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reservation could have been extinguished only by the absence of <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> at the time of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legarda's</span>
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since at the time of her death,
there were (and still are) <span class="SpellE">reservees</span> belonging to the
second and third degrees, the disputed properties did not lose their <span class="SpellE">reservable</span> character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The disposition of the said properties should be made in accordance with
article 891 or the rule on <span class="SpellE"><u>reserva</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>troncal</u></span> and not in accordance with the <span class="SpellE">reservor's</span> holographic will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said properties did not form part of Mrs.
<span class="SpellE">Legarda's</span> estate (Cano vs. Director of Lands, 105
Phil. 1, 4).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the lower court's decision is reversed and set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hereby adjudged that the
properties inheri­ted by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> from her
daughter <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>,
with all the fruits and accessions thereof, are <span class="SpellE">reservable</span>
properties which belong to Beatriz, Rosario, Teresa, Benito, Alejandro and
Jose, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> y <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>,
as <span class="SpellE">reservees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The shares of Rosario L. Valdes and Benito F. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>,
who died in 1969 and 1973, respectively, should pertain to their respective
