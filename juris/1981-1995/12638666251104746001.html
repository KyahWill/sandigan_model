				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Is the dismissal of an employee for breach of trust and loss of
confidence proper? This is the issue in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is employed as salesman by private respondent Pepsi
Cola Distributors of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with a monthly salary of P1<span class="GramE">,441.85</span> and cost of living
allowance in the amount of P510.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1985</st1:date>
petitioner was placed under preventive suspension for alleged violation of
company rules and regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY">An administrative investigation was conducted by private
respondent wherein it was found among others, that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) petitioner created fictitious credit
extensions in the account of Chin <span class="SpellE">Chin</span> Store by
forging the signature of its owner, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>; and
(2) petitioner failed to remit the collections in the amount of P16,857.50.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1986</st1:date>
private respondent dismissed petitioner from the service for violation of
company rules and regulations, breach of trust and loss of confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of petitioner's preventive
suspension was considered service without pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed a complaint for illegal dismissal in the
National Labor Relations Commission wherein in due course, on October 7, 1988,
labor arbiter Ariel C. Santos rendered a decision directing the reinstatement
of petitioner to his former position with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and without loss of seniority rights from July 14, 1986 until actual
reinstatement, and further of all the sums owing to petitioner is also awarded
to him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent appealed to the respondent National Labor
Relations Commission (NLRC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1989</st1:date> respondent NLRC
rendered its decision reversing the appealed decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration thereof filed by
petitioner was denied by the NLRC on <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="11">November
 10, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>, which was
erroneously denominated as a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, wherein
petitioner alleges that the respondent <span class="GramE">NLRC</span> committed
the following alleged errors:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">"I</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THAT THE
RESPONDENT NLRC DID NOT ACQUIRE ANY JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S
APPEAL BEFORE THEM;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">II<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GRANTING THAT IT HAS
JURISDICTION THE RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR WHEN IT DISREGARDED
THE CONCLUSION REACHED BY HONORABLE LABOR ARBITER ARIEL <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>
INSPITE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">III</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THAT THE RESPONDENT
NLRC COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR WHEN IT <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">IMPOSED
THE SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE </span>PENALTY OF DISMISSAL ON YOUR PETITIONER;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">IV</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>THAT THE RESPONDENT NLRC BREACHED THE
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AGAINST CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMEMT;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">V</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>AND LASTLY, THE
RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR IN NOT AFFIRMING THE LABOR ARBITER'S
DECISION OF <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="10">OCTOBER 7, 1988</st1:date>
IN FAVOR OF YOUR PETITIONER.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">No doubt the NLRC has
appellate jurisdiction over the decision of the labor arbiter which is being assailed
to be erroneous and not supported by the evidence constituting as it does a
grave abuse of discretion.</span><sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;color:red">1</span></sup><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In this case respondent
NLRC did not err in disregarding the conclusions reached by the labor arbiter
because its findings are not supported by substantial evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner admits that he
delivered Pepsi Cola products to the store of Mr. Martin <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">2593
  <span class="SpellE">Beata</span> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, on April 2 and 12, 1985, but he made it
appear that the products were delivered to Chin <span class="SpellE">Chin</span>
store. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>He also admitted having failed to
remit part of his collections amounting to P16<span class="GramE">,857.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner advances the lame excuse that he was only acting upon
instructions of his supervisor, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and he
did not want to incur the ire of his superior for fear of being dismissed from
the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming his claim to be true, he had no duty to follow
instructions of his superior that is not only anomalous and contrary to rules
and regulations of the company but is certainly unlawful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead he should have reported the matter to
higher authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In electing to obey
the unlawful instructions of his superior he thereby assumed responsibility for
his acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was duly investigated by the private respondent
for these infractions of the rules and regulations of the company and after
having been afforded due process he was dismissed from the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">No doubt it is the right of an employer to dismiss an employee
for breach of trust and loss of confidence as in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The security of tenure accorded to labor
under the Constitution does not embrace infractions of the rules amounting to
breach of trust and loss of confidence as in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
