for review the Decision dated July 8, 1985 </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We adopt the facts as
narrated in the People's brief and </span>found by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the Court of Appeals to be substantially supported by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Between <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1977" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1977</st1:date>, a certain <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> or Jose <span class="SpellE">Agosto</span> <span class="SpellE">Labayo</span> was standing beside a jeep near <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Loleng's</span> Store at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Montalban</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Pansol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Balara</span>, Q. C., when <span class="SpellE">Adelino</span> Montanez approached <span class="GramE">him.;</span>
Montanez was accompanied by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cayanong</span> (pp. 7,
9-10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="9">Sept.
 22, 1977</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Montanez poked
his gun at <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, specifically very near the latter's
right nipple.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cayanong</span>
also had a gun which was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">drawn and </span>pointed
at <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While his gun was thus aimed at <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, Montanez
remarked, `<span class="SpellE">sabihin</span> mo <span class="SpellE">lamang</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">na</span></span> <span class="SpellE">papuputukin</span>
<span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">ito</span> at <span class="SpellE">papuputukin</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>’ (you tell <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">me if I will fire </span>this and I will do
it).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>
replied, `<span class="SpellE">hindi</span> <span class="SpellE">baleng</span> <span class="SpellE">paputukin</span> mo, <span class="SpellE">basta</span> <span class="SpellE">wala</span> <span class="SpellE">akong</span> <span class="SpellE">kasalanan</span>'
(never mind if you fire the gun, anyway I have no fault).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Montanez then fired (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, October 6, 1977) and <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>
slumped, after which Montanez told <span class="SpellE">Cayanong</span>, `<st1:place>Tara</st1:place>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">na</span></span>, pare, <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> '<span class="SpellE">yan</span>
(Let's go, he's dead already).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The two then ran away towards the NWSS compound at <span class="SpellE">Balara</span> (pp. 14-18, 20-21, 24, 40, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="9">Sept. 22, 1977</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Montanez and <span class="SpellE">Cayanong</span>
were actually security guards at the <span class="SpellE">Balara</span> compound
(p. 28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both were in their uniforms at the time of the shooting (pp. 44-45, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that before the shooting happened, somebody threw
stones at Montanez <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and the latter
suspected <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> to have done it (pp. 29, 38-39, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">October 6, </span>1977</st1:date>; pp. 22,

 10, 1977</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Montanez was also
drunk at the time he shot <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> (p. 44, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An autopsy was made on the body of Jose ‘<span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>’
<span class="SpellE">Agosto</span> on <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="5">May
 27, 1977</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="45" hour="11">11:45 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning by Dr. Nieto M. Salvador, medico-legal officer of the National
Bureau of Investigation (pp. 65-66, 71, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="2">Feb. 16, 1978</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His Necropsy Report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
K) <span class="GramE">showed</span> that the victim sustained a gun-shot wound
on the front aspect, right side of the chest which measured around 1 x 9 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>. <span class="GramE">in</span> diameter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The edges of the wound were <span class="SpellE">everted</span> and around these <span class="SpellE">everted</span>
edges was gun powder smudge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
presence of the gun powder smudge indicated that the shooting was a ‘<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">contact fire’ i.e., that the gun was close to
the entrance of the bullet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on the
measurements of the entrance and exit wounds, the bullet would have a caliber
of around .22 </span>to .<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">38 <span class="GramE">caliber</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bullet
completely perforated the aorta or the main blood vessel which supplies the
whole system of the body, thus, even if the victim was properly attended to, he
would not have survived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The immediate
cause of death was hemorrhage, acute, severe, </span><span class="GramE">secondary</span>
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">gunshot wound of the chest (pp. 65,
66, 71-72, 75-82, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Id).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Investigation conducted by <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> revealed that
the gun that was fired belonged </span>to Montanez (pp. 12, 4-5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="9">Sept. 8, 1980</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the time of his death, <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> was<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span> working as mechanic driver and earning P300.00
a month for a period of almost five years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For his funeral expenses excluding the cemetery lot, his mother spent P4<span class="GramE">,300.00</span> plus P900.00 as interment expense, and others for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the wake and transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And for filing the case against <span class="SpellE">Totoy's</span> assailants, his mother contracted </span>to pay
attorney's fees of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Totoy’s</span> death
brought untold sorrow to his mother who was initially shocked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to hear of her son's sudden death (pp. 3,
9-19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">November 9, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

to kill, attack, assault and employ personal violence upon one JOSE AGOSTO Y
LABAYO, by then and there shooting him at his chest, thereby inflicting upon
said JOSE AGOSTO Y LABAYO serious and mortal wound which was the direct and
immediate cause of his death, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to </span>the

by way of actual and other damages." (p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-petitioner entered a plea of not guilty on
arraignment and after trial on the <span class="GramE">merits,</span> the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1983</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court finds ADELINO MONTANEZ Y ROSAS
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide but considering the

the said accused to a penalty of SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY OF PRISION MAYOR
as the minimum to EIGHT (8) YEARS OF PRISION MAYOR <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

accused Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cayanong</span> is concerned, the evidence
does not warrant conviction as it is not sufficient to prove beyond reasonable

the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Adelino</span> Montanez is hereby ordered to pay Alicia <span class="SpellE">Agosto</span>, mother of the victim, the sum of 12,000.00 due to
the latter's death and P9,900.00 representing actual damages corresponding to
the expenses incurred during the wake, vigil and interment of victim <span class="SpellE">Agosto</span>, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed the aforesaid decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Court of Appeals which affirmed the same with certain modifications and
also denied reconsideration of subject decision in its Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">September
 18, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner thus resorted
to this petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner now assails
the Court of Appeals for having committed these errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in adjudging Montanez guilty of the crime of homicide despite the
prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in not sustaining Montanez's plea of self-defense.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in declaring admissible Montanez's extracted extrajudicial admission in
violation of his Miranda rights.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in not crediting Montanez with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary
surrender.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot find merit in petitioners averments; more so because
respondents' case has been well and ably buttressed by the Solicitor
General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor are we inclined to disturb
the findings and conclusion of the respondent appellate court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certain facts have thus been competently and
sufficiently established.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that petitioner-accused never denied that the
fatal shot came from his gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
investigation conducted by <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> revealed that the gun fired belong to Montanez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony, <span class="SpellE">Det</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> was positive that it was the gun of petitioner
which fired since it smelled of gunpowder immediately after the shooting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>,
<st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1980</st1:date>, pp. 4-5).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's claim of self-defense and his version that while he
was struggling and grappling with the victim for the gun, it went off hitting
the victim, are categorically discredited by his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Cayanon</span>
who denied that he ever saw the victim with a knife nor that he ever told
petitioner to run because the victim was allegedly advancing with a knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be
</span>noted that there was not even an attempt on the part of petitioner to
support his theory of self defense by producing in evidence the alleged
knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How could he when there was no
such weapon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the Necropsy Report of Medico-Legal Officer of the
NBI negates the theory of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For,
the Report indicated that the Victim sustained a gun-shot wound on the front
aspect, right side of the chest which measured around 1 x 9 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>.
<span class="GramE">in</span> diameter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The edges of the wound were <span class="SpellE">everted</span> and around
these <span class="SpellE">everted</span> edges was gun powder smudge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presence of the gun powder smudge
indicated that the shooting was a "contact fire" (that the gun was
close to the entrance of the bullet).</p>

<p class="BODY">On petitioner's averment that the varying testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses relating to the statement he uttered before the shooting
incident should not have been given credence by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We quote, as the Court of Appeals did, the
well-considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">refutation </span>by
the Solicitor General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"The varying testimonies’ alluded to by appellant refer to the
statement uttered by him before the shooting incident as testified to by the
prosecution witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution
witness Fernando <span class="SpellE">Abano</span> testified in court that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">appellant said, "<span class="SpellE">sabihin</span>
mo <span class="SpellE">lamang</span> at <span class="SpellE">papuputukin</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">ito</span>." However in his
sworn statement to the police it appears that what he said he heard was "<span class="SpellE">sumagot</span> ka <span class="SpellE">lamang</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">oo</span>, <span class="SpellE">titirahin</span>
<span class="SpellE">kita</span>." And when asked in court to clarify which
statement <span class="GramE">be</span> really heard that appellant say, <span class="SpellE">Abano</span> said, "<span class="SpellE">Sumagot</span> ka <span class="SpellE">lamang</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">oo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">papuputukin</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>." We
submit that the three statements given by <span class="SpellE">Abano</span> as
above shown, do not necessarily vary or differ in substance as to make him an
incredible witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inconsistencies
which refer to minor details are badges of truth (People v. <span class="SpellE">Paculba</span>,
124 SCRA 383).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, too, this Court declared in the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Sarol</span> (139 SCRA 127) that the issue is really one of
credibility of witnesses and we need only reiterate the fundamental rule:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"In raising <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the </span>issue of which version to accept and believe, petitioner has
to content with the oft-repeated fundamental rule in criminal as well as civil
cases that in the matter of credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial
court are given great weight and the highest degree of respect by the appellate
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason of course, is that the
trial court is in a better position to decide the question, having seen and
heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of
testifying during the trial."</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Naz</span>
(138 SCRA 426) this Court held that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"In an attempt to discredit the testimony of the witnesses for the
prosecution, counsel for the appellant pointed to some inconsistencies and
contradictions in their<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>testimony
which he believes militate strongly against the credibility of said witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contradictions and inconsistencies,
however, refer to minor details which would not impair their credibility."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Considering the foregoing,</b> the judgment appealed from is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">hereby </span>AFFIRMED, with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the modification that the penalty is hereby</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">modified
