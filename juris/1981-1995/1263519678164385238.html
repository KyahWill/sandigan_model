Since then, his occupancy was open, continuous and without molestation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or </span>interference
from anyone, much less from appellant. He introduced improvements thereon,
i.e.; his house, an annex thereto for restaurant and store purposes, a <span class="SpellE">pumpwell</span>, and a fence around the premises.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant claims that this portion of the land, together with
a house used as a shed for drying leaf tobacco, was ceded by her in 1952 to
Esquivel on a temporary basis as the latter had no place to live in; that one
time she sent her son to cut bamboos behind that house but Esquivel objected
and claimed that he owned the land and forth<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">with told appellant's son to get out <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>;
and that she requested Esquivel to pay P30.00 for the use of the lot, and

of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Cullanan</span> a
deed of sale covering the portion herein-before described. In that deed,
Exhibit 1, appellant warranted that she was the absolute owner of the portion
sold, the same being her share of the conjugal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">partnership with her late husband <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>. She never mentioned in that document that said

this writing. </span>When confronted with her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
thereon, she stated in varying terms that she 'Probably' executed that
document, or that 'I do not know whether that is my <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>,'
or that 'I doubt if I impressed my <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>.' The
obvious weakness of this explanation prevents us from accepting the same. Exhibit
1 is a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> document. A rule so well settled as
to require citation of authorities is that which says that oral evidence to
overcome a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> document must be clear,
convincing and beyond a mere preponderance. Here, appellant's evidence -- her
sole testimony -- is notches below the legal yardstick.</blockquote>

disposition of her rights as a free patent applicant which is sanctioned by
