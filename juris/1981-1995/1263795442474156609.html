<p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, seeking the 
reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1981" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1981</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the resolution (decision) of the Social Security 
Commission in SSC Case No. 3272 is hereby set aside and another one 
entered:<span>&nbsp; </span>ordering respondent <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> 
Transit, Inc. to remit to the Social Security Commission the premium 
contributions for the petitioner for the years 1958 to May 1963 and from 1967 to 
March 1971, inclusive, plus penalties thereon at the rate of 3% per month of 
delinquency."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Two passenger bus lines with similar buses and similar routes were 
being operated by firm names "<span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit" and 
"<span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit, Inc." <span class="GramE">(BTI) the 
herein petitioner.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The former was owned by the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> who continued to 
operate it until his death on <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="1">January 
26, 1972</st1:date>, while the latter was owned by <span class="GramE">petitioner 
corporation</span>, incorporated in the year 1968 and existing until the present 
time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both bus lines operate under different grants of franchises 
by the Public Service Commission (Brief for Petitioner, p. 11), but were issued 
only one ID Number 03-22151 by the Social Security <span>System </span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 66).</p>
<p class="BODY">Private respondent claiming to be an employee of both bus lines 
with one ID Number, filed a petition with the Social Security Commission on 
August 14, 1975 which was docketed as SSC Case No. 3272 to compel BTI to remit 
to the Social Security System private respondent's SSS Premium contributions for 
the years 1958 to March, 1963 and from 1967 to March, 1971.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
alleged that he was employed by petitioner from 1947 to 1971 as conductor and 
later as inspector with corresponding salary increases and that petitioner 
deducted from his salaries, premium contributions, but what was remitted to the 
SSS was only for a period covering June, 1963 to 1966, at a much lesser 
amount.</p>
<p class="BODY">In its answer, BTI denied having employed private respondent Ramon 
Martinez, the truth being that he was employed by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> who since 1948 
owned and operated buses under the trade name <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> 
Transit which were separate and distinct from the buses operated by <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> owned by Mrs. Victoria <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de</em> <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both bus lines had different offices, 
different maintenance and repair shops, garages, books of account, and 
managers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The employment of private respondent lasted until 1971 
when his employer <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> became bankrupt.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was the latter 
which deducted from private respondent the amount corresponding to his SSS 
contributions for the years in question but allegedly did not remit the 
same.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally, herein petitioner BTI claims that private 
respondent allowed <span>17 years to elapse and at a time </span><span>when 
</span><span class="SpellE"><span>Pascual</span></span><span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Tuazon</span></span><span> was already </span><span>dead 
before filing the subject petition with the Social Security Commission.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
18).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the Social Security Commission on 
<st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1979</st1:date>, entered 
a resolution in SSC Case No. 3272, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> 
portion of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Commission finds and so holds that there 
existed <span>no employer-employee </span>relationship between the petitioner 
and respondent as would warrant further remittance of SSS contributions for and 
in behalf of petitioner Roman Martinez.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Consequently, this petition is hereby dismissed for lack of 
merit.<span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> 
<p class="BODY"><span>On appeal, the Court of Appeals finding that the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Tuazon</span></span><span> </span><span>operated his buses 
under the "<span class="SpellE">Kabit</span>" System, reversed and set aside the 
foregoing resolution as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>"WHEREFORE, the resolution 
(decision) of the Social Security Commission in SSC Case No. 3272 is hereby set 
aside and another one entered ordering respondent <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit, Inc. to remit to the <span>Social Security 
Commission the premium contributions for the petitioner for the years 1958 to 
May 1963 and from 1967 to March 1971, inclusive, plus penalties thereon at the 
rate of 3% per month of delinquency.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span>"SO

<p class="BODY"><span>Herein petitioner filed a Motion </span><span>for

</span>The </span><span>brief for </span><span>petitioner-appellant was filed on 
March 27, 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 89) while private 
respondent filed a manifestation and motion to be excused for not filing private 
respondent's brief and to be allowed to adopt as his arguments the comments he 
filed on September 19, 1981 and his brief with the Court of Appeals (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 92).<span>&nbsp; </span>Said manifestation and

<span>BALIWAG TRANSIT, INC.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>However, the main issue in this c</span>ase <span>is whether 
or not the issuance by the Social Security System of one SSS-ID-Number to two 
bus lines necessarily indicates that one of <span class="GramE">them,</span> 
operates his buses under the "<span class="SpellE">Kabit</span> 
System".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The answer is in the negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The "<span class="SpellE">Kabit</span> System" has been 
defined by the </span><span>Supreme </span><span>Court as an 
arrangement</span><span> </span><span>"whereby a person who has </span>been 
<span>granted a certificate of convenience allows another person who owns motor 
</span>vehicles <span>to operate under such franchise for a fee." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Lita</em></span><em> Enterprises, Inc. 
v.</em></span><em> Second Civil Cases Division, IAC, et al.</em>, G.R. No. 
64693, </span><st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="4"><span>April 27, 
1984</span></st1:date><span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The determining factor, </span>therefore, is <span>the 
possession of a franchise to operate which negates the existence of the "<span class="SpellE">Kabit</span> </span><span>System" </span><span>and not the issuance 
of one SSS ID Number for both bus lines from which the existence of said system 
was inferred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the instant case, the findings of the Court of Appeals 
are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span>"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is very obvious from the foregoing narration of facts 
that the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, during the time material to this case, operated 
<span>his buses under the "<span class="SpellE"><em>kabit</em></span>" system; 
that is, while actually he was the owner and operator of public utility buses, 
maintaining his own drivers, conductors, inspectors and other employees, his 
buses were not registered with the Public Service Commission (now the Bureau of 
Land Transportation) in his own name.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, his buses were 
absorbed and registered </span><span>as owned </span><span>and operated by the 
"<span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit", which was the firm name owned and 
used by his niece, Victoria <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de</em> 
<span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>"It is well settled that the findings of facts of the Court 
of Appeals x </span><span class="SpellE"><span>x</span></span><span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span>x</span></span><span> </span><span>are conclusive on the 
parties and on this Court, unless:<span>&nbsp; </span><span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>(2) the inference made

are contrary to those of the trial court; <span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Sacay</em></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">v. 
</span><span class="SpellE"><em>Sandiganbayan</em></span>, G.R. No. 66497-98, July 
10, 1986).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case at bar, it is undisputed that as testified to, 
not only by seven (7) witnesses presented by the petitioner but also by the 
Social Security System witness <span class="SpellE">Mangowan</span> <span class="SpellE">Macalaba</span>, Clerk I, of the R &amp; A Division of the Board of 
Transportation, </span><span>who </span><span>had access to the records of said 
office with respect to </span><span>applications and </span>grant of 
<span>franchises of public utility vehicles, that Victoria </span><span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;">. de 
</span><span><span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> and </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Pascual</span></span><span> <span class="SpellE"><span>Tuazon</span></span><span> </span>were </span><span>granted 
separate franchises to operate public utility buses, under Cases Nos. 15904, 
114913, 11564, 103366, 64157 and 65894 for the former and Case No. 69-4592 and 
Case No. 697775 for the latter, both operating between Manila and <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span> routes.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the franchises of 
<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> were 
cancelled on </span><st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="12"><span>December 16, 
1971</span></st1:date><span> and </span><st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="5"><span>May </span><span>14, 1972</span></st1:date><span> respectively 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 22), when the latter terminated 
his operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is thus evident that both bus lines operated under their 
own franchises but opted to retain the firm name "<span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit" with slight modification, by the inclusion 
of the word "Inc." in the case of herein petitioner, obviously to take advantage 
of the goodwill such firm name enjoys with the riding public.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Conversely, the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, during the time 
material to this case operated his buses under the "<span class="SpellE">Kabit</span> System" on the ground that while he was actually the 
owner and operator, his buses were </span><span>not </span><span>registered with 
the Public Service Commission </span><span>(now </span><span>the Bureau of Land 
Transportation) in his own name, is not supported by the records.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Much less can it be said that there is an analogy between the case at bar 
and the cited case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Doligosa</em></span><em>, et al. v. 
Decolongon, et al.</em> (3 CA Nos. 1135, 1142-43) to the extent that <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit, Inc. being the ostensible operator of the 
buses actually owned by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, should be held liable for the contributions 
collected or ought to be collected from private respondent (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 53-54), presumably to discourage the 
proliferating "<span class="SpellE">Kabit</span> System" in public utility 
vehicles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">While it is admitted that petitioner was the one who remitted the 
SSS premiums of private respondent, it has <span>also </span>been established by 
testimonies of witnesses that such arrangement was done purposely to accommodate 
the request of the <span>late </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Pascual</span></span><span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, 
</span>the uncle of Victoria <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de</em> 
<span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> and the money came from him.<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
the <span>other </span>hand, there is no reason why such testimonies should not 
be given credence as the records <span>fail </span>to show that said witnesses 
have any motive or reason to falsify or perjure their testimonies (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 23-24).</p>
<p class="BODY">Moreover, the Social Security Commission after several hearings 
had been conducted, arrived at the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>"It was established during the hearings that petitioner Roman 
Martinez was employed by, worked for and took orders from <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and was authorized 
to get 'vales' from the conductors of the trucks of Mr. <span class="SpellE"><span>Tuazon</span></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>This was 
admitted got 'vales' from the buses of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> (TSN <span>pp. 24-25, May 7, 1976 and Exhibits "3" to 
"49").<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"On the other hand, there is no evidence introduced to show that 
petitioner ever received salaries from respondent or from Mrs. Victoria <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>.</em> <span class="GramE"><em>de</em></span> 
<span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> and neither had he been under the orders of the 
latter.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The only basis upon which petitioner 
anchors his claim despite his actual employment by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> was the use by the 
latter of the trade name, <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit, in the 
operation of his (Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon's</span>) own buses which the 
latter had every reason to do since he laboriously <span>helped and organized 
said firm until it gained cognizance by the 
public.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"It is, therefore, clear that even long before the incorporation of 
the <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit in 1968 petitioner was already an 
employee of the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> who despite having separate office, employees and 
buses which were operated under the line of the <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit did not report him for coverage to the 
SSS.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sadly enough, petitioner who claims to be an employee of the 
respondent did not refute, by way of submitting rebuttal evidence, the 
testimonies given by respondent's witnesses that he was an employee of the late 
<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and not of 
said respondent or of Mrs. Victoria <span class="SpellE"><span>Tuazon</span></span><span> and not of said respondent or of 
Mrs. Victoria <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de</em> <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is a reasonable basis to 
believe that he would not attempt to do so if only to be consistent with his 
stand when he filed a case before the National Labor Relations Commission, a 
claim against both the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and the respondent.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is now 
concentrating his action against the respondent in view of the death of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> who during his 
lifetime sold his trucks and became bankrupt Exhibit "2") — Resolution, 
September 14, 1979, pp. 29-31)." (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
28-30)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>It has been uniformly held by this Court that it is 
sufficient that administrative findings of fact are supported by evidence on the 
record, or stated negatively, it is sufficient that findings of fact are not 
shown to be unsupported by evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Court has also held further that "in reviewing 
administrative decisions, the reviewing court cannot re-examine the sufficiency 
of the evidence as if originally instituted therein, and receive additional 
evidence that was not submitted to the administrative agency concerned.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The findings of fact must be respected, so long as they are supported by 
substantial evidence, even if not overwhelming or preponderant." </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Police Commission v. Lood</em>, 127 SCRA 758 [1984].</span></p>
<p class="BODY">Thus, the employer-employee relationship between the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and herein private 
respondent, having been established, the remittance of SSS contributions of the 
latter, is the responsibility of his employer <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, 
regardless of the existence or non-existence of the "<span class="SpellE">Kabit</span> System".</p>
<p class="BODY">Moreover, private respondent having allowed seventeen (17) 
<span>years </span>to elapse before filing his petition with the Social Security 
System, has undoubtedly slept on his rights and his cause of action has already 
prescribed under Article 1144(2) of the Civil Code (<em>Central Azucarrera del 
Davao v. Court of Appeals</em>, 137 SCRA 296 [1985]; applied by analogy).</p>
