				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, petitioner Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) asserts its preferential right as a foreclosing
creditor over private respondents' claims for separation pay against Republic
Hardwood, Inc. (RHI).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 14, 1986, the private respondents filed with the
Provincial Extension Office of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in
Daet, Camarines Norte seventeen individual complaints against RHI for unpaid
wages and separation pay.  These
complaints were thereafter endorsed to the Regional Arbitration Branch (Branch
V of Legaspi City) of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) since the
petitioners had already been terminated from employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its position paper dated March 1987, RHI alleged that it had
ceased to operate in 1983 due to the government ban against tree cutting.  It further alleged that in May 24, 1981, its
sawmill was totally burned resulting in enormous losses and that due to its
financial setbacks, RHI failed to pay its loan with the DBP.  RHI contended that since DBP foreclosed its
mortgaged assets on September 24, 1985, then any adjudication of monetary
claims in favor of its former employees must be satisfied against DBP.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 29, 1987, the private respondents filed a motion to
implied DBP.  On July 13, 1987, DBP filed
its opposition to said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 28, 1988, Executive Labor Arbiter Gelacio Rivera
rendered a joint decision on the complaints, the relevant and dispositive
portions of which read:</p>

<blockquote>"To say that workers of bankrupt or insolvent employers must
first file an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding against the latter before
their unpaid workers may be satisfied will cause additional burden, unnecessary
expenses, unwanted hardship which are conditions not so intended under the
Social Justice policy of the State.  x x
x. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x To require petitioners to file insolvency proceedings
against RHI and later file against DBP their claims is to prolong the agony of
petitioners.  To give a technical and
legal meaning to the words of Art. 110 is to subvert the rights of the
petitioners.  We hold therefore that as
against the contention of respondent DBP, Art. 4 of the Labor Code is the
answer.  The social justice clause of
the Constitution is our guide."</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment <span style="">is </span>hereby rendered in favor of
petitioners and adversely against respondent Republic Hardwood, Inc. and
Development Bank of the Philippines, ordering the latter to jointly and
severally pay petitioners the amount of P59,610.00 as separation pay within ten
(10) days upon receipt of this Decision through this Regional Arbitration
Branch.  Further, respondents are
ordered to pay the amount of P308.00 as deposit fee pursuant to PD 1177 under
Budget Circular No. 304 and Secs. 4 and 8 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 230.  (Rollo, pp. 38, 40-41)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">DBP appealed to the NLRC which rendered a decision on April 15,
1991 affirming the labor arbiter's judgment.  DBP filed a motion for reconsideration which was likewise dismissed by
the NLRC on May 17, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner alleges that the NLRC committed grave abuse of
discretion in issuing the assailed decision dated April 15, 1991 and its
resolution of May 17, 1991 and raises the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the Joint Decision of Executive
Labor Arbiter Gelacio L. Rivera is violative of procedural due process on the
part of DBP;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the complainant-private
respondents are entitled to separation pay;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there was retroactive
application of Executive Order No. 81 in this case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not Executive Labor Arbiter Gelacio
L. Rivera and the NLRC correctly applied Article 110 of the Labor Code in this
case; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there is a basis for the NLRC
(Labor Arbiter Rivera) to order the payment of deposit fee." (Rollo, pp.
17-18)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">DBP asserts that it was deprived of due process since there was
no formal order impleading it in the complaints against RHI.  Moreover, DBP points out, the cases were
never set for hearing thus depriving it of the opportunity to peruse the
documentary evidence of the complainants and to confront the complainants'
witnesses.  Additionally, DBP was not
given an opportunity to present its own evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to this contention of DBP.  Denial of due process means the total lack
of opportunity to be heard.  There is no
denial of due process where a party is given an opportunity to be heard and to
present his case.  The petitioner in
this case filed an opposition to the motion to implead it as a party defendant.  It likewise filed a motion for
reconsideration of the labor arbiter's decision.  Thereafter, DBP filed an appeal with the NLRC and, later on, a
motion for reconsideration of the NLRC decision.  The petitioner, thus, was given ample opportunity to present its
case.  It was not denied due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to DBP's contention that the workers are not
entitled to separation pay.  Despite the
enormous losses incurred by RHI due to the fire that gutted the sawmill in 1981
and despite the logging ban in 1983, the uncontroverted claims for separation
pay show that most of the private respondents still worked up to the end of
1985 (See Rollo, p. 39).  RHI would
still have continued its business had not the petitioner foreclosed all of its
assets and properties on September 24, 1985.  Thus, the closure of RHI's business was not primarily brought about by
serious business losses.  Such closure
was a consequence of DBP's foreclosure of RHI's assets.  We therefore apply Article 283 which
provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">"x x x in cases of closures or cessation of operations of
establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial
reverses, the separation pay shall be <span style="">equ</span>ivalent
to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of
service, whichever is higher.  x x
x"</p>

<p class="BODY">However, because of the petitioner's assertion that the labor
arbiter and respondent NLRC incorrectly applied the provisions of Article 110
of the Labor Code, we are constrained to grant the petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 110, prior to its amendment by Republic Act No. 6715,
reads:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 110.  <u>Worker</u> <u>preference</u>
<u>in</u> <u>case</u> <u>of</u> <u>bankruptcy</u>. - In the event of bankruptcy
or liquidation of an employer's business, his workers shall enjoy first
preference as regards wages due them for services rendered during the period
prior to the bankruptcy or liquidation, any provision of law to the contrary
notwithstanding.  Unpaid wages shall be
paid in full before other creditors may establish any claim to a share in the
assets of the employer.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 10, Rule VIII, Book III of the Implementing Rules and
Regulations of the Labor Code states:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 10. <u>Payment</u> <u>of</u> <u>wages</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>case</u> <u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>bankruptcy</u>. - Unpaid wages
earned by the employees before the decla<span style="">r</span>ation
of bankruptcy or judicial liquidation of the employer's business shall be given
first preference and shall be paid in full before other creditors may establish
any claim to a share in the assets of the employer.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Republic v. Peralta</u>, 150 SCRA 37 (1987), the Court held
that the term "wages" includes separation pay.  But the Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Article 110 of the Labor Code, in determining the reach of
its terms, cannot be viewed in isolation.  Rather, Article 110 must be read in relation to the provisions of the
Civil Code concerning the classification, concurrence and preference of
credits, which provisions find particular application in insolvency proceedings
where the claims of all creditors, preferred or non-preferred, may be
adjudicated in a binding manner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly stressed that before the workers' preference
provided by Article 110 <span style="">may </span>be
invoked, there must first be a declaration of bankruptcy or a judicial
liquidation of the employer's business.  (See DBP v. Minister of Labor, 195 SCRA 463 [1991]; DBP v. NLRC, 186
SCRA 841 [1990]; DBP v. NLRC, 183 SCRA 328 [1990]; DBP v. Secretary of Labor,
179 SCRA 630 [1989]; DBP v. Santos, 171 SCRA 138 [1989]; Republic v. Peralta, <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="">DBP</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>v</u>. <u><span style="">Santos</span></u><span style="">, <u>supra</u>,
the Court discussed the import of Article 110 and Section 10 of </span><span style="">Rule </span><span style="">VIII, Book III and stated:</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is quite clear from the provisions that a <u>declaration</u>
of bankruptcy or a <u>judicial</u> <u>liquidation</u> must be present before
the worker's preference may be enforced.  Thus, Article 110 of the Labor Code and its implementing rule cannot be
invoked by the respondents in this case absent a formal declaration of
bankruptcy or a liquidation order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

<blockquote>"Moreover, the reason behind the necessity for a judicial
proceeding or a proceeding in rem before the concurrence and preference of
credits may be applied was explained by this Court in the case of <u>Philippines</u>
<u>Savings</u> <u>Bank</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Lantin</u> <u>(124</u> <u>SCRA</u> <u>476</u>
<u>[1983])</u>.  We said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The proceedings in the court below do not partake of the nature of
the insolvency proceedings or settlement of a decedent's estate.  The action filed by Ramos was only to
collect the unpaid cost of the construction of the duplex apartment.  It is far from being a general liquidation
of the estate of the Tabligan spouses.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'Insolvency proceedings and settlement of a decedent's estate are
both proceedings in rem which are binding against the whole<br>
world.  All persons having interest in
the subject matter involved, whether they were notified or not, are equally
bound.  Consequently, a liquidation of
similar import or other equivalent general liquidation must also necessarily be
a proceeding in rem so that all interested persons whether known to the parties
or not may be bound by such proceeding.</p>

<p class="2Q">'In the case at bar, although the lower court found that ‘there
were no known creditors other than the plaintiff and the defendant<br>
herein’, this can not be conclusive.  It
will not bar other creditors in the event they show up and present their claims
against the petitioner bank, claiming that they also have preferred liens
against the property involved.  Consequently, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 101864 issued in favor
of the bank which is supposed to be indefeasible would remain constantly unstable
and questionable.  Such could not have
been the intention of Article 2243 of the Civil Code although it considers
claims and credits under Article 2242 as statutory liens.  Neither does the <u>De</u> <u>Barreto</u>
case x x x.’</p>

<blockquote>"The claims of all creditors whether preferred or
non-preferred, the identification of the preferred ones and the totality of the
employer's asset should be brought into the picture.  There can then be an authoritative, fair, and binding
adjudication instead of the piece meal settlement which would result from the
questioned decision in this case." (At pp. 144-145)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC, therefore, committed grave abuse of discretion when it
affirmed the labor arbiter's ruling that the workers' preference espoused in
Article 110 may <span style="">be </span>applied even in the absence of a declaration of bankruptcy or
a liquidation order.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must also emphasize that DBP's lien on RHI's mortgaged assets,
being a mortgage credit, is a special preferred credit under Article 2242 of
the Civil Code while the workers' preference is an ordinary preferred credit
under Article 2244.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <u>DBP</u><span style=""> <u>v</u>. <u>NLRC</u>, (<u>sup</u></span><u>ra</u>)
it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"4.  A distinction
should be made between a preference of credit and a lien.  A preference applies only to claims which do
not attach to specific properties.  A
lien creates a charge on a particular property.  The right of first preference as regards unpaid wages recognized
by Article 110 does not constitute a lien on the property of the insolvent
debtor in favor of workers.  It is but a
preference of credit in their favor, a preference in application.  It is a method adopted to determine and
specify the order in which credits should be paid in the final distribution of
the proceeds of the insolvent's assets.  It is a right to a first preference in the discharge of the funds of the
judgment debtor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the words of Republic v. Peralta, supra.</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Article 110 of the Labor Code does not purport to create a lien in
favor of workers or employees for unpaid wages either upon all of the
properties or upon any particular property owned by their employer.  Claims for unpaid wages do not therefore
fall at all within the category of specially preferred claims established under
Articles 2241 and 2242 of the Civil Code, <u>except</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>extent</u>
<u>that</u> <u>such</u> <u>claims</u> <u>for</u> <u>unpaid</u> <u>wages</u> <u>are</u>
<u>already</u> <u>covered</u> <u>by</u><span style=""> </span><u>Article</u>
<u>2241,</u> <u>number</u> <u>6</u>: ‘claims for laborers’ wages, on the goods
manufactured or the work done; <u>or</u> <u>by</u> <u>Article</u> <u>2242,</u> <u>number</u>
<u>3</u>: ‘claims of laborers and other workers engaged in the construction,
reconstruction or repair of buildings, canals and other works, upon said
buildings, canals and other works.’ To the <span style="">extent </span>that claims for unpaid wages fall outside the scope of
Article 2241, number 6 and 2242, number 3, they would come within the ambit of
the category of ordinary preferred credits under Article 2244.'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5. The DBP anchors its claim on a mortgage credit.  A mortgage directly and immediately subjects
the property upon which it is imposed, whoever the possessor may be, to the
fulfillment of the obligation for whose security it was constituted (Article
2176, Civil Code).  It creates a real
right which is enforceable against the whole world.  It is a lien on an identified immovable property, which a
preference is not.  A recorded mortgage
credit is a special preferred credit under Article 2242 (5) of the Civil Code
on classification of credits.  The
preference given by Article 110, when not falling within Article 2241 (6) and
Article 2242 (3) of the Civil Code and not attached to any specific property,
is an ordinary preferred credit although its impact is to move it from second
priority to first priority in the order of preference established by Article
2244 of the Civil Code (Republic v. Peralta, <u>supra</u>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, even if DBP and the private respondents assert their
preferred credits in a judicial proceeding, the former's claim must first be
satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 110 of the Labor Code has been amended <span style="font-size: 11pt;">by </span>R.A. No. 6715 and now reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">"Article 110.  Worker
preference in case of bankruptcy. - In the event of bankruptcy or liquidation <span style="font-size: 11pt;">of </span>an employer's business, his workers shall <span style="font-size: 11pt;">enjoy </span>first preference as regards their unpaid
wages <u>and</u> <u>other</u> <u>monetary</u> <u>claims</u>, any provision of
law to the contrary notwithstanding.  Such <u>unpaid</u> <u>wages</u>, and <u>monetary</u> <u>claims</u> shall
be paid in full <u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>claims</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Government</u>
<u>and</u> <u>other</u> <u>creditors</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>paid</u>."
(Underlining ours.)</p>

<p class="BODY">We ruled in <u>DBP</u> <u>v</u>. <u>NLRC</u>, <u>supra</u>, that
the amendment "expands worker preference to cover not only unpaid wages
but also other monetary claims to which even claims of the Government must be
deemed subordinate." Hence, under the new law, even mortgage credits are
subordinate to workers' claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, respondent NLRC ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Lastly, while we are cognizant of the pronouncement of the
Supreme Court with respect to Art. 110 and while we hold in respect said pronouncements,
we are of the earnest view that considering that art. 110 has been amended by
RA 6715, complainants preference over government claims and other creditors be
adhered to." (Rollo, p. 65)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">R.A. No. 6715, however, took effect only on March 21,1989.  The amendment cannot therefore be
retroactively applied to, nor can it affect, the mortgage credit which was
secured by the petitioner several years prior to its effectivity.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was our pronouncement in <u>DBP</u> <u>v</u>. <u>NLRC</u>, <u>supra</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"6.  Even if Article
110 and its Implementing Rule, as amended, should be interpreted to mean
‘absolute preference,’ the same should be given only prospective effect in line
with the cardinal rule that laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the
contrary is provided (Article 4, Civil Code).  Thereby, any infringement on the constitutional guarantee on
non-impairment of the obligation of contracts (Section 10, Article III, 1987
Constitution) is also avoided.  In <span style="">point </span>of fact, DBP's mortgage credit
antedated by several years the amendatory law, RA No. 6715.  To give Article 110 retroactive effect would
be to wipe out the mortgage in DBP's favor and expose it to a risk which it
sought to protect itself against by requiring a collateral in the form of real
property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The public respondent, therefore, committed grave abuse of
discretion when it retroactively applied the amendment introduced by R.A. No.
6715 to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing discussion, we no longer find it necessary to
discuss the two other issues raised by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.  The assailed decision of public respondent
National Labor Relations Commission dated April 15, 1991 and <span style="">its </span>resolution dated May 17, 1991 are
