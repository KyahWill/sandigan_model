				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In Civil Case No. 6977, the Court of First Instance of Rizal declared the contract, entitled:&nbsp; "Sanglaan ng Isang Lupa na Patuluyan Ipaaari," valid and binding contract of sale and dismissed the complaint as well as the counterclaim with costs against the plaintiff.&nbsp; From said judgment of the lower court, appeal was taken to this Court, "the same involving, as it does, a question of law." (p. 25, <i>Rollo</i>)<br><br>Plaintiff Juan Aguinaldo in his complaint alleged, among others, that on June 23, 1958, defendants, through fraud, deceit and misrepresentations and exercising undue pressure, influence and advantage, procured the thumbmark of Jose Aguinaldo, father of plaintiff, to be affixed on subject contract; that defendants caused the cancellation of Tax Declaration No. 4004, Rizal (1948) in the name of Jose Aguinaldo and the issuance in lieu thereof of Tax Declaration No. 10725-Rizal in the names of defendant spouses; that the document in question on which Jose Aguinaldo affixed his thumbmark is not true and genuine, as the thumbmark appearing thereon is a forgery; that it contains terms and conditions which partake the nature of "pacto comisario" which render same null and void; that it does not fix a period for the payment of the loan nor does it state the duration of the mortgage; that plaintiff is the sole successor-in-interest and legal heir of Jose Aguinaldo who died intestate in October 1960; that defendants having no right to win and possess the property in question are withholding the possession thereof from plaintiff and consequently deprived plaintiff of the fruits of said property; and that by reason of the willful and male­volent acts of defendants, plaintiff suffered moral and actual damages in the amount of P4,000.00.<br><br>In their answer, defendants claim absolute ownership of subject property upon the death of Jose Aguinaldo in October 1960 on the theory that the document in controversy is one of sale and not one of mortgage.<br><br>The parties, through their respective counsels, agreed to submit the case for decision solely on whether the contract in question, Annex "A" of the complaint, is one of mortgage or of sale.<br><br>When plaintiff Juan Aguinaldo died intestate on August 6, 1965, his heirs, namely:&nbsp; Marina and Primitivo, both surnamed Aguinaldo, petitioned the trial court that they be substituted as party plaintiffs in lieu of their deceased father.<br><br>It is the position of plaintiffs-appellants that the document in question, Annex "A" of the complaint, is null and void because it contains stipulations which partake of the nature of "pacto comisario." On the other hand, the defendants contend that the contract is a valid sale and, as such, it passed the title to them.<br><br>Hereunder is the contract in question:<br><blockquote><center>"SANGLAAN NG ISANG LUPA-CANAVERAL NA PATULOYAN IPAAARI</center><br>HAYAG SA SINO MAN MAKAKABASA:<br><br>"Na, ako JOSE AGUINALDO, Pilipino, balo, may karampatan gulang, tubo at naninirahan sa Bo.

In some Tagalog provinces the word "Sangla" means "Bilihan Mabibiling Muli" or "Pacto de Retro".&nbsp; By this contract, the vendee-a-retro takes possession of the property as owner until the same is repurchased or redeemed.&nbsp; On the other hand, mortgage is understood as "Prenda."<br><br>In the case at bar, defendants-appellees took possession of the property on March 26, 1955 when they started giving Jose Aguinaldo the fifty centavos (P0.50) a day.&nbsp; It would appear then that the money which he has been receiving from the Estebans come from his own property.&nbsp; In effect, there was no consideration for the transfer of the property - be it sale, mortgage or Pacto Comisario.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court, dated August 16, 1966, is <b>REVERSED</b> and the contract "Sanglaan ng Isang Lupa-Canaveral na Patuluyan Ipaaari" is declared null and void, and the deceased plaintiff Juan Aguinaldo is declared as the true and lawful owner of subject property.<br><br>Further, defendants-appellees are hereby ordered to transfer and deliver the possession of subject property to the said deceased plaintiff Juan Aguinaldo's heirs, Marina Aguinaldo and Primitivo Aguinaldo, who substituted him as plaintiffs in this case and/or their respective heirs and successors; and the Provincial Assessor of Rizal is directed to cancel Tax Declaration No. 10725 (Rizal) in the name of defendants-appellees, Jose Esteban and Francisca Sarmiento, and in lieu thereof issue another in the name of the deceased plaintiff Juan Aguinaldo's heirs, Marina Aguinaldo and Primitivo Aguinaldo.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, (Chairman), Plana, Gutierrez, Jr., De La Fuente,</i> and <i>Alampay, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Melencio-Herrera, J.,</i> no part.</div>
