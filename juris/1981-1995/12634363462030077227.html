has found the distressed parties coming to court as adversaries in seeking a
definition of their respective rights or liabilities thereunder.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 05 March 1981, petitioner Bank of America, NT &amp; SA,
Manila, received by registered mail an Irrevocable Letter of Credit No.
20272/81 purportedly issued by Bank of Ayudhya, Samyaek Branch, for the account
of General Chemicals, Ltd., of Thailand in the amount of US$2,782,000.00 to
cover the sale of plastic ropes and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>"agricultural
files," with the petitioner as advising bank and private respondent
Inter-Resin Industrial Corporation as beneficiary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 March 1981, Bank of America wrote Inter-Resin informing the
latter of the foregoing and transmitting, along with the bank's communication,
the letter of credit.  Upon receipt of
the letter-advice with the letter of credit, Inter-Resin sent Atty. Emiliano
Tanay to Bank of America to have the letter of credit confirmed.  The bank did not.  Reynaldo Dueñas, bank employee in charge of letters of credit,
however, explained to Atty. Tanay that there was no need for confirmation
because the letter of credit would not have been transmitted if it were not
genuine.</p>

<p class="BODY">Between 26 March to 10 April 1981, Inter-Resin sought to make a
partial availment under the letter of credit by submitting to Bank of America
invoices, covering the shipment of 24,000 bales of polyethylene rope to General
Chemicals valued at US$1,320,600.00, the corresponding packing list, export
declaration and bill of lading.  Finally,
after being satisfied that Inter-Resin's documents conformed with the
conditions expressed in the letter of credit, Bank of America <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">issued in favor of Inter-Resin a Cashier's
Check for P10,219,093.20, "the Peso equivalent of the draft (for) US$1,320,600.00
drawn by Inter-Resin, after deducting the costs for documentary stamps, postage
and mail </span>insurance.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> The
check was picked up by Inter-Resin's Executive Vice-President Barcelina
Tio.  On 10 April 1981, Bank of America
wrote Bank of Ayudhya advising the latter of the availment under the letter of
credit and sought the corresponding reimbursement therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Inter-Resin, through Ms. Tio, presented to Bank of
America the documents for the second availment under the same letter of credit
consisting of a packing list, bill of lading, invoices, export declaration and
bills in set, evidencing the second shipment of goods.  Immediately upon receipt of a telex from
Bank of Ayudhya declaring the letter of credit fraudulent,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> Bank
of America stopped the processing of Inter-Resin's documents and sent a telex
to its branch office in Bangkok, Thailand, requesting assistance in determining
the authenticity of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the letter of
credit.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>Bank of America kept Interresin
informed of the developments.  Sensing a
fraud, Bank of America sought the assistance of the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI).  With the help of
the staff of the Philippine Embassy at Bangkok, as well as the police and
customs personnel of Thailand, the NBI agents, who were sent to Thailand,
discovered that the vans exported by Inter­-Resin did not contain ropes but
plastic strips, wrappers, rags and waste materials.  Here at home, the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> NBI
also investigated Inter-Resin's President Francisco Trajano and Executive Vice
President Barcelina Tio, who, thereafter, were criminally charged for estafa
through falsification of commercial documents.  The case, however, was eventually dismissed by the Rizal Provincial
Fiscal who found no <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence to warrant prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Bank of America sued Inter-Resin
for the recovery of P10,219,093.20, the peso equivalent of the draft for
US$1,320,600.00 on the partial availment of the now disowned letter of
credit.  On the other hand, Inter-Resin
claimed that not only was it entitled to retain P10,219,093.20 on its first
shipment but also to the balance US$1,461,400.00 covering the second shipment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 June 1989, the trial court ruled for Inter-Resin,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
holding that:  (a) Bank of America made
assurances that enticed Inter-Resin to send the merchandise to Thailand; (b)
the telex declaring the letter of credit fraudulent was unverified and
self-serving, hence hearsay, but even assuming that the letter of credit was
fake, "the fault should be borne by the BA which was careless and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">negligent”</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

means of communication to verify with Bank of Ayudhya in Thailand the
authenticity of the letter of credit before sending the same to Inter-Resin;
(c) the loading of plastic <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">products
into the vans were under strict supervision, inspection and verification of
government officers who have in their favor the presumption of regularity in
the performance of official functions; and (d) Bank of America failed to prove
the participation of Inter-Resin or its employees in the alleged fraud as, in fact,
the complaint for estafa through falsification of documents was dismissed by
the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
sustained the trial court; hence, this present recourse by petitioner Bank of
America.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following issues <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">are
raised </span>by Bank of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">America:  (a) whether it has warranted the genuineness
and authenticity of the letter of credit and, corollarily, whether it has acted
merely as an advising bank or as a confirming bank; (b) whether Inter-Resin has
actually shipped the ropes specified by the letter of credit; and, (c)
following the dishonor of the letter of credit by Bank of Ayudhya, whether Bank
of America may recover against Inter-Resin under the draft executed in its
partial availment of the letter of credit.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In rebuttal, Inter-Resin holds that:  (a) Bank of America cannot, on appeal, belatedly raise the issue
of being only an advising bank; (b) the findings of the trial court that the
ropes have actually been shipped is binding on the Court; and, (c) Bank of
America cannot recover from Inter-Resin because the drawer of the letter of
credit is the Bank of Ayudhya and not Inter-Resin.</p>

<p class="BODY">If only to understand how the parties, in the first place, got
themselves into the mess, it may be well to start by recalling how, in its
modern use, a letter of credit is employed in trade transactions.</p>

<p class="BODY">A letter of credit is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a
financial </span>device developed by merchants as a convenient and relatively
safe mode of dealing with sales of goods to satisfy the seemingly
irreconcilable interests of a seller, who refuses to part with his goods before
he is paid, and a buyer, who wants to have control of the goods before paying.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
To break the impasse, the buyer may be required to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"> </span>contract a bank to issue a letter of credit in favor of the
seller so that, by virtue of the letter of credit, the issuing bank can
authorize the seller to draw drafts and engage to pay them upon their
presentment simultaneously with the tender of documents required by the letter
of credit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The buyer and the seller agree on what documents are to be presented for
payment, but ordinarily they are documents of title evidencing or attesting to
the shipment of the goods to the buyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once the credit is established, the seller ships the goods to the
buyer and in the process secures the required shipping documents or documents
of title.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">To </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">get paid, the seller
executes a draft and presents it together with the required documents to the
issuing bank.  The issuing bank redeems
the draft and pays cash to the seller if it finds that the documents submitted
by the seller conform with what the letter of credit requires.  The bank then obtains possession of the </span>documents
upon paying the seller.  The transaction
is completed when the buyer reimburses the issuing bank and acquires the
documents entitling him to the goods.  Under this arrangement, the seller gets paid only if he delivers the
documents of title over the goods, while the buyer acquires the said documents
and control over the goods only after reimbursing the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">What characterizes letters of credit, as distinguished from other
accessory contracts, is the engagement of the issuing bank to pay the seller
once the draft and the required shipping documents are presented to it.  In turn, this arrangement assures the seller
of prompt payment, independent of any breach of the main sales contract.  By this so-called "independence
principle," the bank determines compliance with the letter of credit only
by examining the shipping documents presented; it is precluded from determining
whether the main contract is actually accomplished or not.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

delivers the documents of title and draft to the issuing bank to recover

<p class="BODY">The number of the parties, not infrequently and almost invariably
in international trade practice, may be increased.  Thus, the services of an <u>advising</u> (notifying) bank<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

drawn by the exporter.  Further, instead

to have the draft discounted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being a product of international commerce, the impact of this
commercial instrument transcends national boundaries, and it is thus not
uncommon to find a dearth of national law that can adequately provide for its
governance.  This country is no
exception.  Our own Code of Commerce
basically introduces only its concept under Articles 567-572, inclusive,
thereof.  It is no wonder then why great
reliance has been placed on commercial usage and practice, which, in any case,
can be justified by the universal acceptance of the autonomy of contracts
rule.  The rules were later developed
into what is now known as the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits ("U.C.P.") issued by the International Chamber of Commerce.  It is by no means a complete text by itself,
for, to be sure, there are other principles, which, although part of <u>lex</u>
<u>mercatoria</u>, are not dealt with in the U.C.P.</p>

we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">have said that the observance of the
U.C.P. is justified by Article 2 of the Code of Commerce which expresses that,
in the absence of any particular provision in the Code of Commerce, commercial
transactions shall be governed by usages and customs generally observed.  We have further observed that there being no
specific provisions which govern the legal complexities arising from
transactions involving letters of credit not only between or among banks
themselves but also between banks and the seller or the </span>buyer, as the
case may be, the applicability of the U.C.P. is undeniable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue raised by the petitioner, i.e., that it has in
this instance merely been an advising bank, is outrightly rejected by
Inter-Resin and is thus sought to be discarded for having been raised only on
appeal.  We cannot agree.  The crucial point of dispute in this case is
whether under the "letter of credit," Bank of America has incurred
any liability to the "beneficiary" thereof, an issue that largely is
dependent on the bank's participation in that transaction; as a mere advising
or notifying bank, it would not be liable, but as a confirming bank, had this
been the case, it could be considered as having incurred that liability.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Court said:  Where the issues already
raised also rest on other issues not specifically presented, as long as the
latter issues bear relevance and close relation to the former and as long as
they arise from matters on record, the court has the authority to include them
in its discussion of the controversy and to pass upon them just as well.  In brief, in those cases where questions not
particularly raised by the parties surface as necessary for the complete
adjudication of the rights and obligations of the parties, and such questions
fall within the issues already framed by the parties, the interests of justice
dictate that the court should consider and resolve them.  The rule that only issues or theories raised
in the initial proceedings may be taken up by a party thereto on appeal should
only refer to independent, not concomitant matters, to support or oppose the
cause of action or defense.  The evil
that is sought to be avoided, i.e., surprise to the adverse party, is in
reality not existent on matters that are properly litigated in the lower court
and appear on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot seriously be disputed, looking at this case, that Bank
of America has, in fact, only been an advising, not confirming, bank, and this
much is clearly evident, among other things, by the provisions of the letter of
credit itself, the petitioner bank's letter of advice, its request for payment
of advising fee, and the admission of Inter-Resin that it has paid the
same.  That Bank of America has asked
Inter-Resin to submit documents required by the letter of credit and eventually
has paid the proceeds thereof, did not obviously make it a confirming
bank.  The fact, too, that the draft
required by the letter of credit is to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">drawn
</span>under the account of General Chemicals (buyer) only means that the same
had to be presented to Bank of Ayudhya (issuing bank) for payment.  It may be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">significant to recall that the letter of credit is an engagement of the
issuing bank, not the advising bank, </span>to pay the draft.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No less important is that Bank of America’s letter of 11 March
1981 has expressly stated that "[t]he enclosure is <u>solely</u> <u>an</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">advise</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>of credit opened by the

This written reservation by Bank of America <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">in </span>limiting its obligation only to being an advising bank is in
consonance with the provisions of U.C.P.</p>

<p class="BODY">As an advising or notifying bank, Bank of America did not incur
any obligation more than just notifying Inter-Resin of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">letter of </span>credit issued in its favor,
let alone to confirm the letter of credit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> The
bare statement of the bank employee, aforementioned, in responding to the
inquiry made by Atty. Tanay, Inter-Resin's representative, on the authenticity
of the letter of credit certainly did not have the effect of novating the
letter of credit and Bank of America's letter of advise,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">nor can </span>it justify the
conclusion that the bank must now assume total liability on the letter of
credit.  Indeed, Inter-Resin itself
cannot claim to have been all that free from fault.  As the seller, the issuance of the letter of credit should have
obviously been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>great concern
to it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It would have, in fact, been strange if it did not, prior to the letter of
credit, enter into a contract, or negotiated at the very least, with General
Chemicals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

(describe) the transaction between the bank and the beneficiary as a 'paper

with a necktie and a white shirt at a desk in a bank and by looking at papers
that are presented to him determine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">whether
</span>the bank is obliged to make payment or not.  He is not obligated and, indeed, is foreclosed from donning his
overalls and going into the field to determine whether the underlying contract
has been performed.  This is the
principal reason why careful courts and lawyers state that the letter of credit
is not a guarantee.  In a typical
guarantee the guarantor will agree to make payments if, and only if, the
customer has failed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">fulfill </span>his
obligation on the underlying contract.  If his obligation has been avoided because of the acts of the
beneficiary, typically there would be no obligation to guarantee and thus no
duty on the guarantor to pay.  Letters
of credit are different, and they are explicitly and consciously designed to be
different in this respect.  In effect,
the beneficiary under a letter of credit has bargained for the right to be paid
and thus often to be the defendant instead of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

“The seller of the merchandise is called the Beneficiary of the credit instrument.  The instrument is addressed to him and is in

"Whenever the beneficiary stipulates that the obligation of the opening

operating abroad are only known through the Banker's Almanac.  'They serve a useful purpose in their own

turn out to be (a) x x x bank with which the local bank of the buyer carries a

issued by the opening and confirming banks jointly, thus giving the beneficiary
or a holder for value of drafts drawn under the credit, the right to proceed
against either or both banks, the moment the credit instrument has been
breached.  The confirming bank receives
a commission for its confirmation from the opening bank which the opening bank,

opening bank or on another designated bank not in the city of the seller, any
bank in the city of the seller which buys or discounts the draft of the
beneficiary becomes a Negotiating Bank.  As a rule, whenever the facilities of a notifying bank are used, the
beneficiary is apt to offer his drafts to the notifying bank for negotiation,
thus giving the notifying bank the character of a negotiating bank also.  By negotiating the beneficiary's drafts, the
negotiating bank becomes "an endorser and bona fide holder" of the
drafts and within the protection of the credit instrument.  It is also protected by the drawer's
signature, as the drawer's contingent liability, as drawer, continues until
discharged by the actual payment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of the
bills </span>of exchange" (Shaterian, op, cit., p. 293).</p>

"The banks involved charge a modest commission for their various

See Art. 1878 (9) and (11) of the Civil Code, respectively, provides that a
special power of attorney is required "[T]o bind the principal to render
some service without compensation" and "[T]o obligate the principal
as a guarantor or surety".  Art.
1887 states that "the agent shall act in accordance with the instructions
of the principal". Moreover, Art. 1888 enjoins the agent from carrying out
"an agency if its execution would manifestly result in loss or damage to
the principal."</p>

"Both in the application form for import credits and in the regulations
governing our export credits, it is definitely provided that the banks involved
shall not be responsible for the genuineness of the documents submitted under
commercial credits.  If the buyer of
merchandise has sufficient confidence in the integrity of the seller to provide
payment to the seller against shipping documents to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">be tendered to the bank by </span>the seller, as provided by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">credit instruments, </span>it follows that
the same confidence should extend to the tendering of genuine documents.  If the seller is dishonest, he need not
attempt to defraud the buyer by the tender of forged documents.  He can obtain the desired evil end with less
opportunity for prompt detection by shipping inferior goods or no goods at all.  The carrier does not pry into the cases and
packages to make sure that the merchandise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">is, in </span>fact, as described in the bill of lading and invoices
which are prepared by the shipper.  The
tender of forged documents for the purpose of obtaining money is a crime and
the seller who commits such crime is prosecuted and jailed.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:0in">"x x x Neither can the
interested banks assume responsibility for the character or quality of the
goods shipped nor for the terms of the sale <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">contract not </span>incorporated and made port of the credit
instrument.  How could they?  While the parties to the sale contract may
be experts as to the involved merchandise the banks are not, generally
speaking, sufficiently versed in the fine points of each and every class of
merchandise which they finance.  Even
assuming the bank has men in its employ who can qualify as experts in certain
lines of merchandising, it would not wish to extend this sort of service
without adequate compensation but such service is not a banking function.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:0in">"x x x Because of this the
credit should describe the goods in general terms only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and </span>the buyer should trust that the seller will <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ship </span>the exact merchandise
ordered.  If the buyer is not satisfied
with the moral standing of the seller, he should not open the credit but buy on
open account basis, or subject the draft terms with the additional requirement
that the draft need not be paid until after the buyer has had an opportunity to
examine the goods to make sure that he has received exactly what he
ordered" (Shaterian, op. cit., pp. 352-354).</p>
