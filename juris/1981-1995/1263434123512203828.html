<blockquote>"The complaint alleged, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, that on
September 15, 1911, an agreement to sell Lot 4492 of the Santa Maria Pandi
Friar Land Estate in Angat, Bulacan, with an area of 16,088 square meters was
executed by the Government of the Philippines, repre­sented by the Director of
Lands, in favor of Venancio de la Fuente, as evidenced by Sale Certificate No.
2892.  On December 9, 1929, De la Fuente
assigned all his rights and interests in said Lot 4492 to Felix Tiongson by
Assignment of Sales Certificate No. 2892.  Subsequently, a portion of the lot consisting of 12,570 square meters
was reacquired by the Government which constructed thereon the Marungko Water
Reservoir.  Of the remaining portion <span style="">of </span>said lot consisting of 3,518 square
meters, the Bureau <span style="">of </span>Lands
issued on March 17, 1930 to Felix Tiongson Sales Certificate No. 2892-1.  On December 16, 1942, Tiongson assigned all
his rights and interests over this 3,518 square meter portion to Marcelino
Bongco, who, in turn, assigned the same to Aurelio Santos on September 20,
1946.  On April 26, 1948, the Secretary <span style="">of </span>Agriculture and Natural Resources executed
a Deed <span style="">of </span>Sale over the area of
35 ares, 18 centares, or 3,518 square meters <span style="">of </span>Lot 4492 in favor <span style="">of </span>Aurelio
Santos.  On June 15, 1948, the Bureau <span style="">of </span>Lands transmitted to the Register <span style="">of </span>Deeds of Bulacan the Deed of Sale
for the issuance of the corresponding certificate of title in favor of Aurelio
Santos over the area <span style="">of </span>3,518
square meters and, accordingly, T.C.T. No. T-2743 was issued on June 28, 1948
by the Register of Deeds to Santos over the area in question.  On January 11, 1961, through the Project <span style="">of </span>Partition in Special Proceedings
No. <span style="">1170 of </span>the CFI <span style="">of </span>Bulacan, T.C.T. No. T-2743 of
Aurelio Santos was cancelled and, in lieu thereof, T.C.T. No. T-30791 was
issued to him <span style="">and </span>to his
children (now petitioners).  On November
7, 1972, Aurelio Santos and his children filed with the CFI of Bulacan a
petition entitled ‘In the Matter of the Issuance of Another Transfer
Certificate of Title covering Lot No. 4492, S.M. de Pandi Estate, Bulacan, with
Technical Descriptions in Lieu of <span style="">TCT </span>No.
T-30791 and Correcting Its Area and Civil Status Therefor’ wherein they sought
the cancellation of their TCT No. T-30791 and to order the Register of Deeds of
Bulacan to issue another title 'containing the corresponding technical
description and areas as certified by the Bureau of Lands.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff Republic claimed that Aurelio Santos and his
children acted fraudulently and in bad faith in filing their petition of
November 7, 1972 because they represented to the Court that they were the
owners <span style="">of </span>the whole of Lot <span style="">No. </span>4492 when they knew for a fact
that they owned only 3,518 square meters thereof which was the only portion
sold by the Government to Aurelio Santos; <span style="">that
</span>defendant Aurelio Santos, acting for himself and in behalf <span style="">of </span>the other defendants, presented to the
Court misleading <span style="">facts in </span>their
aforesaid petition by submitting a technical descrip­tion of Lot No. 4492 <span style="">issued </span>by the Bureau of Lands
including a report prepared by one Godofredo R. Villasenor of <span style="">the </span>Land Registration Commission which
stated, among others, that ‘the correct area (of Lot 4492) is 16,088 square
meters as against the erroneous area of 3,518 square meters appearing in
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-30791, Bulacan Registry’; that these
documents were procured without defendant Aurelio Santos <span style="">first </span>informing the Government offices
of the fact that what was assigned or ceded to him was the property described
in Sales Certificate No. 2892-1 covering an area of 3,518 square meters only
and that an area of 12,570 square meters of said Lot 4492 was segregated and
reverted to the Government for the construction of the Marungko Water
Reservoir; that on February 5, 1974, defendant Register of Deeds, acting upon
the order dated January 10, 1974 of the CFI of Bulacan, issued to defendant
Aurelio Santos and his children, TCT No. T-193403 already showing that what was
owned by the registered owners was the whole of Lot No. 4492 with an area of
16,088 square meters instead of 3,518 square meters only, thereby including in
the title the portion covered by the Marungko Water Reservoir; that TCT No.
T-193403 was illegally and erroneously issued and, being null and void, should
be cancelled and the area of 12,570 square meters should be segregated as it
belongs to the Government; and that unless said defendants were restrained from
further occupying and asserting rights of ownership over the area in question,
social unrest would ensue and undermine the Government's effort to maintain
peace and order in the locality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On July 24, 1979, the defendants (now petitioners) moved to
dissolve the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction contending that its
purpose was to regulate the use and appropriation of water accumulated in Lot
4492 and ultimately to settle the water dispute between the parties over said
property; that upon the promul­gation of Presidential Decree No. 1067 (Water
Code) on December 31, 1976, which pertinently provide that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'ART. 88.  The Council shall

context of<span style=""> </span>the provisions of this
Code.'<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>jurisdiction to settle water rights became
vested in the National Water Resources Council; and that therefore, the Court <u>a
quo</u>, having no jurisdiction to settle water rights, could not issue a
preliminary mandatory injunction on the use and appropriation over water
rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 22, 1979, the Solicitor General filed his
opposition to the defendants' motion alleging that a cursory reading of the
complaint revealed that the action was one <span style="">for </span>cancellation of title over <span style="">a </span>portion comprising 12,570 square meters of Lot 4492 which
portion is known as the Marungko Water Reservoir, and the reversion thereof to
the Government; that the purpose of the writ was to allow the Government to
open the two gates and to utilize <span style="">or
repair </span>the existing canals for a free water flow from the
Government-built reservoir which purpose was neither to regulate the use and
appropriation of the waters allegedly accumulated in Lot 4492 nor to ultimately
settle the water dispute between the parties but only to enable the Government
to open the two gates and to utilize or repair the existing canals from the
reservoir; that the case of Abe-Abe, et al. vs. Judge Mante, et al., cited by
defendants finds no application in the instant case which does not involve the
settlement of water rights under the Water Code and Presidential Decree No.
424; and that defendants' motion was a calculated strategy to delay the early
termination and adjudication of the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On December 6, 1979, plaintiff Republic filed a Manifestation
and/or Motion alleging that it had repaired the existing canal's portion
outside Lot No. 4492 going towards the Marungko Reservoir itself, and that it
would undertake the repair of the existing canal's portion inside Lot <span style="">No. </span>4492 held by the defendants; <span style="">that </span>to repair such portions of the
existing canals inside <span style="">the </span>lot,
it sought security from the police addressing a letter-request to the Station
Commander (Integrated National Police) <span style="">of
</span>Angat, Bulacan, and that instead of providing security, the Station
Commander referred the matter to defendants' counsel; and that the Station
Commander should be ordered to obey the writ of preliminary injunction and to
provide the requested security.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On December 17, 1979, the Court <u>a quo</u> issued the

<p class="2Q">"Plaintiff's manifestation and motion regarding enforcement of
the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is also granted.  Therefore, the Station Commander of Angat is
hereby ordered to provide police security when plaintiff or its agents repair
the existing canal inside Lot 4492, and defendants and/or persons acting in
their behalf are hereby ordered to obey the subject writ by allowing plaintiff
to utilize and/or repair the existing canals for a free water flow from the

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

and reversion to the Government of a 12,570 square meters lot covering the
Marungko Water Reservoir alleged to have been illegally and erroneously titled

community caused by the deprivation of the public use and enjoyment of the
waters from the Marungko Reservoir, and to aid the Government </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">maintaining peace and order in the locality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The assignments of error raised by petitioners in this petition
are anchored on two basic arguments, namely:  (1) that the court <u><span style="">a quo</span></u><span style=""> lacks jurisdiction on the ground that the
suit involves water rights properly within the jurisdiction </span>of <span style="">the Water Council created under Presidential
Decree No. </span>1067, <span style="">and (2) the
issuance by the court <u>a quo</u> </span>of <span style="">the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is premature and improper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) has
jurisdiction actions for annulment of title, reversion and damages (Heirs of
Tanak Pangawaran Patiwayan v. Martinez, 142 SCRA 252 [1986]).  The nature <span style="">of </span>an <span style="">action </span>in
court is determined <span style="">by </span>facts
alleged in the complaint (Malayan Industries Corporation v.<span style=""> </span>Judge Mendoza, 154 SCRA 548 [1987];

(Salao v. Crisostomo, 138 SCRA 17 <span style="">[1985]).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the complaint of the Republic is for
cancellation of title <span style="">over </span>a
portion of 12,570 square meters of Lot No. 4492 of the Sta. Maria de Pandi
Estate, known as the Marungko Water Reservoir, and the reversion thereof to
said respondent.  The complaint contains
factual allegations sufficient to support its prayer for the annulment of
petitioners' title to Lot 4492, and for the reversion <span style="">of the portion of </span>said lot covered by the Marungko Water
Reservoir to the Government.  The suit
clearly involves title to, and possession of real property, exclusive original
jurisdiction over which is conferred upon the Regional Trial Courts under
Section 19(2) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Formerly Sec. 44(b), Rep. Act
296.  As such, the court <u>a quo</u>

limited jurisdiction conferred upon the National Water Resource Council over
all disputes relating to appropriation, utilization, exploitation, development,
control, conservation and protection of <u>waters</u> and said jurisdiction of
the council does not extend to, much less cover, conflicting rights over real
properties, jurisdiction over which is vested by law with the regular
courts.  Where the issue involved is not
on a settlement of water rights dispute, but the enjoyment of a right to water
use for which a permit was already granted, the regular court has jurisdiction
over the dispute, not the National Water Resources Council (Amistoso v. Ong,

[1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General took the position which was correctly
sustained by the Court of Appeals that the allegations in the complaint
regarding the appropriation or use of water in the Marungko Water Reservoir
located inside Lot 4492 for which injunctive writ was issued are incidental
matters that have no bearing with the main cause of action which is the assertion
of ownership over the land in question and its reversion to the public domain.</p>

<p class="BODY">As expressly authorized by Section 1, Rule 58 of the Rules of
Court, it is indubitable that a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued at
any time after the commencement of an action and before judgment, when it <span style="">is </span>established that the plaintiff is
entitled to the relief demanded and only when his complaint shows <span style="">facts </span>entitling him to such relief

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it can <span style="">be
gleaned from the questioned order </span>dated August 11, 1978, that <span style="">the trial court gave both parties the
opportunity </span>to be heard as they introduced evidence on the propriety of
the issuance of the injunctive writ.  It
is well-settled that no grave abuse of discretion could be attributed to a
judge or body in the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction where a party
was not deprived of its day in court as it was heard <span style="">and had exhaustively presented all its arguments and defenses (National
</span>Mines and Allied Workers Union (NAMAWEMIF) <span style="">v. </span>Valero, 132 SCRA 578 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Similary, the records show that all the requisites for the proper
issuance of a mandatory injunction such as:  (a) that the invasion of the right is material and substantial; (b) the
right of a complainant is clear and unmistakable; and (c) there is an urgent
and permanent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage (Rivera v.
Florendo, 144 SCRA 643 [1986]), have been fully satisfied in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The government's title to the property in question has been shown
to be clear, well-defined and certain and that there is an urgent need for its
issuance in order to prevent social unrest in the community <span style="">for </span>having been deprived <span style="">of </span>the use and enjoyment of waters
found in the reservoir located in the subject premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, counsel for the petitioners agreed to the grant of the
questioned writ <span style="">of </span>injunction but
later made a complete turnabout impugning the same and claiming that the court
had no jurisdiction over the subject matter.  Unquestionably, petitioners are now estopped to question said issuance
after submitting to the jurisdiction of the court by their expressed conformity
given through their counsel.  Indeed, a
party can not adopt inconsistent positions (Republic v. Court of Appeals, 133
SCRA 505 [1984]).  The doctrine <span style="">of </span>estoppel bars a party from trifling
with the courts (Depositario v. Hervias, 121 SCRA 756 [1983]).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant petition is
hereby DENIED for lack of merit, the assailed order <span style="">of </span>the court <u><span style="">a quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>dated August 11, 1978 is AFFIRMED,
and the instant case is hereby remanded to the lower court for further
proceedings.  Costs against petitioner.</p>
