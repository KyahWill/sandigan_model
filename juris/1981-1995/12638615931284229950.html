				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Is an employee precluded from filing any claim against the
employer after his resignation and the execution of a quitclaim accompanying
the same?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the issue raised in
this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was em<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">p</span>loyed
as a salesman of private respondent on or about <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1982</st1:date>, with a monthly salary of P1,300.00 and
a 3% commission on all of his sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1984</st1:date> he submitted his
letter of resignation and a quitclaim releasing the private respondent from<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> any money claims he may </span>have.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After some time, petitioner filed a complaint
in the Ministry of Labor and Employment against private respondent for
non-payment of commission, sick and vacation leaves and 13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The matter was referred to a labor arbiter
who, after requiring the parties to submit their position papers, rendered a
decision dated March 18, 1986 awarding the petitioner the amount of P35,273.92
for unpaid commissions/overprice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
other claims relating to 13th month pay, vacation and sick leaves and service
incentive leave of petitioner were dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC), wherein in due course a decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1987</st1:date> was rendered reversing the appealed decision
and dismissing the complaint for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the herein petition wherein petitioner urges that he is
not precluded from filing a money claim against the private respondent despite
the resignation letter and quitclaim he executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The general rule is that once an employee
resigns and executes a quitclaim in favor of the employer, he is thereby <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">filing
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">any </span>further money claims
against the employer arising from his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only when the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
of the execution of the quitclaim or release is put into issue or when it is
established that there is an unwritten agreement between the employer and
employee upon resignation entitling the employee to other remuneration or
benefits when such a money claim of the employee may be given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, it is not denied that after the resignation of the
petitioner he nevertheless received three checks from the private respondent
dated <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1984</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1984</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1984</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He was able to <span class="SpellE">encash</span> one (1) check in the amount of
P2,080.00 but the payment of the other two was stopped by private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent admitted that during the employment of
petitioner he was paid a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">salary </span>of
P1,300.00 monthly and he was also entitled to a 3% commission but not to overprice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it denied owing petitioner any
amount as in fact the petitioner executed a quitclaim and release.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent also points out that the
three checks payable to cash were commissions to be given to certain third
parties for the sale of its products.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds no merit in this pretension of private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner had
resigned as early as <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1984</st1:date>,
there was no reason why said three (3) checks would fall into his hands after
he severed connections with private respondent if it were not intended as
payment to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, petitioner <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> one of the checks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only logical conclusion is that there was a parallel agreement
between the parties upon the execution of the quitclaim and release that
private respondent shall pay petitioner the commissions due him for the sales
he made.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, however, is not persuaded that aside from the
commission, the petitioner is entitled to an overprice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the original complaint
filed by petitioner with the Ministry of Labor and Employment shows that he was
only seeking the payment of commissions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no mention of an overprice.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, when petitioner was referred to the labor arbiter he was
made to submit his position paper he claimed not only the commissions but for
the first time the alleged overprice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The private respondent traversed this claim by asserting that only a 3%
commission and not an overprice was allowed petitioner during his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to state that petitioner can not ask for relief not
alleged and prayed for in his complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since he was only claiming his commission, he cannot claim other alleged
amounts due him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>appealed
decision of the labor arbiter petitioner was awarded the total amount of
