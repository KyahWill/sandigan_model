on <i>certiorari</i> seeks to set aside the decision of the then Intermediate
Appellate Court which affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case
mainly on the issue of the applicability of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, the law regulating the rentals of dwelling
units.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In 1965, petitioner
Francisco </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">D. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Palanca</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> leased his apartment unit, located at No.
714-F <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City to private respondent Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Incomio</span> (a market
vendor) at a monthly rental of one hundred and sixty pesos (P160.00).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rental </span>was later increased by
mutual agreement between the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and lessee to
five hundred pesos (P500.00) starting from November 1979.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner demanded from the private respondent the execution
of a written contract of lease as the contract had been merely verbal since
1965.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent, however,
refused to sign any written contract despite the long period of time given
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner therefore terminated
the month-to-month contract of lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
sent a letter of demand dated <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1981</st1:date> to the private respondent asking the latter to vacate the
premises on or before <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="12">December 15, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
private respondent did not leave<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner brought his complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> before the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
authorities but no amicable settlement could be reached.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was certified for filing with the
proper court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1982</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed his complaint against the respondent with the Metropolitan
Trial Court, Branch 28 of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his answer, the respondent alleged that he
was forced by the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to agree
to the increase of rentals to P500.00 in November 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he agreed due to the
petitioner's threat of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further asserted that said increase was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of section 1 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 which prohibits the annual increase of
monthly rentals (not exceeding P300.00) of all residential units by more than
ten per cent (10%) of the monthly rentals existing at the time of the approval
of said Act (i.e., April 10, 1979).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">While the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case was pending before the Metropolitan Trial
Court, respondent <span class="SpellE">Incomio</span> filed a complaint before
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> authorities and later, before the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office for
alleged violation of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal
dismissed the complaint on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">December 23, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> on the ground that the complainant consented
to the increased rental as shown by the consistent payments since 1979 until
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case was filed in 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal stated that a mutual agreement to
increase is not prohibited by law, citing the opinion of the then Ministry of
Justice to which office the fiscal had sent a query on the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The opinion embodied in the Minister's answer
dated </span><st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"While it is true that Sec. 1, PD No. 20 prohibits any
increase in the agreed monthly rental of a dwelling unit rented at P300.00 a
month or less, the injunction is explicitly directed against the unilateral
increase of the rental by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'No <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of a dwelling unit or of land

lessee as of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Act when said

<blockquote>"Where the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the lessee,
however, come to terms and mutually agree on the increase, such agreement is
legal and binding between the parties as this is sanctioned under LOI No. 768,
which contains the implementing rules of PD No. 20, specifically par. 3 (a)
thereof, which states:</blockquote>

amount in a bank for the account of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, complainant's payment of the increased
rental for over a period of two (2) years without objection or protest is
indicative of voluntary acquiescence on his part to the hiked rental thereby
lending credence to respondent's claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that
the aforesaid increase was mutually consented to by the parties and, therefore,
not covered by the proscription of Presidential Decree No. 20." (At p. 33,

<p class="BODY">The Metropolitan Trial Court, after trying the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ejectment</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> case dismissed the petitioner's
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court stated that Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 applies to this
case such that the increase in rentals from P160.00 to P500.00 monthly was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 1 of the same law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the lease, being on a
month-to-month basis as fixed by Article 1687 of the Civil Code, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">was for</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed to the Regional Trial Court Branch 95, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner based his appeal on the
allegation that the decision was contrary to the facts and the applicable
laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent appealed on
the ground that the court failed to adjudge the petitioner as liable for the
damages prayed for in the answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Regional Trial Court reversed the dismissal order of the
Metropolitan Trial Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that the increase in rentals from
P160.00 to P500.00 was valid because a reading of Pres. Decree No. 20 as
amended (cited in the opinion of the Minister of Justice) will show that the
law does not intend to prohibit the raising of rental amounts by mutual consent
of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Citing the opinion of the
Minister of Justice, the court ruled that the law prohibits only a </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">unilateral</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> <u>increase</u> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of the
rentals by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> but not one that is mutually
agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Regional Trial Court further ruled that the verbal contract
of lease on a month-to-month basis was a lease with a <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">definite</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> <u>period</u> </span>and falls under the exception in Section 6, Batas
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the lease may be terminated any month,
after which judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> is allowed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court explained that the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> had the legal right to terminate the verbal contract
of lease at the end of a month when, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">in
</span>this case, the defendant refused to sign a written agreement to renew
the lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent appealed to the respondent Intermediate
Appellate Court which, on <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="3">March 22,
 1985</st1:date>, set aside the Regional Trial Court's decision and reinstated
the Metropolitan Trial Courts order of dismissing the complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for reconsideration was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its decision, the respondent appellate
court dealt only with </span>the limitation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">on </span>the increase of rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It held that the change between Pres. Decree No. 20 and Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 is
"significant" such that in the latter the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">legislature laid </span>down a public policy against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">any mode of increase beyond the prescribed
rate, including one arranged by mutual agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The present petition raises the main issue of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">whether </span>or not an increase in rentals
by mutual agreement of the parties by more than 10% a month is covered by the
prohibition in Section 1, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Additionally, the petition raises the question of whether or not a
contract of lease on a month to month basis is one with a definite period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The private respondent
reiterates in his brief his objection to the petitioner's premise that the
increase was mutually agreed upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
private respondent </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">explains that
he gave his consent only because he was threatened by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
with <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He states that the prohibition in Section 1 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 applies to this case since the </span>in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">crease was imposed by a unilateral act of the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is apparent from the
records that the private respondent consistently paid the increased rents since
November 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For two and a half years
as of the time the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> was filed
in May 1982 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">there </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was no effort on his part to sue the
petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">violation of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Regional Trial Court was correct in finding that the "long period of time
the payment of said rent could not have lasted without the defendant (private
respondent herein) having freely consented to it." There is no
satisfactory proof of the alleged coercion but even assuming that the alleged
threat which pressured him to make payments </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">true, the moment he
was compelled by the petitioner to consent to the increased rentals beyond the
amount fixed by law was the time for him to sue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court can not accord relief to the
private respondent who now claims lamely that his failure </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sue at the earliest time possible was due to
his ignorance of any law that was violated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If he was indeed prejudiced by the increase to which he consented, he
should have immediately </span>sought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">legal
assistance and availed of any remedy available to him or at least, withheld the
payment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the full amount of P500.00 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for some time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The
records show, however, that he let time pass by without manifesting </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">any sign of being aggrieved or showing any
resistance to the arrangement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the petitioner later on demanded that the lease
contract be in written form and assuming the truth of the allegation that the
petitioner wanted a further increase of rental to P1,000.00, still these do not
change the earlier agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For it was only then that the respondent thought of questioning the
validity of the increased rental which was fixed as early as November 1979.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of this, the Court rules that there was consent and
acquiescence on the part of private respondent to the increase of the rentals
by more than <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">10% a month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The acquiescence alone amounts to a voluntary
act of accepting the arrangement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
there was mutual agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Is the mutually agreed increase of rentals from P160.00 to
P500.00 a month covered by the prohibition under Sec. 1, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25?</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues that it is not covered and the said
provision is <u>not</u> applicable because there is nothing in that law which
prohibits a mutual agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner further states that contrary to the conclusion of the respondent
appellate court, i.e., that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
legislature intended to prohibit not only an increase imposed by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> but also one that is mutually agreed, there is in
fact <u>no</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">substantial</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> <u>difference</u> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">between section 1, Pres. Decree No. 20 and
Section 1, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
25 (which amends the former) as both laws proscribe an increase made by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">petitioner stresses </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that both statutes do not explicitly prohibit
an agreement to increase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Section 1 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the above-quoted provision, unlike Section 1 of Pres.
Decree No. 20, fails to specify the person or persons responsible for the
increase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

only to an increase <u>imposed</u> by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> upon

view that the legislature has consistently adopted the same intent in the law
to prevent abuse by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of any provision as to who
initiates the increase does not change the meaning of the law by extending the
prohibition even to cases where the parties have freely agreed to increased
