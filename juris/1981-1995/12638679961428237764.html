<p class="BODY">The petitions of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>
originated from a series of administrative complaints, ten in number, filed
against him by various city officials sometime in 1988, on various charges,
among them, abuse of authority, oppression, grave misconduct, disgraceful and
immoral conduct, intimidation, culpable violation of the Constitution, and
arbitrary detention.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

a clerk assigned to the City Health, Office of Iloilo City charged that due to
political reasons, having supported the rival candidate, Mrs. Rosa O. <span class="SpellE">Caram</span>, the petitioner City Mayor, using as an excuse the
exigency of the service and the interest of the public, pulled her out from
rightful office where her qualifications are best suited and assigned her to a
work that should be the function of a non-career service employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make matters worse, a utility worker in
the office of the Public Services, whose duties are alien to the complainant's
duties and functions, has been detailed to take her place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's act are pure harassments
aimed at luring her away from her permanent position or force her to resign.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ortigoza</span>, she claims that the petitioner handpicked
her to perform tasks not befitting her position as Assistant City Health
Officer of Iloilo City; that her office was padlocked without any explanation
or justification; that her salary was withheld without cause since April 1,
1988; that when she filed her vacation leave, she was given the run-around
treatment in the approval of her leave in connivance with Dr. Rodolfo Villegas
and that she was the object of a well-engineered trumped-up charge in an
administrative complaint filed by Dr. Rodolfo Villegas (Annex B).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Mansuelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Malabor</span> is the duty elected Vice-Mayor of Iloilo City and
complainants Rolando <span class="SpellE">Dabao</span>, Dan <span class="SpellE">Dalido</span>,

Councilor Larry <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, whose key to his office was
unceremoniously and without previous notice, taken by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without an office, Councilor <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> had to hold office at Plaza <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Vice-Mayor and the other complainants
sympathized with him and decided to do the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the petitioner, together with his
fully-armed security men, forcefully drove them away from Plaza <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Councilor <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> denounced the petitioner's actuations the following day
in the radio station and decided to hold office at the Freedom Grandstand at <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>

who gathered to witness the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;

he was allegedly mauled by other detainees thereby causing injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was released only the following day.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The initial hearing in the <span class="SpellE">Cabaluna</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ortigoza</span> cases were set for hearing on <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6">June 20-21, 1988</st1:date> at the Regional Office of the
Department of Local Government in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Notices, through telegrams, were sent to the
parties (Annex L) and the parties received them, including the peti­tioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner asked for a postponement
before the scheduled date of hearing and was represented by counsel, Atty.
Samuel Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing officers,
Atty. Salvador <span class="SpellE">Quebral</span> and Atty. Marino Bermudez had
to come all the way from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> for
the two-day hearings but was actually held only on <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1988</st1:date> in view of the inability and <span class="SpellE">unpreparedness</span> of petitioner's counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The next <span class="SpellE">hearingswere</span> re-set to July 25,
26, 27, 1988 in the same venue - <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the petitioner attempted to delay the
proceedings and moved for a postponement under the excuse that he had just
hired his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the
hearing officers denied the motion to postpone, in view of the fact that the
parties were notified by telegrams of the scheduled hearings (Annex M).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the said hearings, petitioner's counsel cross-examined the
complainants and their witnesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finding probable grounds and reasons, the respondent issued a
preventive suspension order on <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1988</st1:date> to last until <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="10">October
 11, 1988</st1:date> for a period of sixty (60) days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the next investigation was set on <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1988</st1:date> and the petitioner again asked
for a postponement to <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="9">September 26,

and petitioner were present, together with their respective counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner sought for a postponement
which was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these hearings
which were held in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, the
petitioner testified in Adm. Case No. C-10298 and 10299.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The investigation was continued regarding the <span class="SpellE">Malabor</span>
case and the complainants testified including their witnesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On October 10, 1988, petitioner's counsel, Atty. Original moved for
a postponement of the October 24, 1988 hearing to November 7 to 11, 1988 which
was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the motion for
change of venue was denied due to lack of funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1988</st1:date>, the parties and counsel were
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner reiterated his
motion to change venue and moved for postponement anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counsel discussed a proposal to take the
deposition of witnesses in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
so the hearing was indefinitely postponed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the parties failed to come to terms and after the parties were
notified of the hearing, the investigation was set to <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="12">December 13 to 15, 1988</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The petitioner sought for another postponement on the ground that
his witnesses were sick or cannot attend the investigation due to lack of
transportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied
and the petitioner was given up to <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1988</st1:date> to present his evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1988</st1:date>,
petitioner's counsel insisted on his motion for postponement and the hearing
officers gave petitioner up to <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">December
 15, 1988</st1:date> to present his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1988</st1:date>,
the petitioner failed to present evidence and the cases were considered
submitted for resolution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the meantime, a prima facie evidence was found to exist in the
arbitrary detention case filed by <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Erbite</span> so the respondent ordered the petitioner's second
preventive suspension dated <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="10">October
 11, 1988</st1:date> for another sixty (60) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner was able to obtain a
restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction in the Regional Trial
Court, Branch 33 of Iloilo City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second preventive suspension was not enforced.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Amidst the two successive suspensions, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>
instituted an action for prohibition against the respondent Secretary of Local
Government (now, Interior) in the Regional Trial Court, <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where he succeeded in
obtaining a writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Presently, he instituted CA-G.R. SP No. 16417, an action for
prohibition, in the respondent Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1990" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1990</st1:date>,
the respondent Secretary issued another order, preventively suspending Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> for another sixty days, the third time in twenty
months, and designating meantime Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span> <span class="SpellE">Malabor</span> as acting mayor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Undaunted, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> commenced CA-G.R. SP
No. 20736 of the Court of Appeals, a petition for prohibition.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> (<span class="SpellE">Malabor</span>, it is to be noted, is one of the complainants, and
hence, he is interested in seeing Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>
ousted.)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered judgment, dismissing CA-G.R. SP No. 16417.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="5" month="7">July
 5, 1990</st1:date>, it likewise promulgated a decision, dismissing CA-G.R. SP
No. 20736.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1990</st1:date>, it issued a
Resolution certifying the petition of Mary Ann <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>,
who had been similarly charged by the respondent Secretary, to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1990</st1:date>,
we issued a Temporary Restraining Order, barring the respondent Secretary from
implementing the suspension orders, and restraining the enforcement of the
Court of Appeals' two decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our Resolution of <st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1990</st1:date>, we consolidated all three cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our Resolution of <st1:date year="1991" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1991</st1:date>, we gave due course thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> claims as a preliminary
(G.R. No. 93252), that the Department of Local Government in hearing the ten
cases against him, had denied him due process of law and that the respondent
Secretary had been "biased, prejudicial and hostile" towards him<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
arising from his (Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon's</span>) alleged refusal to
join the <span class="SpellE">Laban</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Demokratikong</span> Pilipino party<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and the running political rivalry they maintained in the last congressional and
local elections<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>;
and his alleged refusal to operate a lottery in Iloilo City.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
He also alleges that he requested the Secretary to lift his suspension since it
had come ninety days prior to an election (the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
elections of <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1988</st1:date>),<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
notwithstanding which, the latter proceeded with the hearing--and meted out two
more suspension orders--of the aforementioned cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He likewise contends that he sought to bring the cases to <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> (they were held in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>)
in order to reduce the costs of proceeding, but the Secretary rejected his
request.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
He states that he asked for postponement on "valid and justifiable"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
grounds, among them, that he was suffering from a heart ailment which required
confinement; that his "vital"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
witness was also hospitalized<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
but that the latter unduly denied his request.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon's</span> primary argument (G.R.
Nos. 93252 and 95245) is that the Secretary of Local Government is devoid, in
any event, of any authority to suspend and remove local officials, an argument
reiterated by the petitioner Mary Ann Rivera <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>
(G.R. No. 93746).</p>

<p class="BODY">As to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon's</span> charges of denial
of due process, the records do not show very clearly in what manner the Mayor
might have been deprived of his rights by the respondent Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claims that he and Secretary Luis Santos
were (are) political rivals and that his "persecution" was
politically motivated are pure speculation and although the latter does not
appear to have denied these contentions (as he, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>,
claims), we can not take his word for it the way we would have under less
political circumstances, considering furthermore that "political
feud" has often been a good excuse in contesting complaints.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Mayor has failed furthermore to substantiate his say-so's
that Secretary Santos had attempted to seduce him to join the administration
party and to operate a lottery in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, although the Secretary failed to rebut
his allegations, we can not accept them at face value, much more, as judicial
admissions as he would have us accept them,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a> for the same reasons above-stated
and furthermore, because his say-so's were never corroborated by independent
testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a responsible public
official, Secretary Santos, in pursuing an official function, is presumed to be
performing his duties regularly and in the absence of contrary evidence, no ill
motive can be ascribed to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon's</span> contention that he
had requested the respondent Secretary to defer the hearing on account of the
ninety-day ban prescribed by Section 62 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
337, the Court finds the question to be moot and academic since we have in fact
restrained the Secretary from further hearing the complaints against the
petitioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to his requests, finally, for postponements, the Court is
afraid that he has not given any compelling reason<br>
why we should overturn the Court of Appeals, which found no convincing reason
to overrule Secretary Santos in denying his requests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, postponements are a matter of
discretion on the part of the hearing officer, and based on Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon's</span> above story, we are not convinced that the
Secretary has been guilty of a grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court can not say, under these circumstances, that Secretary
Santos' actuations deprived Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> of due
process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We come to the core question:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not the Secretary of Local Government, as the President's
alter ego, can suspend and/or remove local officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the petitioners' argument that the 1987 Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a>
no longer allows the President, as the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions did, to
exercise the power of suspension and/or removal over local officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to both petitioners, the
Constitution is meant, first, to strengthen self-rule by local government units
and second, by deleting the phrase "as may be provided by law,"<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
to strip the President of the power of control over local governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a view, so they contend, that finds
support in the debates of the Constitutional Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision in question reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall exercise general supervision over local governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provinces with respect to component cities

<p class="BODY">It modifies a counterpart provision appearing in the 1935
Constitution, which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>Sec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President shall have control of all the
executive departments, bureaus, or offices, exercise general supervision over
all local governments as may be provided by law, and take care that the laws be
faithfully executed.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners submit that the deletion (of "as may be
provided by law") is significant, as their argument goes, since:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the power of the President is
"provided by law" and (2) hence, no law may provide for it any
longer.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that in meting out the suspensions under
question; the Secretary of Local Government acted in consonance is with the
specific legal provisions of Batas <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337, the
Local Government Code, we quote:</p>

<blockquote>Sec.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>62. Notice of Hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Within
seven days after the complaint is filed, the Minister of Local Government, or
the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span> concerned, as the case may be, shall
require the respondent to submit his verified answer within seven days from
receipt of said complaint, and commence the hearing and investigation of the
case within ten days after receipt of such answer of the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No investigation shall be held within ninety
days immediately prior to an election, and no preventive suspension shall be
imposed within the said period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
preventive suspension has been imposed prior to the aforesaid period, the
preventive suspension shall be lifted.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>63.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preventive Suspension. ?
(1) Preventive suspension may be imposed by the Minister of Local Government if
the respondent is a provincial or city official, by the provincial governor if
the respondent is an elective municipal official, or by the city or municipal
mayor if the respondent is an elective <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
official.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Preventive
suspension may be imposed at any time after the issues are joined, when there
is reasonable ground to believe that the respondent has committed the act or
acts complained of, when the evidence of culpability is strong, when the
gravity of the offense so warrants, or when the continuance in office of the
respondent could influence the witnesses or pose a threat to the safety and
integrity of the records and other evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In all cases, preventive suspension shall not extend beyond sixty days
after the start of said suspension.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) At the
expiration of sixty days, the suspended official shall be deemed reinstated in
office without prejudice to the continuation of the proceedings against him
until its termination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the
delay in the proceedings of the case is due to his fault, neglect or request,
the time of the delay shall not be counted in computing the time of suspension.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue, as the Court understands it, consists of three
questions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Did the 1987 Constitution,
in deleting the phrase "as may be provided by law" intend to divest
the President of the power to investigate, suspend, discipline, and/or remove
local officials?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) Has the
Constitution repealed Sections 62 and 63 of the Local Government Code?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(3) What is the significance of the change in
the constitutional language?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the considered opinion of the Court that notwithstanding
the change in the constitutional language, the Charter did not intend to divest
the legislature of its right--or the President of her prerogative as conferred
by existing legislation-to provide administrative sanctions against local
officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our opinion that the
omission (of "as may be provided by law") signifies nothing more than
to underscore local governments' autonomy from Congress and to break Congress'
"control" over local government affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution did not, however, intend,
for the sake of local autonomy, to deprive the legislature of all authority
over municipal corporations, in particular, concerning discipline.</p>

<p class="BODY">Autonomy does not, after all, contemplate making mini-states out
of local government units, as in the federal governments of the United States of
America (or Brazil or Germany), although Jefferson is said to have compared
municipal corporations euphemistically to "small republics".<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a>
Autonomy, in the constitutional sense, is subject to the guiding star, though
not control, of the legislature, albeit the legislative responsibility under
the Constitution--and as the "supervision clause" itself suggests--is
to wean local government units from overdependence on the central government.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that under the Charter, "local
autonomy" is not instantly self-executing, but subject to, among other
things, the passage of a local government code,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a> a local tax law,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a>
income distribution legislation,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a> and a national representation law,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a>
and measures<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a>
designed to realize autonomy at the local level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also noteworthy that in spite of
autonomy, the Constitution places the local governments under the general
supervision of the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
noteworthy finally, that the Charter allows Congress to include in the local
government code provisions for removal of local officials, which suggests that
Congress may exercise removal powers, and as the existing Local Government Code
has done, delegate its exercise to the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>Sec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Congress shall enact a local government
code which shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government
structure instituted through a system of decentralization with effective
mechanisms of recall, initiative, and referendum, allocate among the different
local government units their powers, responsibilities and resources, and
provide for the qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term,
salaries, powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all other
matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As hereinabove indicated, the deletion of "as may be
provided by law" was meant to stress, sub <span class="SpellE">silencio</span>,
the objective of the framers to strengthen local autonomy by severing
congressional control of its affairs, as observed by the Court of Appeals, like
the power of local legislation.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a> The Constitution did nothing more,
however, and insofar as existing legislation authorizes the President (through
the Secretary of Local Government) to proceed against local officials
administratively, the Constitution contains no prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are under the impression that the Constitution
has left the President mere supervisory powers, which supposedly excludes the
power of investigation, and denied her control, which allegedly embraces
disciplinary authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a mistaken
impression because legally, "supervision" is not incompatible with
disciplinary authority as this Court has held,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">34</span></span></a> thus:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is true that in the case of <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Silvosa</span>, 51 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>.,
No. 6, p. 2884, this Court had occasion to discuss the scope and extent of the
power of supervision by the President over local government officials in
contrast to the power of control given to him over executive officials of our
government wherein it was emphasized that the two terms, control and
supervision, are two different things which differ one from the other in
meaning and extent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in that case
the Court made the following digression:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In administration law supervision means overseeing or the power or
authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their
duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the latter fail or neglect to
fulfill them the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to
make them perform their duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Control,
on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify
or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his
duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the
latter." But from this pronouncement it cannot be reasonably inferred that
the power of supervision of the President over local government officials does
not include the power of investigation when in his opinion the good of the
public service so requires, as postulated in Section 64(c) of the Revised
Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Control" has been defined as "the power of an
officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer
had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the
former for test of the latter.”<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36</span></span></a> "Supervision" on the
other hand means "overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to
see that subordinate officers perform their duties."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a>
As we held,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a>
however, "investigating" is not inconsistent with
"overseeing", although it is a lesser power than "altering".</p>

<p class="BODY">The impression is apparently exacerbated by the Court's
pronouncements in at least three cases, <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> v.
Roque.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></span></a> <st1:city><st1:place>Hebron</st1:place></st1:city>
v. Reyes,<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span> v. Silvosa,<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">41</span></span></a>
and possibly, a fourth one, <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> v. Auditor
General.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">42</span></span></a>
In <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, this Court said that the President enjoyed
no control powers but only supervision "as may be provided by law,"<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">43</span></span></a> a
rule we reiterated in <st1:city><st1:place>Hebron</st1:place></st1:city>, and <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, we stated that the President "may not ...
suspend an elective official of a regular municipality or take any disciplinary
action against him, except on appeal from a decision of the corresponding
provincial board."<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">44</span></span></a> However, neither <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> nor <st1:city><st1:place>Hebron</st1:place></st1:city>
nor <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span> categorically banned the Chief Executive
from exercising acts of disciplinary authority because she did not exercise
control powers, but because no law allowed her to exercise disciplinary
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, according to <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>:</p>

<blockquote>The contention that the President has inherent power to remove or
suspend municipal officers is without doubt not well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Removal and suspension of public officers are
always controlled by the particular law applicable and its proper construction
subject to constitutional limitations.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">45</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <st1:city><st1:place>Hebron</st1:place></st1:city>, we stated:</p>

<blockquote>Accordingly, when the procedure for the suspension of an officer is
specified by law, the same must be deemed mandatory and adhered to strictly, in
the absence of express or clear provision to the contrary--which does not exist
with respect to municipal officers...<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">46</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span>, the Court held:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
Congress has expressly and specifically lodged the provincial supervision over
municipal officials in the provincial governor who is authorized to
"receive and investigate complaints made under oath against municipal
officers for neglect of duty, oppression, corruption or other form of
maladministration of office, and conviction by final judgment of any crime
involving moral turpitude." And if the charges are serious, "he shall
submit written charges touching the matter to the provincial board, furnishing
a copy of such charges to the accused either personally or by registered mail,
and he may in such case suspend the officer (not being the municipal treasurer)
pending action by the board, if in his opinion the charge by one affecting the
official integrity of the officer in question." Section 86 of the Revised
Administration Code adds nothing to the power of supervision to be exercised by
the Department Head over the administration of *** municipalities ***.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it be construed that it does and such
additional power is the same authority as that vested in the Department Head by
section 79(c) of the Revised Administrative Code, then such additional power
must be deemed to have been abrogated by section ]10(1), Article VII, of the
Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">47</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, we stated that the President

the provincial board pursuant to the Administrative Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">48</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in those cases that this Court denied the President the
power (to suspend/remove) it was not because we did not think that the
President can not exercise it on account of his limited power, but because the
law lodged the power elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in
those cases in which the law gave him the power, the Court, as in <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span>, found little

<p class="BODY">The Court does not believe that the petitioners can rightfully
point to the debates of the Constitutional Commission to defeat the President's

<p class="BODY">The Court is consequently reluctant to say that the new
Constitution has repealed the Local Government Code, Batas <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.

and "removal" are not incompatible terms and one may stand with the
other notwithstanding the stronger expression of local autonomy under the new

is still in force and effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">52</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As the Constitution itself declares, local autonomy means "a
more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a
system of decentraliza­tion."<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">53</span></span></a> The Constitution, as we observed,
does nothing more than to break up the monopoly of the national government over
the affairs of local governments and as put by political adherents, to
"liberate the local governments from the imperialism of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>."
Autonomy, however, is not meant to end the relation of partnership and
interdependence between the central administration and local government units,
or otherwise, to usher in a regime of federalism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Charter has not taken such a radical
step. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Local governments, under the
Constitution, are subject to regulation, however limited, and for no other
purpose than precisely, albeit paradoxically, to enhance self-government.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we observed in one case,<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">54</span></span></a> decentralization means devolution
of national administration--but not power--to the local levels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>Now, autonomy is either decentralization of administration or
decentralization of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
decentralization of administration when the central government delegates
administrative powers to political subdivisions in order to broaden the base of
government power and in the process to make local governments "more
responsive and accountable," and "ensure their fullest development as
self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the pursuit
of national development and social progress." At the same time, it
relieves the central government of the burden of managing local affairs and
enables it to concentrate on national concerns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The President exercises "general supervision" over them, but
only to "ensure that local affairs are administered according to
law." He has no control over their acts in the sense that he can
substitute their judgments with his own.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Decentralization of power, on the other hand, involves an
abdication of political power in the favor of local governments units declared
to be autonomous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the
autonomous government is free to chart its own destiny and shape its future
with minimum intervention from central authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to a constitutional author,
decentralization of power amounts to "self-immolation" since in that
event, the autonomous government becomes accountable not to the central
authorities but to its constituency.<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">55</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The successive sixty-day suspensions imposed on Mayor Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> is albeit another matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What bothers the Court, and what indeed looms
very large, is the fact that since the Mayor is facing ten administrative
charges, the Mayor is in fact facing the possibility of 600 days of suspension,
in the event that all ten cases yield prima facie findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is not of course tolerating
misfeasance in public office (assuming that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>
is guilty of misfeasance), but it is certainly another question to make him
serve 600 days of suspension, which is effectively, to suspend him out of
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we held:<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">56</span></span></a></p>

inflicted likewise on the people of <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were deprived of the services of the man

that sense, to paraphrase Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, the
protracted continuance of this preventive suspension had outrun the bounds of
reason and resulted in sheer oppression.<span style="">&nbsp;

which is to say that it need not be exactly sixty days long if a shorter period
is otherwise sufficient, and which is also to say that it ought to be lifted if
prosecutors have achieved their purpose in a shorter span.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suspension is not a penalty and is not unlike preventive
imprisonment in which the accused is held to insure his presence at the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases, the accused (the
respondent) enjoys a presumption of innocence unless and until found guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suspension finally is temporary, and as the Local Government Code
provides, it may be imposed for no more than sixty days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we held,<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">63</span></span></a> a longer suspension is unjust and
unreasonable, and we might add, nothing less than tyranny.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we observed earlier, imposing 600 days of suspension--which is
not a remote possibility--on Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> is to all
intents and purposes, to make him spend the rest of his term in
inactivity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also to make, to all
intents and purposes, his suspension permanent.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also, in fact, to mete out punishment in spite of the fact
that the Mayor's guilt has not been proven.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, any absolution will be for naught because needless to say, the
length of his suspension would have, by the time he is reinstated, wiped out
his tenure considerably.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not to be mistaken for obstructing the efforts of
the respondent Secretary to see that justice is done in Iloilo City, yet it is
hardly any argument to inflict on Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>
successive suspensions when apparently, the respondent Secretary has had
sufficient time to gather the necessary evidence to build a case against the
Mayor--without suspending him a day longer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is intriguing is that the respondent Secretary has been cracking
down, so to speak, on the Mayor piecemeal--apparently, to pin him down ten
times the pain, when he, the respondent Secretary, could have pursued a
consolidated effort.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reiterate that we are not precluding the President, through
the Secretary of Interior from exercising a legal power, yet we are of the
opinion that the Secretary of Interior is exercising that power oppressively,
and needless to say, with a grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is aware that only the third suspension is under
question, and that any talk of future suspensions is in fact premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains, however, that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> has been made to serve a total of 120 days of
suspension and the possibility of sixty days more is arguably around the corner
(which amounts to a violation of the Local Government Code)--which brings to
light a pattern of suspensions intended to suspend the Mayor the rest of his
natural tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is simply
foreclosing what appears to us as a concerted effort of the State to perpetuate
an arbitrary act.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we said, we can not tolerate such a state of affairs.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are therefore allowing Mayor Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>
to suffer the duration of his third suspension and lifting, for the purpose,
the Temporary Restraining Order earlier issued. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Insofar as the seven remaining charges are
concerned, we are urging the Department of Local Government, upon the finality
of this Decision, to undertake steps to expedite the same, subject to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ganzon's</span> usual remedies of appeal, judicial or administrative,
or <i>certiorari,</i> if warranted, and meanwhile, we are precluding the
Secretary from meting out further suspensions based on those remaining
complaints, notwithstanding findings of prima facie evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resume, the Court is laying down the following rules:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The change in constitutional language (with
respect to the supervision clause) was meant but to deny legislative control
over local governments; it did not exempt the latter from legislative
regulation provided regulation is consistent with the fundamental premise of
autonomy;</p>

therein, impose disciplinary action against local officials;</p>
