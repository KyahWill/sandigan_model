denying his second claim for reimburse­ment of medical expenses incurred in
relation with his heart ailment.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1969</st1:date>,
petitioner suffered a heart attack that incapacitated him from further
performing his function as municipal judge, and which forced him on <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1969</st1:date> to retire from the
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he filed a claim
for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended and was
awarded on <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1970</st1:date>
permanent and total disability benefits and reimbursement of medical expenses
incurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 26, 1975 or after a period of almost six (.6) years
from his initial heart attack on July 26, 1969, petitioner suffered his second
heart attack which proved more severe, causing loss of his power of speech and
the weakening of his body.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 26, 1975, he filed with the Workmen's Compensation Unit
of the Department of Labor, Regional Office No, 5, at San Pablo City, a claim
for reimburse­ment of medical expenses incurred in connection with his
aforesaid second heart attack; but the same was denied on October 14, 1975 by
the acting chief of unit for lack of merit, reasoning that petitioner had been
awarded benefits under Section 15 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended, for permanent and total disability, plus reimbursement of medical
expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner duly filed his motion for reconsideration, invoking
Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent Commission rendered a decision affirming the decision of its acting
chief of unit, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that claimant of this case has previously been
awarded compen­sation under Section 15 of the Act and the instant case was
subsequently filed in relation thereto only for the sole purpose of seeking
reimbursement under Section 13.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We cannot sustain claimant's view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant has already been declared
totally disabled in the previous award.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That being so, no claim for reimbursement of subsequent and further
medical expenses may be entertained or awarded, in accordance with the policy
of this Commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this recourse.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The parties are agreed that the sole issue in this case is
whether or not petitioner is entitled to recover subsequent and further medical
expenses for the same permanent and total disability which had already been the
subject of a maximum compensation benefits under Section 15 of the Workmen's <span style="">Compensation </span>Act, as amended, and for
reimbursement of medical <span style="">expenses
already then incurred under Section </span>13 thereof.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">issue as </span>framed
admits the causal relation­ship of petitioner's 1969 heart attack to his 1975
heart attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
respondent employer did not allege and there was no evidence presented that
petitioner had fully recovered from his <u>first</u> heart, attack in 1969 when
his <u>second</u> <span style="">heart attack occurred
in </span>1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner's
attending physician testified that once the patient has been subjected to this
kind of disease, and there <span style="">is already
exclusion in </span>the blood because of the previous thrombosis, the patient
will be in serious condition because the area <span style="">in </span>the brain will be involved (TSN, September 26, 1975, pp.
17-18, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The members of </span>this
Tribunal are aware of death induced by a second heart attack even after the
lapse of many years from the first attack.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, petitioner's second attack, being causally linked
with his first heart attack which was already declared compensable by the
Workmen's Compensation Commission, may be the source of a claim for further
compensation benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the recent
case of Enriquez versus Workmen's Compensation Com­mission (93 SCRA 366 [1979]),
WE stated that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the right to compensation extends to disability due to disease supervening upon
and proximately and naturally resulting from a compensable injury (82 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 132).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the
primary injury is shown to have arisen in the course of employment, every
natural consequence that flows from the injury likewise arises out of the
employment, unless it is, the result of an independent intervening cause
attributable to claimant's own negligence or misconduct (I Larson Workmen's
Compensation Law 3-279 [1972]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Simply </span>stated, all the medical
consequences and <span class="SpellE">sequelae</span> that flow from the primary
injury are compensable (ibid.)."</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's case therefore comes within the ambit of the 1980
precedents-setting decision of the Supreme Court <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u> in <span class="SpellE">Biscarra</span> vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission (G.R. No.
L-43425, January 22, 1980), where IT sustained the right of an ailing employee
under Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, to continuous
medical treatment and therefore reimbursement for subsequent medical expenses
incurred even after he is declared permanently disabled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>, passing upon
the same issue and arguments <span class="GramE">raised</span> in this present
case, compassionately ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"The Law applicable is Section 13 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended on June 20, 1964, which provides, in part:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'SEC. 13.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Services, appliances and supplies</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Immediately after an employee has suffered
an injury or contracted sickness and during the subsequent period of
disability, <u><span style="">the employer or </span>insurance
carrier shall provide the employee with such services, appliances and supplies
as the nature of his disability and the process of his recovery may require;
and that which <span class="GramE">will<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>promote</span> his early restoration to the maximum level of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his physical capacity</u>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'The word "services" used herein shall include medical,
surgical, dental, hospital and nursing attendance and treatment as well as the
proper fitting and training in the use of appliances and the necessary training
for purposes of rehabilitation; "appliances" shall include crutches,
arti­ficial members and other devices of the same kind, and the replacements or
repairs of such artificial members or such devices unless the replacement or
repair is made necessary by the lack of proper care by the employee; and
"supplies" shall include medicines, as well as medical, surgical and
dental supplies.’ <span class="GramE">(Underlined portions are amendments
introduced by Section 7 of Republic Act 4119 of June 20, 1964).</span></p>

<blockquote>"As will be seen from this law, it imposes upon the employer
the obligation 'to provide the employee with such services, appliances and
supplies as the nature of his disability and the process of his recovery may
require; and that which will promote his early restoration to the maximum level
of his physical capacity.' This law does not provide a maximum either as to the
amount to be paid or the time within which such rights may be availed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain therefore, the proposition that
petitioner's disability being total and permanent, respondent's liability to
furnish him with further medical and hospital expenses is terminated, would, in
effect, qualify Section 13, <u>supra</u>, by adding what is not provided in the
law or subtracting what is therein embodied which is legally
impermissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would constitute
'judicial fiat'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, therefore,
shall limit itself to the clear intendment of the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before the 1964 amendment, but as amended by Republic Act 772
on <st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1952</st1:date>, Section
13 reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'Sec. 13.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Medical attendance.? <span class="GramE">Immediately</span> after an
employee has suffered an injury or contracted sickness and during the
subsequent period of disability, the employer shall provide the employee with
such medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies as the nature of the
injury or sickness may require.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The pecuniary liability of the employer for the necessary medical,
surgical, and hospital services and supplies shall be limited to the amount
ordinarily paid in the community for such treatment of an injured person of the
same standard of living if the treatment had to be paid for by the injured
person him­self.'<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under the above-quoted 1952 amendment - prior to the 1964
amendment - WE already ruled that the employer's liability for medical services
subsists during the period of disability or 'lasts as long as the employee is
sick.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, on <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="10">October
 19, 1961</st1:date>, WE ruled in La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca-Pambusco</span>
<span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Isip</span>,
et al. (L-16495, Oct. 19, 1961 3 SCRA 242, 244):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'We are inclined to uphold this contention of respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, in the order of the
Commission dated <st1:date year="1955" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1955</st1:date>
acting favorably on the claim of respondent it was expressly stated that
petitioner should provide him "<u>further</u> medical, surgical and
hospital services and supplies as the nature of his sickness may require <u>until
it is cured or arrested</u>." Said order became final for lack of protest
or appeal on the part of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then we have the document signed by respondent entitled
"satisfaction of Award or Decision", dated February 7, 1956, which
embodies the so-called compromise agreement entered into between them, and from
this document we find that while respondent received the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,302.05</span> in full satisfaction of the award, the same is
qualified by the following condition: "except with respect<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to further hospital or medical treatment,
whenever necessary." Finally, we have the provisions of Section 13 of Act
No. 3428, as amended (Workmen's Compensation Act), which postulate, among
others, that "during the <u><span style="">sub</span>s</u><u><span style="">e</span>quent p</u><u><span style="">eriod of disability</span></u><span style=""> </span>the
employer shall provide the employee with such medical, surgical and hospital
services and supplies as the nature of the injury or sickness may
require." These provisions justify the subsequent award made by the
Commission.</p>

<p class="2Q">'It is true that under the Workmen's Compensation <span style="">Act </span>the amount of compensation to <span style="">which </span>an injured employee is entitled
in case of disability shall not in any case exceed the total sum of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, but this limitation only applies to the
compensation for disability, and not to medical attendance (Sections 12, 14,
16, 18, Act No. 3428, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, this subject is governed by a different section of law (Section 13, <span class="GramE"><u>Idem</u></span>.)' <span class="GramE">[<span style="">3 </span>SCRA 242, 244; under­scoring supplied].</span></p>

no longer in its employ and that its liability for medical care cannot extend
beyond 208 weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no merit in

require employer-employee relationship as a condition for the employer's

<p class="2Q">'It may be observed that the law, in imposing on the employer the
obligation to provide medical attendance to an injured or sick employee, unlike
those provisions relating to compensation for disability (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
14, 16, 17 and 18 of Act No. 3428, as amended) does not provide maximum either
in the amount to be paid or the time period within which such right may be

concept of disability are invariably limited in both amount and duration while
payments of medical benefits that is, hospital and medical expenses occasioned

states such benefits are unlimited as to duration and amount</u>; in nineteen,
the preliminary limits are subject <span style="">to
extension by the administrative agency for indefinite periods as the case
warrants; in eight, there are fixed limits subject to extension for limited
additional periods; and in nine, there are fixed limits with no provision for

income benefit which is fixed or computed on the basis of the average weekly
wages of the claimant; never to medical benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is likewise pervasive in the law that
the legislature has intended a separate and different treatment for medical
benefits as shown by the fact that it provided for separate provisions for
medical benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the intention of
the lawmakers were to put a limit to medical benefits then they would have
merged or <span class="GramE">lumped</span> the two benefits in all the

payments which is designed to compensate the worker for the loss of wages due
to disability sustained or for his death; and (2) medical benefits in the form
of medical services, hospitalization, medicine and other matters related to the
treatment of the compensable injury or disease (Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Quiason</span>, Labor Standards and Welfare Legislation, 597-598

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'[1-37] </span><span class="GramE">This</span> is a novel and exceptional case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances caution is required
in the construction of the particular statute so as not to <span style="">extend it or </span>affect its general
application to the thousands of other cases not presenting such unusual
features.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In construing paragraph (a) of
Section 8, since the <u>curing of Nee is admittedly impossible</u>, two
principal questions con­front us, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, whether the services rendered or to be
rendered are reasonably necessary to relieve the employee from the effects of
his injury; and, secondly, if such services are necessary, whether power is
conferred upon this court to say when such services shall be terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference to the record clearly shows that
Nee is beyond hope of cure from medical skill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It further shows that the medical, surgical, and hospital services he
had been and is now receiving are not only necessary but also adequate to
relieve him, as far as possible, from the effects of his injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of the Industrial Com­mission on
this phase of the question are unquestionably in accord with the manifest
weight of the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are there­fore
left solely with the question whether, by a construction of paragraph (a) of
Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, this court can say, not only in
this case but in other cases of exceptional nature hereafter presented, that
the medical, surgical and hospital services rendered by an employer where no
cure is possible, may with justice both to the employer and the injured
employee, be terminated after a reasonable length of time, to be determined
according to the varying circumstances of each particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, can it be said that the last
phrase of paragraph (a) should be interpreted to mean that when an employer has
done that which is reasonably required to cure an injured employee from the
effects of his injury and medical advice indicates that a cure is hope­less,
the employer is thereafter relieved from any further liability, under the act,
to furnish medical, surgical, <span style="">and </span>hospital
services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot adopt any such
literal or strained construction of para­graph <span style="">(a) as </span>plaintiff in error urges in this <span style="">case, </span>to the effect that the words "cure" and
"relieve" mean virtually the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A workman who is cured is, <span style="">of </span><span style="">course, </span>relieved from the effects of his injury, but one who is
incurable, as <span style="">in </span>the present
case, may still need skillful attention to relieve him of pain or other
injurious effects caused by his injury.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is only the natural and usual meaning of the words used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a construction in accordance with the
general spirit and humane purpose of the act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Workmen's Compensation Act is a humane law of a remedial nature, and
wherever construction is permissible <span style="">its

<p class="2Q">'[47] By these successive amendments it may be seen that the
legislature deemed inadequate the original limitation of eight weeks' time and
$200 in amount as to medicine and hospital services, as the amendment of 1919
enlarged the hospital services from two weeks to extend "during the period
for which compensation may be payable," and also removed any financial limit,
except as to medical or surgical services.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The amendment in 1925 went further by removing all time or money
limitation upon medical and surgical services, and limited medical, surgical,
and hospital services to such as might be "reasonably required to cure or
relieve from the effects of the injury." In the absence of express
statutory authority this court is therefore powerless to place a definite
limitation upon the time such medical, surgical and hospital services shall be
rendered in any particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
have said before, the proof here shows that medical and hospital services are
necessary to relieve Nee from the effects of his injury and that such services
cannot be rendered in his home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no proof indicating any malingering or feigned sickness in this case, or any
other circumstance which <span style="">would enable
us to say that further services are not </span>reasonably necessary to relieve
Nee from the effects of his injury.</p>

<p class="2Q">'As the Legislature has seen fit to amend paragraph <span style="">(a) </span>of section 8 and to successively
omit the former limitations therein imposed upon the furnishing of medical,
surgical and hospital services, it would be nothing short of judicial
legislation for this court now, in an exceptional case, to impose such a
limitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The limitations of the
section in question cannot be definitely fixed except by the Legislature, <span style="">and the only reasonable interpretation which
we are able to </span>place upon it, <span style="">as
</span>said above, is that the employer's liability continues so long as
medical, surgical, and hospital services are required in order to relieve the
injured employee from the effects of his injury.'</p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, to follow the modern trend of medical care, the
direction is for increased medical liability to be the 'third phase of
medicine', from 'preventive medicine' and 'definitive or curative medicine or
surgery', to the dynamic concept of 'medical rehabilitation', one principal
objective of which is to reduce or alleviate the disability to the greatest
possible degree (Injury and Death under Workmen's Compensation Law, Samuel B. <span class="SpellE">Horovitz</span>, p. 297; Medical Hand­book on Workmen's

alleviation of the humiliating effects of his injury, like plastic surgery
after the first operation that may leave an ugly scar or deformity; (3) to be
provided with <span style="">such facilities, supplies
or equipment </span>that will restore the normal use of his senses, faculties,
or limbs, such as improved models of wheelchairs, crutches, artificial limbs or
hearing or visual aids; and (4) to rehabilitation of his morale and spirit by
eliminating the psychological effects of the trauma caused by the ailment or
injury so that he can join, and be accepted by, the mainstream of society and
lead a normal life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the disability benefits have been paid, the disabled
employee may remain to be the main support of his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Denial to him of further hospital, medical or

fancied than real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, no
statistics have been cited to show that there <span class="GramE">are many
permanently disabled and needing continued medical treatment</span> or
hospitali­zation for a long period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the employer can always secure or purchase insurance against
such possible liability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, the govern­ment is the employer against
whom such liability for continued hospitalization, medical services and medical
supplies, <span style="">is </span>being raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government can always appropriate the
necessary funds for the purpose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The government has been losing revenues, either through graft
and corruption or failure to honestly and fully collect such revenues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">These amounts of which the
government has been mulcted by dishonest public officers, private contractors,
or suppliers or which the government failed to collect by reason of the
criminal neglect or dishonesty of its collecting agencies, may aggregate
hundreds of millions, if not billions, of pesos yearly.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">financial
exposure of the government to provide medical and hospital services for its
unfortunate employees rendered permanently disabled but still suffering pain or
humiliation or degradation by reason of such permanent disability is
practically minimal, or not substantial, compared to the millions of pesos that
the country is losing all these years through graft and corruption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government has failed not only to
prosecute many big-time tax dodgers, grafters and corruptors but also to
recover even a portion of the unpaid revenues or the amounts embezzled or
stolen from its coffers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until the
guilty parties are brought before the courts, the tribunals cannot do
anything."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this case of
petitioner who served the govern­ment </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">municipal judge from
1947 to 1969, risking his health and life, and who prays for a second
reimbursement of his medical expenses, "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> this Court has the singular opportunity to afford him
relief from his misery and not let him deteriorate until his body </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">finally and totally decomposed and dissolved into dust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any gratuity that he might have received,
aside from the first compensation for wage loss and the first refund for
hospitalization and medical treatment, would not even be sufficient to maintain
his family for the remaining few years of his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his retirement gratuity and disability
compensation already exhausted by now (after eleven years from 1969), he and
his family are exposed to complete misery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The government or the court that does not lift a hand to rescue the
ailing employee and his family from such abject penury cannot rightly claim to
be an agency of social justice, much less pretend to be compassionate."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the Court <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>
by way of emphasizing ITS role as a potent social justice arm of the State
concluded optimistically in the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Biscarra</span>
case that --</p>

<blockquote>"WE may yet escape the judgment of history that the Supreme
Tribunal was once found wanting in 'moral vision' and abdicated ITS role as an
active implementing instrument of reform.’ "</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that
petitioners claim for medical reimbursement as stated in his letter to the <span class="SpellE">Workmens</span> Compensation Unit was for the amount of P20,588.85

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MELENCIO-HERRERA, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner herein was appointed Municipal Judge in 1947.  He suffered his first heart attack in July,
1969.  He retired from the service in
October, 1969 and was awarded, in October 1970, by the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, permanent and total disabi­lity benefits and reimbursement of
medical expenses incurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">After approximately six years from the date of his retirement, or
in 1975, petitioner suffered a second heart attack.  He incurred further medical expenses consisting of
hospitalization and physician's fees in the amount of P19, 880.00.  Respondent Commission denied his claim for
further reimbursement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The question is, should
petitioner be entitled to reimbursement for the subsequent medical and
hospitalization expenses that he had incurred?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although under the ruling of the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in
Biscarra vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission (95 SCRA 248 [1980] ),
petitioner is so entitled, I am constrained, as a matter of principle, to
reiterate my dissent in that case to the effect that under the Workmen's Compen­sation
Act, a totally and permanently disabled claimant is not entitled, up to his
death, to continued hospital, medical and surgical services, nor to further
reimbursement of his medical expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Briefly, the reasons I stated were:  1) under section 13 of the said Act, an employee is entitled to
such services and expenses "immediately x x x during the subsequent period
of disability", or, to immediate medical expenses.  2) Under sections 22 and 29 of the Act,
"the employer shall be exempt from all liability under this Act as soon as
the compensation has been paid under this section, saving the provisions of
section six of this Act." 3) Throughout the said Act; the legislative
intent to limit payable compensation to P6,000.00 is evident (see secs. 12, 14,
16, 18).  4) The administrative inter­pretation
given by the Workmen's Compensation Commission to section 13 of the Act,
although never conclusive, is usually given great weight by the Courts as it is
the department charged with the implementation of the Workmen's Compensation
Act (Madrigal &amp; Paterno vs. Rafferty &amp; Concepcion, 38 Phil. 415 [1918];
Asturias Sugar Central vs. Com­missioner of Customs, 1 SCRA 617 [1961] ).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Relative to the assertion
that the Philippines is a "welfare state" </span><span style="">(p. 26, majority Decision) to which </span><span style="">I </span><span style="">also took exception in my previous dissent in Biscarra and which I
reiterate herein, I need mention only the statement of President Marcos, quoted
in the local Times Journal of April 27, 1980, reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Speaking during a breakfast hosted by the Hawaii Chamber of
Commerce and Industry at the Oahu Country Club in <span style="">Honolulu, </span>the President further pledged not to adopt the welfare
state policy.  This could render
industry bankrupt, he said, stressing that his policy is for a proportionate
sharing of wealth between capital and labor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I, therefore, vote for
the affirmance of the ruling of the Work­men's Compensation Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and WCC</u> (95 SCRA 248, 282) that "an employee who has been declared to
be totally and permanently disabled and who has received the maximum P6,000. - disability
compensation therefor and has been reimbursed the medical expenses attendant to
the injury or illness which rendered him so incapacitated is not entitled under
the Act and more particularly under section 13 to any further payment or reim­bursement
for subsequent medical expenses.  The
Act has never bur­dened the employer, be it the government itself, (and this
has always been the official construction and implementation of the Act as
hereto­fore stated) with the obligation of making unlimited payments <span style="">for </span>sub­sequent medical services and
expenses for as long as the permanently and totally disabled employee
lives.  Not even in the case of the
State as employer has such a limitless burden been imposed, for the cost
thereof would be staggering, if not altogether prohibitive, not to men­tion
that no provision for such an open-ended and endless obligation has ever been
provided in the budget for the half-century that the Work­men's Compensation
Act has been in force.  The employer's
obligation ceases upon payment of the maximum and fixed P6, 000. -disability
com­pensation for total and permanent disability and the medical expenses
attendant thereto (which generally have amounted to about the same sum fixed as
maximum compensation);" and that "the remedy for the plight of the
permanently disabled who were not taken care of by the old Workmen's
Compensation Act lies not with the Court but with the lawmakers.  This they can give by simple remedial
legislation provid­ing the necessary funds and directing that the medical and
rehabilita­tion services contemplated and provided for under the above-cited Ar­ticles
185 and 190 of the New Labor Code are made applicable and shall be available to
the employees and workers who incurred permanent and total disability under the
Workmen's Compensation Act."</p>

<p class="BODY">I reiterate that in our deliberations, the majority decision in <u>Biscarra</u>
"was expressly <u>limited</u> to the <u>government as the employer</u> and
that the question of whether the same ruling of now holding the government as
employer liable for indefinite lifelong medical, surgi­cal and hospital
expenses of totally and permanently <span style="">disabled
employees </span>would also apply to the <u>private</u> employers, many of
which could pos­sibly be thrown into bankruptcy should this ruling be also
applied to them (considering the prevailing high costs of such medical
expenses), was left <u>open</u> and <u>unresolved</u>." (Emphasis copied)</p>

<p class="BODY">Confronted, however, with the majority ruling in <u>Biscarra</u>
holding <span style="">that </span>the government as
employer (as in the case at bar) con­tinues to be liable for the indefinite,
lifelong medical, surgical and hospital expenses of totally and permanently
disabled employees, (not­withstanding their having been paid the corresponding
disability com­pensation and reimbursed the medical expenses attendant to their
dis­abling injury or illness), we have to apply the prevailing rule, for as
long as the same has not been overturned and set aside.  (Cf. Yap vs. Republic, 45 SCRA 36, 40
[1972]).  Accordingly, I am constrained
to concur in the result.</p>
