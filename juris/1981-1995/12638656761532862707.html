				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, the petitioner seeks to set
aside the decision of the then Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of
Appeals, promulgated on March 25, 1986 in AC-G.R. CV No. 69824, affirming with
modification the decision of the former Court of First Instance of Manila dated
February 4, 1981, against the herein petitioner, Universal Shipping Lines,
Inc., the defendant in the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about March 22, 1974, SEVALCO, Limited, owned and operated
by the petitioner, shipped from Rotterdam, Netherlands, to Bangkok, Thailand,
aboard its M/V "TAIWAN", two (2) cargoes of 50 palletized cartons
consisting of 2,000 units of 25-kilogram bags of <span class="SpellE">Statex</span>
R Brand carton black, with a declared gross weight of 53,000 kilos each.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were respectively consigned to S. <span class="SpellE">Lersen</span> Company, Ltd. and <span class="SpellE">Muang</span> <span class="SpellE">Ngarm</span> Retreads, Ltd., per Bills of Lading Nos. RB-15 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) and RB-16 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both shipments were insured with the private
respondent, Alliance Assurance Company, Ltd., a foreign insurance company
domiciled in London, England, which had withdrawn from the Philippine market on
June 30, 1951 yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the arrival of the vessel on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1974</st1:date> at <st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city>,
the cargo covered by Bill of Lading No. RB-15 was <span class="GramE">not
unloaded nor</span> delivered to the consignee, S. <span class="SpellE">Lersen</span>
Company, Ltd.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
shipment under Bill of Lading No.</span> RB-16 was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Muang</span> <span class="SpellE">Ngarm</span> Retreads, Ltd. with a
total weight shortage of 11,070 kilos because the cargoes had been either
totally or partially dissolved in saltwater which flooded Hatch No. 2 of the
vessel where they had been stored.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arrival in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1974</st1:date>, Arturo C. <span class="SpellE">Saavedra</span>, master of M/V "<st1:country-region><st1:place>TAIWAN</st1:place></st1:country-region>,"
filed a marine protest (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H), pertinent portions
of which read:</p>

definitely ascertained where it comes from.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Muang</span> <span class="SpellE">Ngarm</span> Retreads, Inc.,
filed their respective formal claims for loss and damage to their cargoes on <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1974</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.

The insurer paid both claims in the amounts of L12<span class="GramE">,180</span>
and L2,547.18 for the loss and damage to their cargoes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1976</st1:date>,
private respondent, as insurer-<span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>, filed an
action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover from the petitioner
and its <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> agent, Carlos Go Thong &amp; Company,
what it paid the consignees of the cargo.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered judgment for
the private respondent, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered ordering
defendants Universal Shipping Lines, Inc. and Carlos Go Thong &amp; Co.,
jointly and severally, to pay plaintiff Alliance Assurance Co., Ltd., under the
first cause of action, the sum of L12,180.00 or the peso equivalent thereof,
and under the second cause of action, the sum of L2,547.18 or the peso
equivalent thereof, both with legal interest thereon from June 25, 1976, the
date of the filing of the present action, until said obligations are fully
paid, plus attorney's fees in the sum of P10,000.00, with costs." <span class="GramE">(pp. 24-25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the decision was affirmed
after exculpating petitioner's ship-agents in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
(Go Thong) from any liability on the ground that it had no participation in the
shipment of the cargo which had been loaded and discharged in places other than
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, petitioner alleges that
respondent court erred:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in holding petitioner
liable for the damage/loss suffered by the subject shipments;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in holding that private
respondent has capacity to sue in this jurisdiction;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in finding that private
respondent's cause of action has not yet prescribed; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in awarding attorney's
fees without stating any factual, legal and equitable justification.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is not meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error raises a factual issue which we
decline to review as this Court may review only legal issues which must be distinctly
set forth in the petition (Sec. 2, Rule 45, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of
Court). In any event, the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in
holding, as the trial court did, that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x

was incumbent upon the defendants to prove that the losses and damages were due
to causes other than the negligence or fault of their employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said defendants have not adduced proof on
this point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

while the shipments were in the custody of the M/V ‘Taiwan’ the liability of
its owner/operator and shipping agent is clear -- they must pay for the losses
and damages sustained by the consignees as a consequence of the breach of
contract of water transportation." <span class="GramE">(pp. 27-28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of jurisdiction, we uphold the appellate court's
ruling that the private respondent may sue in Philippine courts upon the marine
insurance policies issued by it abroad to cover international-bound cargoes
shipped by a Philippine carrier, even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">if
</span>it has no license to do business in this country, for it is not the lack
of the prescribed license (to do business in the Philippines) but doing
business without such license, which bars a foreign corporation from access to
our courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Pacific Vegetable Oil
Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Singzon</span>, L-7919, April 29, 1955; <span class="SpellE">Eastboard</span> Navigation, Ltd. vs. J. <span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span>

the defendant's rejection of the private respondent's demand, compelled the
latter to litigate and incur expenses to protect and enforce its just and valid
claim.</p>
