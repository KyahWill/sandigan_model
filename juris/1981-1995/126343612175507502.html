with the then Court of First Instance, now Regional Trial Court, of Negros
Oriental, Engracio Valeriano, Juanito Rismundo, Macario Acabal, Abundio Nahid
and several John Does were charged with the crimes of Murder and Frustrated
Murder.  The accusatory portion in the

docketed as Criminal Case No. 4585, reads as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"That sometime in the evening of the 28th of January, 1980, at
Nagbinlod, Municipality of Sta. Catalina, Province of Negros Oriental,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, including several 'John Does', conspiring and
confederating with one another, with intent to kill, and with treachery and
evident premeditation and being then armed with bolos and 'pinuti', did then
and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use
personal violence on the person of one Rizalina Apatan Silvano while the latter
was about to leave her house and inflicting upon her injuries, to wit:  'right leg amputated below the knee; left
leg hacked behind the knee; abdomen hacked with viscerae evacerated,' and did
then and there set the house on fire while the aforementioned Rizalina Apatan
Silvano was inside said house trying to escape therefrom, and allowing her to
be burned inside said house which was burned to the ground, thereby causing
upon said Rizalina Apatan Silvano her death and burning her beyond recognition.</p>

<p class="2Q">That the crime was committed with attendant aggravating
circumstances of nighttime, by a band, by means of fire, craft [,] fraud or
disguise employed; and that means have been employed which brought added
ignominy to the natural effects of their acts.</p>

<p class="2Q">Contrary to Article 248 in relation to Article 14 of the Revised
Penal Code."</p>

<p class="BODY">The information for frustrated murder,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
docketed as Criminal Case No. 4584, alleged that in the evening of the 28th of
January 1980 -- immediately after the commission of the murder charged in
Criminal Case No. 4585 -- the accused hacked and struck Wilson Silvano, son of
the victim in the murder case, with bladed weapons such as bolos and <i>pinuti </i>thereby
inficting upon him multiple hack wounds which would have produced the crime of
murder were it not for the timely and able medical assistance given<b> </b>to
him.  It further alleged that the crime
was committed <span style="">with
the qualifying circumstance of alevosia or treachery and the aggravating
circumstances of nighttime, by a band, with the aid of armed men or persons who
insure or afford impunity, and that craft, fraud or disguise were employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment, all the accused, except the John Does who
remained unidentified and at large, pleaded not guilty in both cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Trial on the merits was conducted by Branch 37 of the court <i>a
quo</i> presided over by Judge Temistocles B. Diez.  But on 16 May 1987, a fire gutted the building where Branch 37
was located and the records of these two cases were burned.  The records were subsequently reconstituted
upon petition of the prosecuting fiscal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> The
testimonies of the witnesses were retaken, however, before it could commence,
accused Engracio Valeriano jumped bail and the warrant for his arrest issued on
16 November 1987 was returned unserved because he could not be found.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
An alias warrant for his arrest was issued on 26 June 1989,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> but
he remains at large up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution, as disclosed by the testimonies
of its witnesses, is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio Silvano, then the barangay captain of Barangay Nagbinlud,
Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental, testified that at about 8:30 o'clock in the
evening of 28 January 1980, or two nights before the 30 January 1980 local
election, three men entered his yard.  He recognized these men as Juanito Rismundo, his neighbor since 1964,
Engracio Valeriano, also another neighbor, and Macario Acabal, his sub-barangay
captain.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The three men called him, but he did not answer.  Instead, his wife, Rizalina, did and she told them that he was
attending a meeting "in the town." They did not believe her and
replied that they just saw Antonio enter the house.  Juanito asked her whether they (Antonio and Rizalina) were
selling their votes because they will buy them but Rizalina answered in the
negative.  Juanito then said, "You
choose, if you want something to happen to you or not [sic]." Another man,
Abundio Nahid, asked Antonio to come down because they have something to tell
him.  As Antonio was about to kick the
door open, he saw the men outside his house increasing in number and were armed
with bladed weapons (<i>pinuti)</i>.  When he turned around, Antonio smelled gasoline and he saw Abundio Nahid
set fire to his store located at the right side of his house.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He and his wife Rizalina escaped to the roof of the kitchen while the other
members of their family who were in that house -- their son Elmer Silvano and
eldest daughter Celsita <span style="">Legaspina with her two children -- escaped towards the </span>sugarcane
field which was about thirty meters away.  When Rizalina fell from the roof to the floor, Macario Acabal, Juanito
Rismundo and Engracio Valeriano hacked her.  Each of them <span style="">delivered </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">single blow with Abundio Nahid
hitting her four </span><span style="">times.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Antonio Silvano admitted that, as barangay
captain of Nagbinlud, Sta. Catalina, and as trusted man of Mrs. Clotilde
Carballo in whose land his house is built, he supported the latter as the
official candidate of the KBL for Mayor of Sta. Catalina, as well as the other
candidates of her party for the local election of 30 January 1980, including
Lorenzo Teves, the KBL's candidate for Governor of the Province of Negros
Oriental.  On the other hand, the
accused supported and campaigned hard for Mrs. Carballo's opponent, a certain
Jose Napigkit who was a candidate of the <i>Pusyon Bisaya</i> and who
eventually won in the election.  In his
barrio, Mrs. Carballo lost heavily to Napigkit.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> He
further admitted that although he first reported the incident to the Philippine
Constabulary (PC) which investigated him, he cannot remember if he was made to
sign anything by the PC investigator.  On 15 February 1980, he was again investigated but this time in the
office of Governor Teves.  There, he was
made to subscribe and swear to an <span style="">affidavit</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that, as admitted by the prosecuting <span style="">fiscal, </span>was made the basis for the
filing of the information.  No statement
by the PC was presented to the <span style="">fiscal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Visitacion Silvano, wife of Wilson who is the son of Antonio and
Rizalina, testified that she heard the shouts for help of her mother-in-law<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
so she woke up Wilson.  He then went
down the house and turned on the headlights of the truck parked in front of
their house facing his parents' house which was located three kilometers
away.  He ran towards the burning house
of his parents but before he reached it, he was met by Engracio Valeriano and
the latter hacked him.  When he ran
away, Engracio's companions, Juanito Rismundo, Macario Acabal and Abundio
Nahid, chased him until he reached the sugarcane fields.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Visitacion stayed in her house and saw Engracio Valeriano hack her
husband.  She also saw the other
accused-appellants in the vicinity of the house of <span style="">her parents-in-law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Avelino Torres, Chief of Hospital of Bayawan District
Hospital, examined the body of Rizalina Silvano at 1:00 o'clock in the early
morning of 29 January 1980 and was presented as a witness for the
prosecution.  According to him, the body
was burned and charred beyond recognition but the parts thereof were still
intact.  It was still warm and smelt of
freshly burned flesh.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> He

also examined Wilson Silvano at about 1:30 o'clock <span style="">that same morning and found seven hack wounds on Wilson.  He testified at the trial that without
medical </span><span style="">attention, </span><span style="">Wilson could have bled to death.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Castulo Caballes, then the Clerk of Court of the Court of
First Instance of Negros Oriental, stated <span style="">in
</span>court that on 7 February 1980, he was fetched from his house by someone
from the office of Governor Lorenzo Teves and was asked to assist the Governor
in taking the affidavit of Juanito Rismundo.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
After the latter "admitted that that was <span style="">his </span>affidavit," he "subscribed to him the oath and so
[he] signed as a notary public."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> In

burning of their houses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also on 7 February 1980, according to Atty. Elson Bustamante,
then Assistant <span style="">Provincial </span>Attorney,
he was called by Governor Teves to assist in the taking of the statements also
of Juanito Rismundo.  The Governor
himself propounded the questions to Juanito who was accompanied by the son of
Mrs. Carballo and a PC soldier named Lodove.  Bustamante heard Mrs. Carballo's son tell the Governor that Juanito went
to their (Carballos’) house and "confessed" to a certain incident
which happened in Sta. <span style="">Catalina on </span><span style="">28
January 1980, and since there were PC soldiers </span><span style="">still assigned to </span><span style="">the Carballos' residence at that
time, they </span><span style="">brought Juanito to </span><span style="">Governor Teves, the Provincial Chairman of the </span><span style="">KBL.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another </span>prosecution
witness, Jufelinito Pareja, then Provincial Fiscal of Negros Oriental, told the
court that on 18 <span style="">February 1980, </span>accused
Macario Acabal was brought to his office.  <span style="">Acabal subscribed </span>and
swore to a statement before him.  The l<span style="">atter first read it to </span>Acabal and
after ascertaining that Acabal voluntarily executed the statement, he
administered the oath to <span style="">said affiant.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">This sworn statement also implicated
Jose Napigkit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants put up the defense of alibi.  They allege <span style="">that they were in different places when </span>the incident in question
<span style="">occurred.  Macario </span>Acabal was in sitio Canggabok, Nagbinlud, Sta.
Catalina, attending the wake for deceased barangay captain Filomeno Cumahig.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
On 29 January 1980, he was arrested by military men in the house of his aunt at
the breakwater of Poblacion Sta. Catalina.  One of them struck him three times on his <span style="">left and right </span>chest with an armalite rifle.  Thereafter, he <span style="">was loaded into a </span>pick-up truck owned by Mrs. Clotilde Carballo <span style="">and taken </span>to <span style="">her house.  </span>On <span style="">7 </span>February 1980, he was brought <span style="">to Bayawan and </span>was again manhandled,
causing injuries to him which <span style="">required
treatment at </span>the Bayawan <span style="">District
Hospital, as </span>certified by Dr. Torres.  From the hospital, he was brought to the municipal jail of Bayawan and
then to the Provincial Jail in <span style="">Dumaguete City.  Later, he was taken to the office of the Governor and was forced
to </span><span style="">sign
</span><span style="">an </span><span style="">affidavit
(Exhibit "F").  Prior to 28
January 1989, he did not know the other accused </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

On 6 February 1980, he met a PC soldier named Boy Gudobe (Lodove), who was then
stationed in Bgy. Kawitan, Sta. Catalina, accompanied by Diosdado Silvano,
grandson of Antonio Silvano, at the Sta. Catalina market.  Gudobe allegedly hit him and, together with
Diosdado and a Boy Carballo, the son of Mrs. Clotilde Carballo, brought him to
the Capitol Building in Dumaguete City.  While there, he averred that he was forced by a lawyer to sign an
affidavit (Exhibit "D") in the office of the Governor after he was
struck with the handle of a revolver at the back of his head.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Abundio Nahid was in his house in Sugong Milagros, Sta. Catalina,
Negros Oriental, about 20 kilometers from Nagbinlud.  He charged that Wilson Silvano testified against him because the
Silvanos supported Mrs. Carballo of the KBL while he led the supporters of Mrs.
Carballo's opponent <span style="">Jose </span>Napigkit
of the <i><span style="">Pusyon

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented on rebuttal Mrs. Clotilde Carballo and
Fiscal Wilfredo Salmin.  The former
testified that on 7 February 1980 accused Juanita Rismundo voluntarily surrendered
to her at her residence in Sta. Catalina and told her that he wanted to see the
Governor.  She then asked her son to
bring Juanita to Dumaguete City.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fiscal Wilfredo Salmin belied the claim of Acabal that he
(Salmin) went to the Provincial Jail on 10 February 1980 and forced Acabal to
sign a document.  He alleged that on 16
February 1980, not on 10 February 1980 as claimed by Acabal, Acabal came to his
office at the Provincial Attorney’s Office and executed a sworn statement, but
Acabal did not sign the same upon the advice of Atty. Geminiano Eleccion.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the trial court, per Judge Pacifico S. Bulado, dated 31 October 1991 but

of nighttime, use of fire by burning the house of victim Rizalina
Apatan-Silvano in order to forcibly drive her out of her house and hack her to
death, the abuse of superior strength, the penalty impossable [sic] here will

Temporal to Reclusion Perpetua, and for all the accused to indemnify the heirs
of the victim the sum of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos since this case
occured [sic] in 1980.  For the wounding
of the victim Wilson A. Silvano, this Court believes that simple frustrated
homicide only is committed by the accused Engracio Valeriano only.  But since the person who actually inflicted
the injuries of victim Wilson Silvano, accused Engracio Valeriano only is
nowhere to be found, hence, not brought to the bar of justice, he being a
fugitive or at large, no penalty could be imposed on him since he is beyond the

impossible for them to go to the scene of the crime and to return to the place

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assigned error, they claim that:  (a) the trial court could not have ordered
the cancellation of their bail bonds and their arrest and immediate confinement
because the only penalty it imposed on them was "to indemnify the heirs of
the victim the sum of thirty thousand (P30,000.00) pesos" without imposing
any sentence; it merely suggested that "x x x the penalty impossable [sic]
here will be in its maximum degree, that <span style="">is
</span><i>reclusion perpetua</i> <span style="">x x </span>x";
and (b) since they already perfected their appeal immediately after the
promulgation of the sentence, the trial court lost jurisdiction over the case
and could not validly cancel their bail bonds and order their arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Brief,<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a> the
Appellee asserts that the judgment appealed from is valid and enforceable.  Although the word <span style="">"impossable" [sic] is
"imprecise,</span>"<span style=""> it is clear that what the </span>judge actually meant was that
the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> was what the law allowed or mandated
him to impose.  As to the grant of bail,
since they committed a capital offense and the court had already found that the
evidence of their guilt is strong, the accused-appellants should not be
entitled to bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the decision substantially complies with the Rules
of Court on judgments as it did sentence the accused-appellants to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i>.  A judgment of conviction
shall state (a) the legal qualification of the offense constituted by the acts
committed by the accused, and the aggravating or mitigating circumstances
attending the commission, if there are any; (b) the participation of the
accused in the commission of the offense, whether as principal, accomplice or
accessory after the fact; (c) the penalty imposed upon the accused; and (d) the
civil liability or damages caused by the wrongful act to be recovered from the
accused by the offended party, if there is any, unless the enforcement of the
civil liability by a separate action has been reserved or waived.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
As we earlier observed, the challenged decision does not contain the usual
dispositive portion.  The last two
paragraphs of the decision merely embody its conclusions that:  (1) the appellants are guilty of murder, and
(2) taking into account the "attendant qualifying aggravating
circumstances of nighttime, use of fire by burning the house of the victim, x x
x the abuse of superior strength," "the penalty imposable x x x will
be in its maximum degree, that is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>” considering that,
"the penalty now for murder is <i>reclusion temporal</i> to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i>.” While the decision leaves much to be desired, it nevertheless
contains the court's <span style="">findings </span>of facts, the law applicable to the set of facts
and what it believes to be the imposable penalty under the law, that <span style="">is, </span><i>reclusion
perpetua</i> which is actually the penalty imposed on the
accused-appellants.  It is obvious that
they clearly understood that they were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the crime of murder and were sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> in Criminal Case No. 4585.  Were it otherwise, they would not have declared in open court their
intention to appeal immediately after the promulgation of the decision and
would not have subsequently filed their written notice of appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants contend that the trial court did not impose
any sentence and so cannot cancel anymore their bail bonds and direct their
arrest and immediate commitment because it already lost jurisdiction over their
persons when they perfected their appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with Section 3, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of
Court on bail, we ruled in <i>People vs. Cortez</i><a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"<span style="">x x x </span>an
accused who is charged with a capital offense or an offense punishable by <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>perpetua</u>, and is thereafter convicted of the offense
charged, shall no longer be entitled to bail as a matter of right even if he
appeals the case to this Court since his conviction clearly imports that the
evidence of his guilt of the offense charged is strong."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We have already said that the decision
did impose the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.  Since the order cancelling their bail bonds and directing their
arrest is contained <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>decision</u> <u>itself</u>,
it is apparent that their abovementioned contention is highly illogical.  At the time the order in question was made,
the trial court still had jurisdiction over the persons of the
accused-appellants.  For too obvious
reasons, their notices of appeal which they claim have put an end to the trial
court's jurisdiction over them could not have been filed before the
promulgation of the decision.  The order
is therefore valid and enforceable.  Also, it may be recalled that the accused-appellants had earlier raised
this issue before us in a petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> dated 16 January
1992 and docketed as G.R. Nos. 103602-03.  We dismissed that petition on 17 Febru<span style="">a</span>ry 1992 for failure to comply with requirement no. (2) of
Revised Circular <span style="">No. 1-88 and Circular No. 28-91 on forum shopping.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Their
motion for reconsideration was denied on 27 May 1993.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, however, erred in considering nighttime, use of
fire and abuse of superior strength as "attendant qualifying aggravating
circumstances." The information in Criminal Case No. 4585 alleged only
treachery and evident premeditation as qualifying aggravating
circumstances.  Nighttime, band, use of
fire, craft, fraud or disguise and ignominy were alleged as generic aggravating
circumstances only.  The trial court
cannot elevate the status of any of the generic aggravating circumstances and
consider them as qualifying circumstances for the crime of murder.  Moreover, nighttime is <span style="">not a
qualifying circumstance under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was likewise an error for the trial court to state that
"the penalty now for murder is <i>reclusion temporal</i> to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i>.” The penalty for murder remains to be <i>reclusion temporal
maximum</i> to death.  But in view of
paragraph (1), Section 19, Article III of the Constitution prohibiting the
imposition of the penalty of death, where death would have been the proper
penalty in a case, the court must instead impose the penalty of <i>reclusion
perpetua.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court further erred in holding that no penalty could be
imposed on accused Engracio Valeriano in Criminal Case No. 4584 because he
"is nowhere to be found, hence, not brought to the bar of justice, he
being a fugitive or at large." The court ignored the fact that Engracio
jumped bail after he had been arraigned, just before the retaking of evidence
commenced.  Paragraph (2), Section 14,
Article III of the Constitution permits trial <i>in absentia</i> after the
accused has been arraigned provided he has been duly notified of the trial and
his failure to appear thereat is unjustified.  One who jumps bail can never offer a justifiable reason for his
non-appearance during the trial.  Accordingly, after the trial <i>in absentia</i>, the court can render
judgment in the case<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a> and
promulgation may be made by simply recording the judgment in the criminal docket
with a copy thereof served upon his counsel, provided that the notice <span style="">requiring
him to be present at the promulgation is served through his bondsmen or warden
and counsel.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having disposed of the first issue raised by the
accused-appellants, we now come to the second, third and fourth assigned errors
which shall be discussed jointly, considering that they are interrelated and
deal with the question of whether or not the guilt of the accused-appellants
was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants contend that the trial court erred in
relying on the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Antonio Silvano, Wilson
Silvano and Visitacion Silvano and in concluding that they clearly and
positively identified the accused?<span style="">appellants as the culprits.  According to them, only Antonio Silvano
testified that he saw the accused burn his house, kill his wife Rizalina </span><span style="">a</span><span style="">nd drag her into the fire.  Neither Visitacion Silvano nor Wilson
Silvano testified that they saw what occurred in the elder Silvanos'
house.  But even the testimony of
Antonio Silvano is not reliable because it lacks truthfulness and
validity.  They singled out his
testimony that while the fire was raging, his wife told him to save himself as
she will also save herself, then the direction of the wind changed and he
jumped from the roof of the house into the bushes.  They concluded that he could not have seen who killed his wife.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Also, the
ruling that conclusions and findings of the lower court </span><span style="">are </span><span style="">entitled to great weight is not
applicable in this case </span>because the judge who heard the testimonies of
the witnesses in its entirety was not the same judge who penned the
decision.  They further stressed the
delay incurred by Antonio in reporting the crime to the authorities.  The crime was committed on 28 January 1980
but he reported it to the Office of the Governor of Negros Oriental in
Dumaguete City only on 18 February 1980 or some 21 days after its
commission.  Finally, they maintain that
they have sufficiently established their defense of alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Appellee seeks the affirmance of the
judgment convicting the accused.  The
Appellee reasons out that the accused-appellants were positively identified by
prosecution witness Antonio Silvano; and that even while it is true that only Antonio
Silvano saw the murderers, Visitacion and Wilson Silvano testified on the
presence of the accused-appellants at the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Appellee admits, however, the most damning testimony
against the accused-appellants in this case is only that of Antonio Silvano who
claimed that he actually saw them hack and kill his wife.  To us, whether such testimony could be
relied upon is altogether a different matter.  Although it is a settled rule that the findings of the trial court on
the credibility of witnesses should be given the highest respect because it had
the advantage of observing the demeanor of the witnesses and can discern if
such witnesses are telling the truth or lying through their teeth,<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
we cannot rely on that rule in this appeal because the judge who heard the
testimonies of the witnesses was not the <span style="">same judge who penned the decision.  Judge Temistocles Diez of Branch 37 received
and heard the testimonies of the witnesses but it was Judge Pacifico S. Bulado
who rendered the decision.  The latter
had no opportunity to observe the witnesses' deportment and manner of
testifying, which are important considerations in assessing credibility.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully read the transcripts of the testimony of
Antonio Silvano.  We cannot give him full
faith and credit for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Although he testified on cross-examination that he first
reported the incident to and was investigated by the PC, it is clear to this
Court that it was only on 15 February 1980, or on the eighteenth day after the
incident that he was investigated at the office of the Governor.  Being the barangay captain of Nagbinlud, the
owner of a house that was intentionally set on fire, the father of the man who
was hacked several times and almost died, and the husband of the murder victim
whose body was charred beyond recognition, the compelling call of duty and the
mournful cry for justice cannot tolerate any delay in reporting the incident to
the proper authorities.  The prosecution
was hard put for an explanation for this delay; it did not even attempt to make
any.  If Antonio Silvano could offer no
explanation therefor, it could only mean that he was either unable to identify
the real perpetrators of the crime against his family or he was afraid to do
so.  For whichever reason, such failure
only bolsters the claim of the defense that the crime was committed by the
"Salvatore" group whose operations Antonio admitted he was very much
aware of, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As such barangay captain you remember that
in the month of January, 1980 there was such a group of armed men referred to
or commonly called as Salvatore, is that correct that used to roam around in
the interior part of Sta. Catalina?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
that is true.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
this group of men used <span style="">to </span>plunder
or steal from houses, kill certain persons and burn also houses, is that
correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
that is true.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
this group of men known as 'Salvatore' continued to exist even after January
1980?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
was only up to 1980.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
but after January 1980 this 'Salvatore' group continued to exist for sometime
up to or beyond the year 1980, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
were only about 2 weeks because they were arrested by the authorities.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
is two weeks after January 28, 1980?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is doubtful whether Antonio did report the
incident to the PC as no PC personnel corroborated him thereon and according to
him, he did not sign any statement during the said investigation, which is
unusual.  The fiscal himself admitted in
open court that no statement taken by the PC was submitted to his office.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
If indeed Antonio was investigated by the PC, the investigator should have
formally taken his statement in view of its importance.  As no such statement was proved to exist, it
is logical to presume that Antonio did not or could not disclose to the
investigator the names of the perpetrators.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Antonio admitted on cross-examination that he had no quarrel
and misunderstanding<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a> or
grudges<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
whatsoever with the accused-appellants.  If that were so, it is odd that he could not explain why he, a barangay
captain who was expected to attend to the requests and problems of his
constituents, deliberately chose not to respond to the alleged call of the
accused-appellants on the night of the incident and instead allowed his wife to
lie to them by saying that he was attending a meeting.  Again, the only plausible explanation for
his behavior was that the men who came belonged to the "Salvatore"
group and this terrified him, for he knew that the group had been roaming
around, killing people and burning houses in his area.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Also, on cross-examination, Antonio affirmed as true the
contents of his sworn statement<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
taken two weeks after the incident.  In
it, he failed to state the fact that he witnessed the killing <span style="">of </span>his wife and to identify her
killers.<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
Since his sworn statement was precisely taken to obtain from him vital facts
relative to the incident, more specifically on the killing of his wife, and
considering that he had already stated therein that he saw the
accused-appellants, it is contrary to human nature and inconsistent with
experience for him to fail to identify them as the killers of his wife, if such
is the fact.  It has been said that
where the omission in the affidavit refers to a very important detail such that
the affiant would not have failed to mention it, the omission could affect the
affiant's credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
Verily, it was obvious from his answer to Question No. 16 of the investigator
that he had no opportunity to identify the killers:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Question No. 16, 'Q-What else did you do?',
and you answered, 'A-My wife told me to just save myself because <span style="">she </span>will also save herself.  Thereafter the wind changed it(s) course and
(the) fire grew big and because of this, I had the occasion to jumped (sic)
from our house and thereafter I ran towards the bushes.' x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, that is true.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How far is that bush to
which you ran from your house which was burning?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>about thirty (30) meters because it
is <span style="">a </span>sugarcane field."<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">4. Antonio categorically declared that Engracio Valeriano,
Juanito Rismundo and Macario Acabal each hacked her once hitting her on the
forehead, right leg and left arm, respectively, while Abundio Nahid hacked her
four times, hitting her at the forehead, left arm, right leg and stomach.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, from his testimony, his wife sustained seven wounds.  Yet, the medical evidence belies this.  Per the findings of Dr. Avelino Torres,<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
there were only three "evidence" of hacking, <i>viz</i>.:  at the right leg, left leg and abdomen.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. Nowhere in his sworn statement did Antonio mention the name of
accused-appellant Abundio Nahid.  If in
fact he saw the latter who he claimed in his direct testimony hacked his wife
four times, Nahid's name would have occupied a prominent place in his sworn
statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the other witnesses for the prosecution likewise
do not provide sufficient proof of the accused?appellants' guilt.  Visitacion Silvano's testimony that she saw
and identified the accused-appellants at the scene of the crime taxes the
imagination.  It was humanly impossible
for her to see the accused-appellants even if she were aided by the light from
the truck as she herself said that she was then in her house, three kilometers
away from the house of her parents-in-law.  <span style="">Wilson
Silvano did not testify at all that he saw the persons who hacked and killed
his mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In conclusion, because of reasonable doubt as to their guilt, the
accused-appellants must be acquitted.  Every accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; that
presumption is solemnly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.  The contrary requires proof beyond
reasonable doubt, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an
unprejudiced mind.  Short of this, it is
not only the right of the accused to be freed; it is even the constitutional
duty of the court to acquit <span style="">him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">
Accordingly, unless the prosecution discharges its burden of proving the guilt
of the accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt, they need not even offer
evidence in their behalf.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The
weakness of their defense of alibi thus becomes irrelevant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
