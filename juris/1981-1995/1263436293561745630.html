<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an administrative complaint filed by Venus Tidalgo Ferrer
against respondent Demetrio G. Gapasin, Sr. in his capacity as Interpreter of
the Regional <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Trial Court of
Tayug, Pangasinan, Branch 52 for GROSS </span>MISCONDUCT.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears on record that on December 5, 1991, the Municipal
Circuit Trial Court of Natividad-San Quintin, Pangasinan rendered a decision
against complainant Venus Tidalgo Ferrer and her husband in Civil Case No. 153
for Forcible Entry.  Not satisfied with
said decision, complainant appealed to the Regional Trial Court of Tayug,
Branch 52.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant met respondent during the scheduled hearing of the
appealed case on March 12, 1992, where the latter offered his assistance to
expedite the case in her favor for P25,000.00.  Complainant agreed and gave to respondent at his residence, the
following amounts:</p>

<blockquote>March 18, 1992<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-  P5,000.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>March 23, 1992<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 10,000.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>April 13, 1992<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <u>10,000.00<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>TOTAL  <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>=  P25,000.00</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 8, 1992, the Regional Trial Court of Tayug affirmed <i>in
toto</i> the decision of the Municipal Circuit trial court which became final
and executory on August 1, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">When complainant confronted respondent why she lost the case, the
latter told her that "he is powerless to decide the case"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and promised to return her money.  Despite several verbal demands, respondent failed to return the
P25,000.00 causing the complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">to
file a sworn affidavit on August 5, 1992, alleging gross misconduct on the part
of the respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Romulo Lui, who drove for complainant when the latter went to the
house of respondent, corroborated complainant's testimony and testified that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x (in the morning of March 18, 1992) x x x Mrs. Ferrer
(complainant) rode in his tricycle and went to the house of Benny Gapasin
(respondent) in Luna Street, Tayug, Pangasinan.  Mrs. Ferrer went upstairs to the house of Benny Gapasin and after
twenty (20) minutes, they went home.  On
the way [home], Mrs. Ferrer allegedly told witness:  ‘I delivered the money he was asking’ (pp. 30-33, Vol. II, TSN,
Apr. 22, 1993).  In the afternoon of
March 23, 1992, together with Mrs. Ferrer and her brother, Edwin Tidalgo, he
drove the jeepney of Mrs. Ferrer and again went to the house of Benny
Gapasin.  Mrs. Ferrer and her brother
Edwin Tidalgo went upstairs.  Mrs.
Ferrer was holding an envelop[e] containing P10,000.00 as he was told.  The first time they went to the house of
Gapasin, Mrs. Ferrer told him she gave P5,000.00 to Gapasin in an envelope
also.  At around 6:00 o'clock p.m., on
April 13, 1992, together with Mrs. Ferrer and her brother Edwin, he went again
to the house of respondent Gapasin driving the same jeep.  Mrs. Ferrer and Edwin told me (Romulo Lui)
they delivered P10,000.00 to Benny Gapasin."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Judge Pedro C. Cacho, Executive Judge and
Investigator of the Regional Trial Court of Tayug, Pangasinan as well as the
presiding judge of Branch 52 issued a Memorandum<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> to
respondent requiring him to explain in writing why no disciplinary action shall
be <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">taken against him on the
basis of the sworn complaint filed by Mrs. Venus Ferrer.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with said directive, respondent submitted an
undated and unsubscribed statement<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
claiming that the money allegedly given to him by the complainant was actually
a loan he secured from her to pay for the hospitalization of his grandmother as
evidenced by a Real Estate Mortgage<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> dated
July 25, 1992, executed by him as mortgagor in favor of complainant.  Respondent further maintained that it was
only on February 11, 1992 that he learned that complainant had a case pending
in Branch 52, where he is employed as court interpreter, and he told
complainant that he would see what he can do to expedite the case.  He never promised complainant, however, that
he can secure a favorable decision for her as he is not in a position to comply
with such promise.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 11, 1992, complainant in her Reply-Affidavit<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
denied all the allegations of the respondent and disclaimed any knowledge about
the Real Estate Mortgage allegedly executed in her favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Judge Cacho reported the matter to the Court
Administrator and respondent was placed under preventive suspension on December
8, 1992 pursuant to the Supreme Court's Resolution dated October 12, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 15, 1993, the Supreme Court issued a Resolution
assigning this case to Judge Cacho for investigation, report and recommendation
within ninety (90) days from notice which was received by the latter on March
22, 1993.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the scheduled investigation or on April 20, 1993, respondent
and his PAO counsel failed to appear despite due notice.  Instead, respondent's counsel filed an
Omnibus Motion<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
indorsing his case to another counsel, namely, Atty. Eugenio Tolentino, Jr. as
the incumbent counsel is going on sick leave.  Thereafter, complainant testified and presented her documentary
evidences.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that same date, respondent filed with the Supreme Court a
Motion to Inhibit Judge Cacho from proceeding with the administrative case and
filed with Judge Cacho an undated Manifestation informing the Judge of his
non-attendance in the administrative proceedings until the Supreme Court has
ruled on his Motion.  Nonetheless, Judge
Cacho proceeded with the investigation of the administrative case in compliance
with the Supreme Court's Resolution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 10, 1993, Judge Cacho submitted his report recommending
the outright dismissal of respondent from the government service, the pertinent
portion of which reads, as follows:.</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">"The
testimonial and documentary evidences adduced </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">ex-parte</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">by Complainant as </span>hereinbefore
set forth establishes by preponderance of evidence that Respondent did in truth
and in fact received (sic) the sum of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00)
from Complainant with the promise that Respondent will expedite the decision of
the Court on the appealed case and see to it that said decision will be in
favor of Complainant.  Being the
incumbent Interpreter of the Court as he had informed Complainant, Respondent
was able to convince Complainant to give money to him believing that Respondent
will fulfill his promise.  In other words,
Complainant completely believed Respondent when he said:  ‘Nobody can get near Judge Cacho except me.’
(p. 24, Vol. II, TSN, Apr. 20, 1993).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is certainly no basis in fact and in law when
Respondent claimed in his unsubscribed statement (p.22/Exh. 'C', Rec.) that he
executed a <u>Real Estate Mortgage</u> in favor of Complainant to cover the
loan of P25,000.00 the latter gave him (p. 24, Rec.).  From the notarial report of Notary Public Florencio M. Suyat,
Jr., submitted to the Clerk of Court of RTC-Tayug, Pangasinan, it appears that
Doc. No. 431, Page No. 87, Book II, Series of 1992, is a <u>Deed of Chattel
Mortgage</u> (<u>Annex ‘F’</u>), not a Real Estate Mortgage as claimed by
Respondent.  An ocular examination of
the original carbon of the ‘Real Estate Mortgage’ which Respondent attached to
his statement shows that the title 'Deed of Chattel Mortgage' was erased and in
lieu thereof, the title 'Real Estate Mortgage' was typed.  It should be noted that there are still
traces of erasures on the latter document.  Moreover, a Real Estate Mortgage to be valid and binding among the
parties must be signed by both parties with the marital consent of their
spouses, if applicable.  The 'Real
Estate Mortgage' alleged to have been executed by Respondent in favor of
Complainant was signed only by him.  The
mortgage then partakes the nature of a unilateral contract which is contrary to
law, when in fact it should be bilateral in order to be a valid and legal
mortgage.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">"The
testimony of Complainant to the effect that the two (2) daughters of
Respondent, his wife, and Rev. Father Mendoza (Parish Priest, Roman Catholic
Church, Tayug, </span>Pangasinan) approached her and asked her to withdraw the
case because they will return the money (p. 25, Vol. II, TSN, April 20, 1993)
bolsters the conclusion that Respondent did the act complained of.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">"Therefore,
by his own act of demanding and receiving the sum of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos
(P25,000.00) from Complainant, a party litigant in a case pending in the sala
of the court where he is the Interpreter, under the facts and circumstances </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">aforestated,
Respondent Demetrio G. Gapasin, Sr., committed 'gross misconduct', which is a </span>ground
for disciplinary action under Presidential Decree No. 807, otherwise known as
the ‘Civil Service Decree of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Philippines’.”</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">After a careful and thorough review of the record, we sustain the
findings and recommendation of Judge Cacho.  The act of respondent in demanding and accepting money from the
complainant to expedite the resolution of a case cannot be countenanced,
especially when it is committed by an employee of the court who ought be an
example of integrity, uprightness and honesty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this Court has emphasized time and time again that the
conduct and behavior of every one connected with an office charged with the
dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the sheriff and to the
lowliest clerk should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.  Their conduct, at all times, must be
characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be above and
beyond suspicion.  For every employee of
the judiciary should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Respondent's misconduct, misfeasance or malfeasance in the performance of his
official duties consisting of dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best
interest of the service, are grounds for dismissal under the Civil Service Law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> respondent DEMETRIO G. GAPASIN is found guilty
of gross misconduct and is hereby DISMISSED from the service with prejudice to
reinstatement or re­-employment in any agency of the government, including
government-owned or controlled corporations.  All retirement benefits and other privileges to which he may be entitled
are forfeited except for his leave credits to which he may be entitled.</p>
