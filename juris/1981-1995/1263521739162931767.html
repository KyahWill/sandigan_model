This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Pangasinan, 3rd Judicial District, Branch IX, convicting Jose Marzan 
alias "Carling" of the crime of rape.  The dispositive portion of the 
decision reads:
<blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the Court finds the 
accused, JOSE MARZAN alias CARLING, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
the crime of RAPE as charged and hereby sentences him to suffer the 
penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>; to indemnify the offended party,
 Saturnina Esteves Vda. de Rondolos, in the sum of TWELVE THOUSAND 
(P12,000.00) PESOS and to pay the costs."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The information dated April 27, 1978 against the defendant-appellant reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 26th day of January, 1978, in the afternoon,
 at Barangay San Vicente East, municipality of Urdaneta, province of 
Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the juris­diction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, did, then, and there, by means of force 
and intimidation, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously did lie, and 
succeed in having carnal knowledge of said complainant against her will.
 </p>
  <p> "Contrary to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The facts established by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court
 as basis for the decision are summarized by the court as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    xxx                <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span>                   xxx
  </p>
  <p> "From the evidence presented, it has been established that on 
January 26, 1978, at about 2:00 to 3:00 o'clock p.m., the accused, Jose 
Marzan arrived at the store of Saturnina Esteves Vda. de Rondolos, a 
thirty-year old widow, at barrio San Vicente East, Urdaneta, Pangasinan,
 and ordered a bottle of beer.  While he was drinking his beer, he told 
Saturnina that his wife had just won the 'jueteng' and that she was 
going to pay their account with the store of more than P100.00.  He also
 told Saturnina that his wife wanted her to go to their house to get the
 payment. </p>
  <p> "Saturnina went to the Marzan house which was fifty (50) meters 
away in the same barrio.  When she knocked at the door, it was opened by
 the accused, Jose Marzan.  When she inquired for his wife, 'Manang 
Eling', he answered that she was in the room.  She went upstairs to the 
room and he followed her.  When she set foot in the room, he pointed a 
'balisong' at the side of her neck and pressed it.  She was very much 
frightened.  He pushed her into the room and boxed her and she fell flat
 on her back.  He looked like a 'dog' who wanted to 'eat' her up.  He 
then hit her two thighs hard with the handle of the 'balisong' and she 
lost consciousness from pain and fright.  When she regained 
conscious­ness, he was on top of her hurriedly having sexual intercourse
 with her.  She could not push the accused for her body felt heavy.  She
 could not shout for she was shocked and felt very weak.  She found her 
panties near her foot.  When he finished and she was about to get up to 
put on her panties, he again pointed the 'balisong' at her neck and told
 her that if she reported the matter to her relatives, he would kill all
 of them.  He left her alone.  She put on her panties and went home. </p>
  <p> "During all this time, there was nobody in the house but a 
mentally deranged daughter of the accused who was chained in the ground 
floor of the house.  The wife of the accused was in the fields and she 
took her lunch with her and was not expected until afternoon. </p>
  <p>
  When Saturnina arrived home, she went to her room and cried.  She 
reported to her mother and her mother told her that they would wait for 
her brother, Marcial, who was stationed in Sangley Point, Cavite.
  </p>
  <p> "When her brother, Marcial Esteves, arrived on January 30, 1978, 
they waited for him to finish his lunch before they reported the matter 
to him.  He did not want the filing of the case to be delayed so he, 
together with brothers, Pastor and Marcos, accompanied Saturnina to the 
barangay captain Dolores Arangorin’s house at San Vicente.  Barargay 
Captain Arangorin, upon hearing their report, ordered Councilman Felipe 
de Guzman to call the accused Jose Marzan, but he could not be located. 
 She asked the complainant to return the next morning, January 31, 1978.
 </p>
  <p> "The next day, in the morning and afternoon, Arangorin sent 
Councilman de Guzman together with three (3) barangay tanods, Rudy 
Limos, Pedro Ramos and Perfecto Figuracion but again they were not able 
to locate the accused, Jose Marzan.  Arangorin advised Saturnine and her
 brother to file their complaint in court. </p>
  <p> "At the Urdaneta Police Station where they went the next day, Pat.
 Benjamin Madrid told them to secure a medical certificate first from a 
doctor.  They proceeded to the Urdaneta Emergency Hospital where 
Saturnina was examined by Dra. Blandina Caducoy who noted the contusions
 on her body in her medical certificate, Exhibit 'A'.  She told them to 
have the police pick up the medical certificate. </p>
  <p> "Pat. Madrid called Saturnina on February 6, 1978, and he took 
dawn her statement by questions and answers and the complaint, Exhibit 
'B', was filed in the municipal court. </p>
  <p> "Saturnine claimed that her honor had been stained and the was 
exposed to public ridicule, thus suffering moral damages in the amount 
of P50,000.00.  She also spent litigation expenses in the amount of 
P3,000.00." (<em>Rollo</em>, pp. 22-25). </p>
  <p align="center">

</blockquote>
<p>
On February 6, 1978, Dr. Blandina N. Caducoy, resident physician of the 
Urdaneta General Hospital examined Saturnina Esteves.  The medico-legal 
certificate contained the following findings:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Diagnosis:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        - Contusion old neck (L)
    </p>
    <p>
        - Contusion old breast bilateral
    </p>
    <p>
        - Contusion medial (old) thigh (R)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand, the defendant-appellant did not deny that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant.  He claims:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The theory of the defense is that the sexual intercourse that 
ocurred on that day was one among the several intercourses which were 
done voluntarily by both of them.  The first occasion was on <em>November 22, 1977</em>, then <em>November 28</em>, Monday, then <em>December 16</em>, Wednesday, and the last was <em>January 26, 1978</em>.
  Since they had sexual intercourse many times accused could only 
remember a few.  He never had a quarrel with her or any misunderstanding
 during those days and they were very romantic.  He was told by de 
Guzman that there was a complaint filed against him.  On the date of the
 last inter­course, January 26, 1978 the door of the room was opened.  
That Saturnina Esteves Vda. de Rondolos enjoyed her sexual intercourse. 
 That she had never been remorseful about their relationship.  That the 
injuries of Saturnina as reflected in the medical certificate (Exh. A) 
was the result of the maltreatment inflicted by Saturnina's brother 
Marcial upon his arrival.  He was then mad and even called her 
prostitute.  The accused-appellant disclaims that theory of the 
prosecution; that he never used force and intimidation during that 
occasion."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defendant-appellant made the following assignments of errors in his appeal:
</p><p align="center">
I
</p><p align="center">
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING MORE CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE 
WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION, PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE OFFENDED PARTY 
RATHER THAN THE NATURAL, LOGICAL AND COHERENT TESTIMONIES OF THE 
WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE AND THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT HIMSELF.
</p><p align="center">
II

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE INTERCOURSE HAD BETWEEN JOSE 
MARZAN, alias 'CARLING', ACCUSED-APPELLANT AND SATURNDINA ESTEVES VDA. 
DE RONDOLOS, COMPLAINANT, ON JANUARY 26, 1978 WAS OBTAINED THROUGH 
FORCE, VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.
</p><p align="center">
III
</p><p align="center">
THE LOWER COURT ERRED 1N DECIDING THE CASE MORE ON HUMAN CONSIDERATION 
RATHER THAN ON THE LOGICAL TEST OF REASON, ORDINARY EXPERIENCE, AND 
OBSERVATION OF MANKIND.
</p><p align="center">
IV
</p><p align="center">

CERTAIN FACTS OF SUBSTANCE AND VALUE IN RENDERING THE GUILTY VERDICT.
</p><p align="center">
V
</p><p align="center">
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT UNDER THE MANDATORY RULE OF REASONABLE DOUBT.
</p><p>
All of the assigned errors raise the issue of credi­bility of witnesses.
  We have carefully reviewed the records of the case in the light of the
 appellant's arguments on appeal but we find no reason to depart from 
the established rule that appellate courts will generally not disturb 
the findings of the trial court, considering that it is in a better 
position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves 
and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial,
 unless the court has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and 
value that, if considered, might affect the result of the case.  (People
 v. Eddie Gamez, 124 SCRA 260 and cases cited therein.)
</p><p>
That there was sexual intercourse is established.  While the 
defendant-appellant admits that he had sexual inter­course with 
Saturnina Esteves Vda. de Rondolos on January 26, 1978, he insists that 
it was by mutual desire and with the offended party's consent.  
Defendant-appellant submits that he and Saturnina have had amorous 
relationships and that the January 26 intercourse was not the first one 
but was only one of the several intercourses between them.
</p><p>
It is evident that force and intimidation were employed by the appellant
 in having sexual intercourse with the victim.  Medical findings attest 
to the use of violence.  Saturnina testified that she was pushed and 
boxed on both her thighs and that the appellant pressed the point of a 
"balisong" on the left side of her neck when she was about to shout and 
struggle.  Thus, -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q   When he told you that his wife who sent for you was in the roan, what happened next after that? </p>
  <p> "A    Because he told me that his wife is inside the room, I went 
to the room and upon stepping my feet inside the room, he held me and 
pointed a balisong on the left side of my neck. </p>
  <p> "Q   Men the accused Jose Marzan held you and pointed a balisong 
against the left side of your neck, what else happened, if anything 
happened? </p>
  <p> "A    I was very much frightened and I was about to shout but he 
pressed the point of the balisong on my neck.  I was about to struggle 
and shout for help but I could not. </p>
  <p> "Q   Why could you not shout for help and struggle against his hold? </p>
  <p> "A    Yes, sir, because he pressed the point of the balisong harder on my neck and if I will cry or shout I might die. </p>
  <p> "Q   At the time you attempted to shout for help and cry and 
struggle frail the hold of the accused, what else did he do to you, if 
he did anything more? </p>
  <p> "A    He pushed me inside the room. </p>
  <p> "Q   While you were pushed inside the room, what again did Jose Marzan do if he did anything? </p>
  <p> "A    He boxed me immediately, sir. </p>
  <p> "Q   Which part of your body did he immediately box? </p>
  <p> "A    Here, sir (witness pointing to her the front portion of her thighs). </p>
  <p> "Q   With what did he use in hitting your thighs? </p>
  <p> "A    The handle of the balisong, sir. </p>
  <p> "Q   And when he hit you with the handle of the balisong on both your things, what happened to you? </p>
  <p> "A    I fell down unconscious, sir. </p>
  <p> "Q   When you fell down unconscious, have you ever regained your consciousness afterwards? </p>
  <p> "A    Yes, sir.  When I regained consciousness Jose Marzan was already on top of me." (TSN, June 13, 1979, pp. 41-42) </p>

  <p> "Q    At the time you fell unconscious and after you gained

were wearing? </p>

 Jose Marzan, the accused, had already committed carnal knowledge with 
you, what did you do if you ever did anything after that? </p>
  <p> "A    When I was about to get up and put on my panties, I was 
again approached by the accused and pointed again his balisong on my 
neck. </p>
  <p> "Q   When Jose Marzan pointed his balisong against your neck once 
more after he had committed carnal knowledge against your will and 
consent, what if any did he tell you? </p>
  <p> "A    He told me that if I will report this matter to my relatives, he will kill all of us." (TSN, June 13, 1979, pp. 43-44) </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    Appellant claims that Saturnina was his mistress.  To corroborate 
this defense, he presented Jesus Aduca, Ernesto Figuracion and Camilo 
Ecaviza who testified to the same effect.
  </p>
<p> After a careful review of the records, we find no basis to disturb 
the trial court's findings that the testi­monies for the accused are not
 credible and its conclusion that the appellant's theory is incredible. 
 The lower court ruled: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="center">
    xxx                <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span> xxx </p>
    <p> "Jesus Aduca, his wife's cousin mentioned that on December 27, 
1977, he saw the accused and Saturnina embracing and kissing in the 
accused's house.  He said he was gathering <em>chicos </em>from the tree
 fronting the window of the house.  He also related the time when the 
accused was not made to pay for their drinks in the store of Saturnina. </p>
    <p> "The testimony of Aduca is incredible coming as it does from the
 relatives of the accused who 'offered' to help him.  Being a relative 
of the wife of the accused and being a neighbor, his first instinct 
should have been to report the matter to his cousin, Mrs. Marzan, to 
protect their marriage, instead of testifying in an effort to absolve 
the accused of an 'illicit affair'.  His testimony is unbelievable. </p>
    <p> "More incredible was the story of Camilo Ellorda who allegedly 
knew that Marzan was the paramour of Saturnina.  He could not even 
remember the dates, the time or number of times he had seen Saturnina in
 Marzan's house.  Such matters, which could certainly arouse the 
curiosity of a neighbor-onlooker, would be remembered by a neighbor only
 twenty (20) meters distant if his testimony were not a fabrication. </p>
    <p> "Ernesto Figuracion, another close relative of Marten, sought to
 impugn the testimony of Saturnina regarding her injuries at the time of
 the incident by pointing to Marcial Esteves as the person who inflicted
 the injuries on January 30, 1978.  This is belied by the medical 
examination conducted on February 1, 1978, Exhibit 'A', when the 
contusions on Saturnina's body were found to be 'old contusions' and, as
 testified to by Dra. Caducoy, were four (4) to five (5) days old.  His,
 prevarications included the day of the injuries as January 30 or Rizal 
Day for it was so indicated in the calendar. </p>
    <p> "He even testified that he saw the sexual intercourse because he went up the house to ask for <em>kamias</em>,
 which testimony is contrary to his statement that he never left his 
house from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in that day of January 30, 1978, Rizal
 Day. </p>
    <p> "Camilo Ecaviza tried to corroborate the story of Figuracion 
about the maltreatment of Marcial Esteves on Saturnina.  He said there 
were about ten (10) persons who saw the incident and he pointed to the 
thigh, the neck and the breast as the parts of the body hurt by Marcial.
  Still, his testimony, coming as it does from biased source, being a 
neighbor of the accused, fails in the same manner, as that of 
Figuracion.  For if the injuries were inflicted on January 30, 1978, why
 were they found to be 'old contusions' by Dra. Caducoy (Exh. 'A'), on 
February 1, 1978? </p>
    <p> "The accused testified that he had no quarrel with his 
'mistress', Saturnina.  That they had sexual intercourse for several 
times.  Why would Saturnina file a complaint against him?  He had sexual
 intercourse with her four (4) times before.  These had been romantic 
according to his rehearsed witnesses.  He had made her happy.  Why would
 she report her lover to her family and the authorities for such a 
serious crime as rape?  It would be natural for her to keep her glorious
 silence and continue her passionate and delicious liaison."
      </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant argues that the injuries sustained by the complainant (Exhibit
 "A") may have been inflicted by her brother Marcial out of rage and 
uncontrollable passion when he learned of the illicit affairs between 
her sister and the accused.
</p><p>
It should be remembered that Marcial arrived only on January 30, 1978.  
Considering that Saturnina was examined on February 1, 1978 by Dr. 
Caducoy and that the medical certificate issued by her states that the 
injuries were "old" or inflicted about five or six days ago, it is 
impossible that Marcial could have inflicted the same on his sister.  
Furthermore, the brother was insistent on not delaying the investigation
 of the crime and the filing of the case, upon his arrival and being 
told of the assault.
</p><p>
Appellant also points out certain inconsistencies in the testimonies of 
prosecution witnesses Marcial Esteves, Barangay Captain Dolores 
Arangorin, and Saturnina Esteves.  Marcial testified that when he went 
to the house of the Barangay Captain to report the crime he went there 
alone whereas in the testimony of the barangay captain, she declared 
that the complainant was accompanied by Marcia Esteves and Pastor 
Esteves.  On the other hand, Saturnina declared that her companions were
 her brothers Marcial Esteves, Pastor Esteves, Marcos Esteves and sister
 Rosario  Esteves.
</p><p>
The above inconsistencies refer to minor and collateral matters that do 
not impair the credibility of Marcial Esteves, the Barangay Captain, and
 the complainant.  Whether or not Marcial Esteves was alone throughout 
the reporting of the crime or he went ahead only to be followed by 
others or he went there with a group from the very start does not affect
 the issue of whether there was rape or voluntary sex.
</p><p>
We apply the rule laid down in <em>People v. Reyes </em>(69 SCRA 476) -
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    xxx                <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span> xxx </p>
  <p> "The discrepancies signify that the two witnesses did not 
deliberately pervert the truth in their narrations.  The discordance in 
their testimonies on collateral matters heightens their credibility and 
shows that their testimonies were not coached nor rehearsed.  (People v.
 Doria, 55 SCRA 435) Far from being evidence of falsehood they could 
justifiably be regarded as a demonstration of their good faith.  (People
 v. Cabiltes, 25 SCRA 112; and People v. Alcantara, L-26568, June 30, 
1970)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In assailing Saturnina's credibility, appellant contends that it is 
common knowledge that in the locality there was no such "jueteng", and 
that Saturnina could just have asked accused or his wife to come back 
and pay their debts and not for her to go to the house of the accused to
 collect the same.  Appellant also argues that Saturnina had all the 
opportunity to call for help but did not make any outcry.
</p><p>
The defendant-appellant's contentions do not deserve serious 
consideration.  Whether or not the "jueteng" where the appellant's wife 
won a bet was in their locality or elsewhere is immaterial because 
Saturnina was made to believe that the appellant and his wife were ready
 to pay their debts from jueteng winnings and that she went to their 
house to collect the same.  The records further show that Saturnina did 
not have any opportunity to shout or to cry for help because of fright 
when the appellant pressed the point of the balisong on her neck.
</p><p>
Appellant next questions complainant's delay in lodging her complaint.  
Appellant submits that the incident happened on January 26, 1978 yet it 
took her five (5) days or on January 30, 1978 before she finally 
reported the matter to the barangay captain.  The information was filed 
on April 27, 1978.
</p><p>
Complainant was able to satisfactorily explain this delay.  She testified:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "FISCAL RAMIREZ </p>
  <p> "Q   When you made a report of what Jose Marzan did to you, what did your mother say, if she ever said anything? </p>
  <p> "A    He told me that we will wait for my brother Marcial. </p>
  <p> "Q   Where as your brother Marcial at the time you made the report of what Jose Marzan did to you? </p>
  <p> "A    He was in Cavite, sir. </p>
  <p> "Q   What was he doing there in Cavite? </p>
  <p> "A    He is a soldier, sir. </p>
  <p> "Q   Were you able to wait for your brother Marcial to come home? </p>
  <p> "A    We were able to wait for him on the 30th of June." (TSN, June 13, 1979, p. 45) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We agree with the Solicitor-General that the close family ties among 
Filipinos, particularly the provincial folks, require that a family 
consensus be arrived at first before a family dishonor can be made 
public by reporting to the authorities.  (People v. Jore, et al., 93 
Phil. 1017, 1021).
</p><p>
Relative to the third assignment of error, defendant-appellant contends 
that the lower court decided the case more on human consideration rather
 than on the logical test of reason, ordinary experience, and 
observation of mankind.  The appellant submits that complainant could 
not fall under the category of unsuspecting provinciana because aside 
from having illicit affairs with the appellant, she had already 
travelled abroad and was already thirty (30) years old at the time of 
the incident.
</p><p>
That Saturnina travelled abroad and that she was already thirty (30) 
years old do not alter the fact that she was craftily lured by appellant
 to go to his house and once there, was raped by him.
</p><p>
The following findings of the trial court are sustained by the evidence in the records:
</p><blockquote>

another neighbor came forward only during the trial to reveal the tale 
of lust when their first reaction should have been to protect the family
 of their relative by reporting the infidelity and dishonor in her awn 
house to their relative, the wife of the accused.  They fingered Marcial
 Esteves as the person responsible for the injuries of his sister on 
January 30, 1978, when he allegedly found cut about the affair and 
called her a prostitute.  This is incredible.  Saturnina is a widow.  
She is 30 years old.  There was no need to castigate her brutally for 
the affair, it if were true.  It would be merely an act of an 
emancipated and consenting adult.  As shown by the testimonies of her 
witnesses, her family stood by her in her disgrace.  Her mother and her 
brothers helped her file the case against the accused.  She is not a 
young girl who would be maltreated by Marcial, who, throughout the 
hearing, despite his being situated at Sangley Point, Cavite, showed a 
genuine brotherly concern.  The acts attributed to him, the infliction 
of physical injuries on his sister, are not in keeping with his 
character as a disciplined member of the air force.  The fabricated 
story of the defense was woven so loosely that it disintegrated 
miserably and fell into tatters under cross-examination. </p>
  <p> "Saturnina Esteves Vda. de Rondolos related her ordeal in the 
manner expected from a woman who has been sexual outraged.  She was 
still young.  It stands to reason that as a trusting and unsuspecting 
'provinciana' she was lured to the house of the accused on the promise 
of the payment of their indebtedness.  Her straightforward story is 
clear and convincing.  Lured, duped and violated, the defense of the 
accused heaped further insults on her outraged honor and dignity."

  <p> The other matters raised by the defendant-appellant in his brief 
revolve around the same issue of credibility of witnesses.  As regards 
them, appellant has failed to show that the lower court overlooked or 
mistakenly inter­preted facts of substance and value, which if 
considered would affect the result of the case. </p>
