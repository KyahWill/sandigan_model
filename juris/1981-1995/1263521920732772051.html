On October 21, 1980, petitioner was charged with the crime of grave 
coercion in an information filed before the respondent court, which 
reads:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "That on or about July 2, 1979, in the municipality of Sta. 
Cruz, Province of Marinduque, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a public officer, 
being then the mayor of Sta. Cruz, Marinduque, taking advantage of his 
public position and which offense was committed in relation to his 
office, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously take 
over the operation and control of the gasoline station owned by Pedro 
Par, sell the gasoline therein to the public issuing the invoices of 
said gasoline station and some pieces of yellow pad paper for the 
purpose, and padlock the dispensing pump thereof without authority of 
law, depriving Pedro Par of the possession and exercise of a lawful 
trade or occupation, by means of threat, force and/or violence, thereby 
preventing said Pedro Par from doing something not prohibited by law or 
compelling him to do something against his will, whether it be right or 
wrong. </p>
    <p> "CONTRARY TO LAW."
              </p>
    <p>
      (p. 10, <em>Rollo</em>)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
On November 27, 1980, the information was amended with the insertion of 
the phrase "by ordering his policemen companions" between the words 
"Pedro Par" and "to sell the gasoline."
</p><p>
Petitioner filed a motion to quash the information principally on the 
ground that the respondent court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the 
case and that it should have been filed with the ordinary courts in 
Marinduque where the alleged crime was committed.
</p><p>
Respondent court denied the motion.  Hence, petitioner instituted this proceeding for <em>certiorari </em>seeking the same relief, alleging that -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  The offense for which he was charged is not related to his office as mayor;
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  The offense of grave coercion is not among those mentioned or 
determined by Section 4(c), Presidential Decree No. 1486, as amended; 
and
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  Assuming that respondent has jurisdiction to try this case, it 
committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the transfer of the 
hearing of the case to the Court of First Instance of Marinduque because
 all witnesses of both the prosecution and defense will have to come 
from Marinduque, a far away island.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Section 5, Article XIII of the Constitution, provides for the creation 
of a special court known as the Sandigan­bayan and defines the 
jurisdiction thereof.  It states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 5.  The National Assembly shall create a special court, to 
be known as Sandiganbayan, which shall have jurisdiction over criminal 
and civil cases involving graft and corrupt practices and such other 
offenses committed by public officers and employees, including those in 
government-owned or controlled corporations, in relation to their office
 as may be determined by law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is clear from the above-quoted constitutional provision that 
respondent court has jurisdictional competence not only over criminal 
and civil cases in­volving graft and corrupt practices committed by 
public officers and employees but also over other crimes committed by 
them in relation to their office, though not involving graft and corrupt
 practices, as may be determined by law.  The intention of the framers 
of the New Constitution is patent from the explicit language thereof as 
well as from Section 1 of the same Article XIII titled "Accountability 
of Public Officers," which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SECTION 1.  Public office is a public trust.  Public officers and
 employees shall serve with the highest degree of responsibility, 
integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, and shall remain accountable to the 
people."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is no merit in petitioner's contention that 'Section 4(c) of 
Presidential Decree No. 1486, as amended, is violative of the provision 
of Section 5 of Article XIII of the New Constitution because the former 
enlarges what the latter limited.  Said constitutional provision 
delegates to the lawmaking body the determination of "such other 
offenses" committed by public officers over which the Sandiganbayan 
shall have jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the President of the Philippines,
 exercising his lawmaking authority and prerogative vested in him by the
 Constitution, issued Presidential Decree No. 1486 which mandates in 
Section 4(c) thereof that the Sandiganbayan shall have jurisdiction over
 "other crimes or offenses committed by public officers or employees, 
including those employed in government-owned or controlled corporation, <em>in relation to their office</em>."
 (Italics supplied) When the lawmaking authority chose to include all 
public office-related offenses over which respondent court shall have 
jurisdiction, the courts will not review questions of legislative 
policy.  It is enough that the act is within the constitutional power of
 the lawmaking body or authority and, if it is, the courts are bound to 
follow and apply.
</p><p>
The original and amended information clearly alleged that petitioner 
took advantage of his position as mayor when he intimidated the gasoline
 station's owner in taking over the operation and control of the 
establishment, ordering his policemen to sell the gasoline therein and 
padlocking the dispensing pump thereof without legal authority.  Stated 
differently, if petitioner were not the mayor he would not have 
allegedly directed the policemen and the latter would not have followed 
his orders and instructions to sell Pedro Par's gasoline and padlock the
 station.  The fact that he is the mayor did not vest him with legal 
authority to take over the operations and control of complainant's 
gasoline station and padlock the same without observing due process.
</p><p>
The crime for which petitioner is charged, grave coercion, is penalized 
by arresto mayor and a fine not exceeding P500.00 under the first 
paragraph of Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.  
Respondent court, pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of 
Presidential Decree No. 1606, as amended, has concurrent jurisdiction 
with the regular courts.  Well established is the rule that once a court
 acquires jurisdiction in a case where said jurisdiction is concurrent 
with another court, it must continue exercising the same to the 
exclusion of all other courts.  In Laquian vs. Baltazar, 31 SCRA 551, We
 ruled that "in case of concurrent jurisdiction, it is axiomatic that 
the court first acquiring jurisdiction excludes the other courts." Thus,
 respondent's denial of petitioner's request for the transfer of the 
case to the Court of First Instance of Marinduque was well-grounded and 
certainly not a grave abuse of discretion.
</p><p>
It is true that on March 23, 1983, Presidential Decree No. 1861 amended 
Presidential Decree No. 1606, and it provides, among others, that where 
the penalty for offenses or felonies committed by public officers and 
employees in relation to their office does not exceed <em>prision correccional</em>
 or imprisonment for six (6) years, or fine of P6,000.00, they are no 
longer within the concurrent jurisdiction of respondent court and the 
regular courts but are now vested in the latter.  However, Section 2 of 
said Presidential Decree No. 1861 states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SECTION 2.  <em>All cases pending in the Sandiganbayan or in the appropriate courts</em> as of the date of the effectivity of this Decree <em>shall remain with and be disposed of by the courts where they are pending</em>." (Italics supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The information against petitioner was filed in 1980; therefore, 
respondent court retains jurisdiction over the case subject of instant 
petition.
</p><p>
The broad power of the New Constitution vests the respondent court with 
jurisdiction over "public officers and employees, including those in 
government-owned or controlled corporations." There are exceptions, 
however, like constitutional officers, particularly those declared to be
 removed by impeachment.  Section 2, Article XIII of the 1973 
Constitution provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 2.  The President, the Members of the Supreme Court, and the
 Members of the Constitutional Commissions shall be removed from office 
on impeachment for, and conviction of, culpable violation of the 
Constitution, treason, bribery, other high crimes, or graft and 
corruption."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, the above provision proscribes removal from office of the 
aforementioned constitutional officers by any other method; otherwise, 
to allow a public officer who may be removed solely by impeachment to be
 charged criminally while holding his office with an offense that 
carries the penalty of removal from office, would be violative of the 
clear mandate of the fundamental law.
</p><p>
Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, in his authoritative dissertation on 
the New Constitution, states that "judgment in cases of impeachment 
shall be limited to removal from office and disqualification to hold any
 office of honor, trust, or profit under the Republic of the 
Philippines, but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and 
subject to prosecution, trial, and punishment, in accordance with law.  
The above provision is a reproduction of what was found in the 1935 
Constitution.  It is quite apparent from the explicit character of the 
above provision that the effect of impeachment is limited to the loss of
 position and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust or 
profit under the Republic.  It is equally manifest that the party thus 
convicted may be proceeded against, tried and thereafter punished in 
accordance with law.  There can be no clearer expression of the 
constitutional intent as to the scope of the impeachment process (The 
Constitution of the Philippines, pp. 465-466)." The clear implication 
is, the party convicted in the impeachment proceeding shall nevertheless
 be liable and subject to prosecution, trial and punishment according to
 law; and that if the same does not result in a conviction and the 
official is not thereby removed, the filing of a criminal action "in 
accordance with law" may not prosper.
</p><p>

temporary restraining order issued on March 12, 1982 is hereby 
DISSOLVED.
