March 11, 1980) and Sangguniang Bayan Member of the same municipality (p. 26,
id.), respectively, At about 5:00 o'clock in the morning of January 5, 1979,
they were fatally shot at the ground floor of the house of victim Hilario Abogado
located at the poblacion.  At that time
Candida Abogado, eighteen year old daughter of victim Hilario Abogado, was in
bed upstairs.  When she heard the
gunshots coming from the groundfloor, she rushed downstairs.  She saw appellant Teofilo Simon in fatigue
trousers carrying a sack with the muzzle of a gun protruding.  Sensing that someone had noticed him,
appellant sprinted towards the back of the house (pp. 3-8, 10-12, t.s.n., Jan.
15, 1980).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Later, at about 6:00 o'clock in the morning of the same day,
appellant in fatigue trousers, arrived at the house of Maximo Sanchez at
barangay Sto. Rosario of the same municipality where he took a cup of
coffee.  He carried with him a sack with
an armalite rifle in it (pp. 5-7, 11-12, t.s.n., hearing of March 12, 1980).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the morning of the same day, Sgt. Emiliano Agbanawag of Aliaga
Police Station, together with three policemen, conducted an on-the-spot
investigation of the killings.  They
recovered two slugs (Exh. E) from the scene of the crime (pp. 13-14, 16,

<p class="BODY">It rejected accused's defense of alibi which it summarized in
this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"For his absolution, accused Teofilo Simon interposed the
defense of denial and alibi.  He claimed
that on January 5, 1979, when Hilario Abogado and Juan Salazar were killed, he
was staying in a place in Pateros, Fort Bonifacio, more particularly at No. 45
Tarhata St., Pambo, Metro Manila.  He
was employed as a bus conductor in one of the mini-buses owned and operated by
Hermogenes del Rosario.</blockquote>

<blockquote>His story is that on the night of January 4, 1979, after the
passenger bus in (sic) which he was a conductor had returned to the garage
about 11:00 to 11:30 o'clock in the evening, he went straight to their
quarters, shortly after turning over the earnings for the day to their
employer, Hermogenes del Rosario.  Inside their quarters, he had (sic) conversation with his bus driver,
Dennis Bataycan, and some co-workers.  He slept between 12:00 and 12:30 o'clock.  It was already January 5, 1979.  Around 5:00 to 5:30 in the morning, his employer woke them up and told
them they were going somewhere to purchase goats to be butchered and cooked for
the wedding feast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hermogenes del Rosario's son, Romeo, was getting married on January
6, 1979.  He became acquainted with
Romeo del Rosario when they were both still in the military service, and when
his term with the military ended, Romeo invited him to their place.  Hermogenes del Rosario had some passenger
buses and Simon started as a temporary bus conductor.  He became close to Romeo and was privy even to the secret
marriage of Romeo to a ‘balikbayan,’ which marriage was held in U.P. Balara in
Quezon City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Simon narrated that with Hermogenes del Rosario, they bought seven
(7) goats in Quezon Boulevard.  On
returning to the house of the Del Rosario's, he helped in butchering the
goats.  And though he regarded himself
as a very close friend of Romeo, he stayed in the house when the marriage took
place in the chapel Fort Bonifacio.  On
March 26, 1979, he sought and obtained the permission of his employer to take a
vacation and visit his parents in San Jose City, Nueva Ecija.  He wanted to be home in time for the town
fiesta; after the celebration, however, he had to stay to repair their damaged
fence.  On April 22, 1979, he was
arrested in their house at No. 238 San Roque St., Abar 1st, San Jose
City."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Being interrelated, the first, second and fifth assigned errors
shall be taken up together.  The
principal issue raised therein is one of credibility.  One of the many doctrines which has evolved from jurisprudence
and which this Court has steadily sustained in a host of cases is that
appellate courts will generally not disturb the factual findings of the trial
court considering that the latter is in a better position to decide the
question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment
and manner of testifying during the trial, unless the court has plainly
overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might
affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave full faith and credit to the testimonies of
Candida Abogado and Maximo Sanchez and their positive identification of the
accused.  In respect to Candida, it
held:<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x The eyewitness-testimony of Candida Abogado that she
saw Teofilo Simon about to enter the kitchen of their house immediately after
she heard two (2) bursts of gunfire, carrying a rifle wrapped inside a sack,
and that Simon quickly turned back and ran towards the yard when he saw her
looking at him, is, to the mind of the Court, sufficient to establish the
identification of the accused.  Candida
testified in a straightforward manner.  Her answers to the questions propounded to her were to the point,
plausible and consistent.  The Court
finds no compelling reason why it should not believe her testimony.   Nor is the claim of the defense that Candida
could not immediately after the incident make a clear and specific
identification of the person who killed the victims adequate to overturn the
weight of her testimony.  For it is a
matter of human experience that on the occasion of a very startling occurrence,
especially when it involves the life of a loved one, a witness may not, because
of the shock, readily recognize the face of the author of the offense though
such face has been known to her for a long time; and it is only after sometime,
after the mental faculties shall have calmed down, after repeated recollection
in the mind, that the picture becomes clear and a sudden realization dawns that
the malefactor she had seen had been no other than the one she did not, at the
time of the event, associate with it.  The accused has not shown any fact or circumstance from which it could
be inferred that said witness falsely testified or that she was actuated by
improper motives.  It has been held that
where no improper motive has been shown, relationship of the witness to the
victim does not render the clear and positive testimony of said witness less
worthy of credence (People vs. Vegayan, et al., L-37839, July 25, 1979)."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In respect to Maximo Sanchez, the trial court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The defense has not offered any explanation as to why Maximo
Sanchez, a simple farmer, would falsely testify against the accused.  x x x The testimony of Maximo Sanchez
narrated in a simple manner, has the earmarks of sincerity and is entitled to
full weight."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused, however, maintains that when first investigated
immediately after the incident, Candida categorically stated that she did not
recognize the assailant.  This is
incorrect.  What Candida conveyed in her
sworn statement, taken when she was investigated a day after the incident, and
which the accused marked as Exhibit "1",<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
was that while she does not know the name of the assailant, she could recognize
him if she saw him again.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"09 – T<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Nakilala mo ba kung sino ang taong
ito na papasok sa kusina ng inyong bahay ng mga sandaling iyon?</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>S<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hindi ko po siya kilala subalit
kung makikita ko po siyang muli ay makikilala ko siya</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">At the said investigation, she was shown
a picture of a man.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Without hesitation, she declared that the man in the picture is the same person
she saw in their house on the morning of 5 January 1979 who was carrying a
firearm placed inside a sack and who sprinted towards the back of their house
when he noticed her.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"13

inyong makikita ay mamumukhaan mo?</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>S<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Opo.</i><i><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused further argues that in her testimony, Candida testified
that she had known him since he was thirteen (13) years old.  If this were so, she should have mentioned
his name at the time of the investigation instead of relying on a picture to
identify him.  This contention is
fallacious.  It was not explicitly
established that Candida knew his name to be Teofilo Simon; she had not even
called him by that name.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The picture was used by the investigator not for the purpose of aiding Candida
in identifying the accused but for the purpose of either convincing himself
that Candida knew or could recognize the accused or obtaining additional
evidence to prove that she was telling the truth when she said that she could
recognize the man if she saw him again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of the accused that the "identification
through picture was engineered and planned by the investigating policeman (sic)
led by Policemen Agbannawag and Lina who had some ill-feelings against the
accused,"<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
is a sweeping accusation which finds no credible basis.  It has not been shown that Candida and
Maximo were enticed, cajoled, induced or inveigled by the policemen to falsely
impute upon the accused the commission of a grave offense.  The so-called ill-feelings allegedly arose
out of the accused's failure to give Agbannawag and Lina garand bullets, a
pistol and a carbine.  That incident
took place on 26 April 1978.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
It is too trivial a cause and too remote an occurrence to deserve any credit,
even as the story itself is simply incredible.  Accused failed to inform the court what his occupation was in 1978 and
why Agbannawag and Lina, as peace officers, would request from him firearms and
ammunition.  In the absence of any proof
that he was in a position to legally give or deliver firearms and ammunition to
peace officers, this Court sees no reason why the latter would make the
request.  If he had the firearms and
ammunition but no authority to keep or possess them, it would be most unlikely
that the peace officers, unless they were unfaithful to their sworn duties,
would deal with the accused.  No
evidence had been offered to prove that the abovenamed peace officers were
unfaithful to their public duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">No improper or ulterior motives which could cast a cloud of doubt
on the testimonies of Candida and Maximo were shown by the evidence for the
accused or suggested, even remotely, in the answers they gave on
cross-examination.  The totality of
their testimonies indicated their adherence to truth and their desire to help
the court arrive at the truth.  It is
settled that where there is no evidence, and nothing to indicate that the
principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the
presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to
full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused has not substantiated his claim of inconsistencies
obtaining in the testimonies of Candida and Maximo.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the third and fourth assigned errors, the accused wants
this Court to credit his defense of alibi.  The trial court has adequately disposed of this issue and We are in full
accord with its findings and conclusion, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It is well-settled that in order than an alibi as a defense
may prosper, the evidence to support it must be clear and convincing as to
preclude the possibility of the accused's presence at the scene of the crime,
while the evidence as to his identification must be weak and insufficient
(People vs Casillar, L-28132, November 25, 1969, 30 SCRA 353; People vs
Alcantara, L-26867, June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA 813).  And that alibi, in order to be given full faith and credit, must
be clearly established and must not leave any room for doubt as to its
plausibility and verity (People vs Segario, L-18659, June 29, 1965; People vs
Basilan, L-18770, July 30, 1965; People vs Dayday, L-20806-07, August 14,
1965).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Does the alibi set up by accused Simon meet the foregoing
yardstick?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused Simon testified that when the passenger bus in which he was
a conductor returned to the garage situated in Palimbo, Fort Bonifacio, Metro
Manila, it was about 11:00 to 11:30 o'clock in the evening of January 4,
1979.  After turning over the money
earnings to his employer, accused Simon went to their sleeping quarters.  He had a brief conversation with his fellow
workers.  He slept between midnight and
12:30 o'clock in the morning of the following day, January 5, 1979.  He could leave the quarters and slip
away.  Teofilo Simon declared, thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, this sleeping
quarter where you went to sleep on the night of January 4, 1979, you could
easily leave that if you want to get out, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (p. 21, t.s.n.,
hearing of February 13, 1981; Villarin).’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to the accused's claim that his
employer roused him from sleep at around 5:00 to 5:30 o'clock in the morning
(p. 10, t.s.n., hearing of February 13, 1981; Villarin), Hermogenes del Rosario
testified on direct examination that he woke up Simon around 6:00 o'clock or
7:00 o'clock in the morning (p. 7, hearing of January 12, 1981; Villarin).  In short, the defendant's employer,
Hermogenes del Rosario, was not certain about the time.  Dennis Bataycan, driver of the bus,
testified for the defense and substantially corroborated the allegation of the
accused.  He admitted on
cross-examination that when he drove the passenger bus back to the garage at around
11:00 o'clock in the evening of January 4, 1979, he was very tired because the
driver who was to relieve him did not arrive.  When he fell asleep, he went into a deep slumber (pp. 7-8, t.s.n.,
session of February 12, 1981; Villarin).  It is thus possible that Simon could have slipped away at early dawn and
come back in the morning without being detected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court accepts the defense counsel's estimate that the distance
from the sleeping quarters of the accused in Fort Bonifacio, Metro Manila, to
the situs of the shooting in Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, is around 130 kilometers
(Please see page five, Memorandum for the Accused).  The Court observes, too, that said distance can be negotiated in
a motor vehicle in two (2) hours, driving at moderate speed.  The time could be cut down some more if
travel is done in light traffic, especially at dawn and in the very early
morning hours.  Judicial notice is taken
of the fact that Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, can be reached by either of two (2)
principal routes of travel, to wit:  1)
by motoring along E. Delos Santos Highway to the North Diversion Road down to
Dau, Pampanga, then up to Tarlac, Tarlac, thence to La Paz, Tarlac, then to
Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija, and finally to Aliaga; or 2) by driving along Epifanio
de los Santos Highway to the North Diversion Road down to the Sta. Rita
Exchange, thence through Plaridel, Baliwag up to San Miguel, Bulacan, to Gapan,
San Leonardo, Sta. Rosa, Cabanatuan City and up to Aliaga, all in Nueva
Ecija.  An assassin in a motor vehicle
could, therefore, leave his quarters before 3:00 o'clock in the morning and be
in Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, at around 5:00 o'clock in the morning, take an hour or
less to escape from the scene of the crime, and drive back to his quarters at
around 8:00 o'clock in the morning, without being noticed.  In fine, the evidence to support the alibi
is not clear and convincing as to preclude the possibility of the defendant’s
presence at the scene of the crime (People vs Lumantas, L-28355, July 17, 1969;
People vs Ali, L-18519, October 30, 1969; People vs Managan, L-32733, September
11, 1974)."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As with the trial court, this Court is
likewise convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt that the accused was
sufficiently identified. </p>

<p class="BODY">We are, however, unable to agree with the conclusion of the trial
court that treachery attended the killing of the victims Hilario Abogado and
Juan Salazar; hence, accused is only liable for two (2) separate crimes of
homicide.  The information alleges
evident premeditation and treachery as qualifying circumstances.  The trial court correctly ruled that the
first was not proven by the prosecution.  Its conclusion on treachery, as earlier adverted to, is nothing more
than speculation or conjecture.  Nobody
saw the relative positions of the victims in respect to the accused immediately
before and at the time of the shooting.  Nobody testified as to what exactly happened immediately before and
during the incident, or how the initial attack was commenced and how it
developed until the victims were killed.  The rule is settled that treachery cannot be presumed; it must be proved
by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
