the Manila JDRC where, in the early stages of his appearance, he always signed
the minutes as "Atty. Emmanuel R. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>",

<p class="BODY">There is no violation of the Civil Service rules and regulations
for his appearance as counsel for the defen­dant in the JDRC Case No. E-01978
was with authority given by the Associate Commissioner of SEC, Julio A. <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court also holds that under the facts complained of
supported by the annexes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>the
answer of respondent, likewise sustained by annexes attached thereto and the
reply of the complainant, the accusation that respondent with malice and
deliberate intent to evade the laws, assumed a different name, falsified his
identity and represented himself to be one "ATTY. MANUEL SISON" with
offices at No. 605 EDSA, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City at the times that he will handle private cases, is not meritorious.
Neither is the charge substantiated. The only case referred to is that pending
the JDRC, Case No. E-01978 wherein respondent appeared as counsel for the
defendant. It being an isolated case, the same does not constitute the practice
of law, more so since respondent did not derive any pecuniary gain for his
appear­ance because respondent and defendant therein were close family friends.
Such act of the respondent in going out of his way to aid as counsel to a close
family friend should not be allowed to be used as an instrument of <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span> against respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in Zeta vs. <span class="SpellE">Malinao</span> (87 SCRA
303) wherein the respondent was dismissed from the service because being a
government employee, he appeared as counsel in a private case, cannot be
applied in the case at bar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">because the respondent in said </span><u>Zeta</u> case had appeared as
counsel without permission from his superiors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the complaint alleges violation of civil service rules,
the complainant however states that the basis of his complaint for disbarment
is not the respon­dent's act of appearing as counsel but the unauthorized use
of another <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">name.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the records however, reveals that whereas there is
indeed a pleading entitled "Objection/Opposition to the Formal Offer of
Evidence" (Annex "C" to the Complaint for Disbarment, which is
signed as "Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>", counsel for
defendant, 605 EDSA, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, p. 7 of the Records), there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is, </span>however, no showing that respondent was
thus motivated with bad faith or malice, for otherwise, he would not have
corrected the spelling of his name when the court staff <span class="SpellE">mis</span>-spelled
it in one of the minutes of the proceeding. Moreover, We find no reason or
motive for respondent to conceal his true name when he has already been given
express authority by his superior to act as counsel for Juan <span class="SpellE">Sacquing</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>the latter's case pending before the JDRC. And <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">while it </span>may
be true that subsequent errors were made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in sending </span>notices to him under the name
"Atty. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>," the errors were
attributable to the JDRC clerical staff and not to the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">At most, this Court would only counsel the respondent to be more
careful and cautious in signing his name so as to avoid unnecessary confusion
as regards his identity.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, We are constrained to examine the motives that
prompted the complainant in filing the present case. An examination of the
records reveals that the com­plainant was a defendant in the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Case No. 1982 filed by the Integrated Livestock
Dealers Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Teofisto</span> Jiao against seven (7)
respondents including the complainant, seeking to oust the complainant and his
co-defendants from acting as officers of the Integrated Livestock Dealers Inc.,
then pending before respondent as Hearing Officer of the SEC, who after trial
decided the case against the herein complainant. From this antecedent fact,
there is cast a grave and serious doubt as to the true motivation of the
complainant in filing the present case, considering further that other adminis­trative
charges were filed by the complainant against res­pondent herein before the
SEC, JDRC, and the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office in Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that complainant's repeated charges or accu­sations only
indicate his resentment and bitterness in losing the SEC case and not with the
honest and sincere desire and objectives "(1) to compel the attorney to
deal fairly and honestly with his client;" (Strong vs. <span class="SpellE">Munday</span>,
52 N.J. <span class="SpellE">Eq</span>. 833, 21 A. 611) and "(2) to remove
from the profession a person whose misconduct has proved him unfit to be
entrusted with the duties and responsibilities be­longing to the office of an
attorney." (Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> <span class="SpellE">Brounsal</span>,

Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 6, p. 242).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, We find no reason or necessity to
refer this complaint to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and
recommendation.</p>

Comment of Complainant, last paragraph, p. 3, which reads: "Respondent
evaded the issue in his Answer; he is not charged for practicing his profession
nor for collecting fees <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; neither is he
charged for appearing <u>sans</u> office authority to do so. Respondent is
charged for malpractice in representing himself as. Atty. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, which is not his real name before the Manila
Juvenile and Domestic Rela­tions Court and in signing and submitting pleadings
under this assumed name, in violation of the law. What makes this matter worse
is that Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> is not a member of the Bar (Attorney)."</p>
