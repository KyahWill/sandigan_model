of the Regional Trial Court, Tandag, Surigao del Sur, Branch 27, dated 12 July
1988, rendered in Criminal Case No. 1326, finding the accused Diosdado Avila
and Agapito Agrabio, herein <span style="">appellants,
guilty of the crime of murder, but acquitting accused Aurelio Silvoza.  However, after </span>the trial court had
forwarded to this Court the records of the case, by reason of the appeal
interposed by the appellants, said court, on 1 August <span style="">1988, </span>amended its decision of 12 July 1988 and submitted to this
Court said amended decision which found accused Avila and Agrabio guilty of
rebellion, not murder.  The People
interposed objection to the rendition of the amended decision at a time when
the trial court had lost jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that on 23 October 1985, the victim Gregorio P.
Murillo, then governor of the province of Surigao del Sur, was shot dead
allegedly by Diosdado Avila, Agapito Agrabio and Aurelio Silvoza.  An information for murder was filed against
the above-named accused, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about 5:30 o'clock in the morning on October 23,
1985 at the National Highway, municipality of Tandag, province of Surigao del
Sur, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, Diosdado Avila, Agapito Agrabio and Aurelio Silvoza,
conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, without
provocation, with treachery, evident premeditation and with delibe­rate intent
to kill, armed with an unlicensed .45 Caliber Pistol and with the use thereof,
did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloneously shoot Governor
Gregorio P. Murillo, Provincial Governor of Surigao del Sur, thereby hitting
and inflicting upon the latter a gunshot wound on his head, x x x.<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the three (3) accused pleaded not guilty to the
crime charged.  The only issue which the
trial court found necessary to resolve was whether or not the shooting and
resultant killing <span style="">of </span>the victim
by the accused, were done in furtherance of rebellion or of <span style="">their </span>intention to overthrow or help
overthrow the duly constituted government.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 12 July 1988, after hearing the evidence of the prosecution
and the defense, the trial court rendered its decision finding, as already
adverted to, the two (2) accused, Diosdado Avila and Agapito Agrabio, guilty of
the crime charged (murder) and sentencing them to life imprison­ment, while the
third accused, Aurelio Silvoza, was absolved from any criminal liability.  The dispositive portion of the decision
reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding accused Diosdado Avila and Agapito Agrabio
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as principals, the court
sentences both of them to life imprisonment, to be served by them at the
National Penitentiary, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, with costs againt them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They are hereby ordered to pay the heirs of the late Governor
Gregorio P. Murillo the sum of P6,000.00 for the marble tomb of the deceased;
P10,000.00 for the expenses in the solution of this crime; P30,000.00 for life
indemnity; <span style="">P50,000.00 for actual
damages; P25,000.00 for moral damages and P10,000.00 for exemplary damages,
without subsidiary imprisonment in </span>case <span style="">of insolvency.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused Aurelio Silvoza is hereby absolved from any criminal
liability."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused Avila and Agapito timely filed their appeal from said
decision.  On 3 August 1988, the trial
court forwarded (posted) to this Court the records of the case including its
decision of 12 July 1988 which were received by the Supreme Court on 26 August
1988.  However, the records also show
that the trial court issued another deci­sion which is dated 1 August 1988 but
forwarded (posted) to the Supreme Court on 15 August 1988 and received by the
Supreme Court on 15 September 1988.  Its
second decision <u>amended</u> its earlier decision of 12 July 1988, ruling
this time that Avila and Agrabio are guilty of rebellion, not murder.  The dispositive portion of the amended
decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the accused Diosdado Avila and Agapito
Agrabio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rebellion, the court sentences them
to suffer the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period and a fine of
not to exceed P20,000.00 or an imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1)
day to twenty (20) years and an additional imprisonment in case of insolvency
to be served by them in the National Penitentiary, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused Aurelio Silvoza is hereby absolved from any criminal
liability."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be observed that the "amended decision",
although dated 1 August 1988, was promulgated only <u>after</u> the appellants
had timely appealed from the earlier decision of 12 July 1988 and <u><span style="">after</span></u><span style=""> </span>the trial court had forwarded to the Supreme Court the records
of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court provides that a
"judgment of conviction may, upon motion of the accused, be modified or
set aside by the court rendering it before the judgment has become final or
appeal has been perfected".  It is
thus clear that at the time the trial court rendered the "amended
decision", said court had already lost its jurisdiction over the case, the
appeal having been earlier perfected.  Hence, the "amended decision" has no legal force and effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question then that it is the decision of 12 July 1988
convicting the appellants of the crime of murder and sentencing them to the
penalty of life imprisonment, which is the subject of the present review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main if not the sole question in the appeal at bar is whether
the trial court correctly convicted appellants of the crime of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon careful consideration of the facts and circum­stances
surrounding the case, <span style="">as </span>well as
the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense, the Court, in the
exercise of its power to review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the appealed decision dated 12 July 1988, holds that appellants Avila and
Agrabio <span style="">are </span>guilty of the crime
of rebellion, not murder.  Hence, we
find merit in their appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> of
the case show that:</p>

<blockquote>At about 5:30 in the morning of 23 October 1985 along the national
highway of Tandag, Surigao del Sur, while the victim was inside his car seated
beside the driver, whereas Mrs. Murillo (wife of the Governor) was seated
behind, appellant Avila shot Governor Murillo at the head, using a .45 caliber
pistol, resulting to the Governor's death.  His only companion then was appellant Agrabio.  Aurelio Silvoza (the other co-accused) was not present at the
time the crime was committed as he was at the hinterland resting because he was
then sick.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After the shooting, the two appellants - Avila and Agrabio ran away.  On 17 February 1987 Agrabio was apprehended
whereas Avila and Silvoza were captured on 18 February 1987 by the members of
the Philippine Constabulary.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the trial of the case, it was the contention of the
defense that appellants committed rebellion, not murder, the shooting and
killing of the late Governor Murillo being <span style="">a </span>means to or in furtherance of rebellion or in pursuance of the
objectives of the rebels.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, notwithstanding the aforesaid claim of the defense, the
trial court in its decision, dated 12 July 1988, found appellants Avila and Agrabio
guilty of the crime of murder (accused Silvoza was acquitted).  It ruled that the crime committed could not
be rebellion because there was no evidence presented showing that at the time
Governor Murillo was fatally shot, an uprising or rebellion was on-going, where
the rebels and the armed forces of the government were actually fighting or
locked in combat.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the evidence show that appellants Avila and Agrabio were on a
mission to kill and, in fact, they killed Governor Murillo on that fateful day
of 23 October 1985.  The evidence also
disclose that at the time they killed the Governor, they were members of the
liquidating squad of the New People's Army (NPA), and that they killed the
Governor upon the orders of their senior officer in the NPA, one Commander
Celo.  According to them, they were
ordered to "liquidate" the Governor because of the latter's
"corruption" in not giving on time the salaries of the employees in
the provincial government, and that, instead, he gave the salaries first to the
military whom he maintained as his personal bodyguards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing of Governor Murillo by the appellants Avila (alias
Commander Efren); and Agrabio (alias Commander Raymund) who were at the time
admittedly and undisputably members of the liquidating squad of the NPA,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
upon the orders of NPA Commander Celo, appears therefore to be politically
motivated and tainted.  Hence, this
Court is of the view that the appellants committed the crime of simple
rebellion, not murder, punishable under Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised
Penal Code ("RPC" for brevity) consistent with the ruling in <u>People
vs. Manglallan</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
which held that:</p>

<blockquote>"The appellant admits that he was a member of the NPA then
operating in the Cagayan Area with Ka Daniel as their leader.  He asserts that the NPA is the military arm
of the Communist Party of the Philippines.  There is no question likewise that the killing of Apolonio Ragual by the
appellant and his companions who were also members of the NPA upon the orders
of Ka Daniel was politically <span style="">motivated.  They suspected Ragual </span>as an <span style="">informer of the PC.  In fact, after he was killed, they left a letter and a drawing on
the body of Ragual as a warning to others not to follow his example.  x x x The Court, therefore, sustains the
contention of the appellant that the crime he committed </span>is <span style="">not murder but the crime of rebellion
punishable under Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the crime of rebellion and the penalty imposable
therefor, Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code have been amended
several times by a number of presiden<span style="">tial
decrees and Executive Order </span>No. <span style="">187</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and Republic Act </span>No. <span style="">6968.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the time the crime was committed in the case at bar (i.e., 23 October
1985), the presidential decree in force and effect was P.D. 1834 which amended
Article 135 of the RPC, by imposing a penalty of reclusion perpetua to death
for those found guilty of rebellion.  Felonies being generally punishable under the laws in force at the time
of their commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> the
imposable penalty, therefore, in the present case is that provided by P.D.
1834.  Said Article 135, as amended by
P.D. 1834, refers to two (2) groups of persons who may commit rebellion -- the <u>first</u>
<u><span style="">group</span></u><span style=""> </span>(referred to in paragraph one of
Article 135) are those who promote, maintain, or head a rebellion, or who,
while holding any public office or employment, take part therein, engaging in
war against the forces of the government, destroying property or committing serious
violence, exacting contributions or diverting public funds from the lawful
purpose for which they have been appropriated; the <u><span style="">second</span></u><span style=""> <u>group</u> </span>(referred
to in paragraph two thereof) are those who merely participate in or execute the
commands of others in <span style="">a </span>rebellion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant appeal, while we find the appellants guilty of
rebellion, we also find that their case falls under the "second
group" referred to in paragraph two (2) of Article 135, the evidence
having shown that they belonged to the liquidating squad of the NPA, tasked to
operate in Tandag, and that they killed the victim, Governor Murillo, in
compliance with the orders of their senior officer, one Commander Celo of the
NPA.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, as far as the penalty imposed is concerned, it would
seem immaterial whether the offender falls under the first or second group, for
under Article 135, RPC as amended by P.D. 1834, <span style="">a </span>uniform penalty of reclusion perpetua to death is imposed for
the "first group" or "second group" of rebellion.</p>

<p class="BODY">But we take note that pending the present appeal, R.A. 6968 was
enacted and is now in full force, which provides for the penalty of reclusion
perpetua for offenders belonging to the "first group", and reclusion
temporal only for those falling under the "second group" of rebellion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
penal laws are given retroactive effect insofar as they are favorable to the
offender.  Considering that a
retroactive effect of RA 6968 to the present appeal would be more favorable to
the appellants as said Act imposes <span style="">a </span>penalty
of reclusion temporal, not reclusion perpetua as in P.D. 1834, for offenders
belonging to the "second group" of rebels, the Court shall therefore
impose the penalty provided for in Article 135 of the RPC, as amended by RA 6968,
which is reclusion temporal.  There
being neither an aggravating nor mitigating circumstance attending the
commission of the offense, the proper penalty is reclusion temporal in its
medium period, applying rule no. 1 set forth in Article 64 of the RPC.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The range of the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period is from
fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years
and four (4) months.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the award of damages adjudged by the trial court, this
Court grants to the heirs of the late Governor an indemnity in the amount of
P50,000.00, but the other items for damages granted in the appealed decision
are set aside for they are not proper in rebellion cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Court notes with deep concern the trial judge's attempt
to amend his earlier decision of 12 July 1988, after the lapse of 20 days (the
amended decision being dated 1 August 1988), totally disregarding the basic
doctrine that courts lose jurisdiction over cases after an appeal shall have
been perfected therein.  This doctrine
is too elementary <span style="">as </span>to have
been ignored by the trial judge.  Whatever may be the reasons behind the intriguing change in the
respondent judge in rendering his amended decision, the Court strictly
admonishes him to be more cautious, circums­pect and yet decisive in the
exercise of his judicial functions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<b> </b>the appealed decision of the Regional
Trial Court of Tandag, Surigao del Sur, Branch 27 <u>dated</u> <u>12</u> <u>July</u>
<u>1988</u> rendered in Criminal Case No. 1326 is hereby MODIFIED, by convicting
the accused-appellants, Diosdado Avila and Agapito Agrabio of the crime of
rebellion punish­able under Article 135, paragraph no. 2 of the Revised Penal
Code as amended by Republic Act No. 6968, (and not murder), and hereby
sentencing them to suffer imprisonment of fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months
