				<H3>PRIMO SAN PEDRO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. FLOR F. RESURRECCION, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF MALOLOS, BULACAN, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GUERRERO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an administrative complaint filed by complainant, Primo San Pedro, 
against respondent Provincial Sheriff, Atty. Flor F. Resurreccion of Malolos, 
Bulacan, for alleged "neglect of duty". 
<p>The records disclose that complainant on November 4, 1974 filed Civil Case 
No. 4558-M with the CFI of Bulacan, and correspondingly paid the sheriff's fees 
under Official Receipt Nos. 9094375, 9094376, and 9094377. Despite payment of 
the requisite sheriff's fees and corresponding summons having been issued to the 
defendant, the same was not served by the office of the Provincial Sheriff up to 
the filing of this administrative complaint on December 20, 1974. 
</p><p>In his comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> respondent sheriff 
claims that the neglect of duty for not serving the summons was not his fault 
but the fault of Deputy Sheriff Renato Valerio, who was assigned to serve the 
summons to the defendant. He alleges that Mr. Valerio left the country for 
Canada in 1975 without obtaining clearance from his office and without making 
the necessary turnover of the pertinent court processes under his (Valerio) 
custody and responsibility including the summons issued in Civil Case No. 
4558-M. 
</p><p>Executive Judge Roque Tamayo of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan to 
whom this case was referred for investigation, report and recommendation, 
scheduled twice a formal investigation. On those two occasions, complainant 
Primo San Pedro failed to appear despite due notice. Thus, the Executive Judge 
recommended dismissal of the complaint in view of complainant's lack of interest 
to prosecute his case. 
</p><p>The fact that complainant had lost interest in prosecuting the case does not 
warrant the dismissal of the instant case. The records alone provide a 
sufficient basis for the determination of respondent's administrative liability. 

</p><p>The tenor of respondentâ€™s comment is to impress this Court that since a 
deputy sheriff was assigned to serve the summons in Civil Case No. 4558-M, he is 
no longer responsible for the acts of his deputy. 
</p><p>Respondent Sheriff is in error. The duty to serve writs, execute all 
processes and carry into effect all orders issuing from the court is primarily 
assigned to the sheriffs. While this duty may be delegated by the sheriffs to 
their deputies, sheriffs are not relieved of responsibility from their duty to 
execute and serve promptly writs and other court processes. Hence, despite due 
delegation or assignment thereof, sheriffs still retain their responsibility and 
are duty-bound to supervise and see to it that these court processes are served 
and returned to the issuing court with reasonable celerity and promptness. In 
the instant case, if respondent sheriff was not negligent of his duty to 
exercise close and strict supervision over his deputy, the failure of the 
service of summons could have been avoided. 
</p><p>Besides, this Court is not unmindful that the same respondent, Flor 
Resurreccion, was already admonished in a previous resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> "to exercise a closer and stricter 
supervision over the process-servers under him so as to avoid a repetition of 
delayed returns of service." Notwithstanding this previous admonition, 
respondent was again remiss in the performance of his official function which 
interferred with, impeded, or obstructed the processes of the Court resulting in 
a setback in the administration of justice. 
</p><p><b>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,</b> respondent Provincial Sheriff 
Flor F. Resurreccion is hereby suspended for a period of one (1) month without 
pay, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be 
dealt with more severely. </p><b>SO ORDERED.</b> <br>Teehankee, Acting C.J., 
(Chairman), Makasiar, Fernandez, Melencio-Herrera, and Plana, JJ., concur.
