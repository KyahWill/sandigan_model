<p class="BODY">The facts of this case as found by the Court of Appeals are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>
died intestate on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1966</st1:date>,

registered land of 77 square meters in <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span>,
Laguna, with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>house erected
thereon, valued at P7,500.00, (the "PROPERTY", for short).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, each of the five minor plaintiffs had
inherited a 1/12 share of the P7,500.00, or P625.00 each, which is less than
the P2,000.00 mentioned in Article 320 of the Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date>,
the surviving widow, in her own behalf and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>, was able to obtain guardianship over the
persons and properties of the minor plaintiffs, without personal notice to
their mother, who was alleged "could not be located <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the efforts exerted" (ROA, p. 26).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On July 23, 1970, their guardian caused the minor plaintiffs
to file a complaint in the case below for the annulment of the sale of their
participation in the PROPERTY to defendants-appellants and, conceding the
validity of the sale of the widow's participation in the PROPERTY, they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">asked </span>that, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">as </span>co-owners, they be allowed to exercise the right of legal

follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">'(1) Was the sale of
the shares of the plaintiffs in the ownership of the land in question which was

<blockquote>"The lower court, invoking the <span class="SpellE">Nario</span>
case (<span class="SpellE">Nario</span> vs. Philippine American Life Insurance
Co., 20 SCRA 434), promulgated the appealed judgment annulling the sale to
defendants-appellants of the minor plaintiffs' participation in the PROPERTY,

<p class="BODY">The Statutory provision involved in the first error assigned is
Article 1623 of the New Civil Code, which is hereunder reproduced, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1623.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right
of legal pre-emption or redemption shall not be exercised except within thirty
days from the notice in writing by the prospective vendor, or by the vendor, as
the case may be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deed of sale shall
not be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">recorded in the Registry of

written notice thereof to all possible <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The right of redemption of co-owners excludes that of
adjoining owners."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under their first assignment of error, the appellants advance the
view that "the requisite notice in writing provided for by Article 1623 of
the New Civil Code was already received by the minors-plaintiffs thru their
then legal guardian, Clarita <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>, their mother, on the date the deed of
extra-judicial partition and sale was executed on <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the thirty-day period of redemption must be reckoned from this
date."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated differently, under Article 320 of the New Civil Code, the right granted
to Clarita <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>
to administer her children's property if the same is less than P2,000.00
includes the right to receive for her minor children such notice in
writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she received her copy of
the Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>,
Clarita <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span> in
effect received a notice in writing of the said sale in behalf of her minor
children.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Articles 320 and 326 of the New Civil Code state that:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 320.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The father,
or in his absence the mother, is the legal administrator of the property
pertaining to the child under parental authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the property is worth more than two
thousand pesos, the father or mother shall give a bond subject to the approval
of the Court of First Instance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 326.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
property of the child is worth more than two thousand pesos, the father or
mother shall be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>guardian
of the child's property, subject to the duties and obligations of guardians
under the Rules of Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In other words, the father, or in his
absence the mother, is considered the legal administrator of the property
pertaining to his child under parental authority without need of giving a bond
in case the amount of his child's property does not exceed Two Thousand Pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 93, Section 7, of the Revised Rules of Court goes further by
automatically designating the parent as the legal guardian of the child without
need of any judicial appointment in case the latter's property does not exceed
Two Thousand Pesos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It reads, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parents as
guardians.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- When the property of the
child under parental authority is worth two thousand pesos or less, the father
or the mother, without the necessity of court appointment, shall be his legal
guardian.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the property of the child
is worth more than two thousand pesos, the father or the mother shall be
considered guardian of the child's property, with the duties and obligations of
guardians under these rules, and shall file the petition required by section 2
hereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For good reasons the court may,
however, appoint another suitable person."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Our standing jurisprudence reveals that there is a case which is
applicable to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This case
involved an interpretation of Article 1524 of the Old Civil Code, the statutory
provision from which Article 1623 of the New Civil Code originated and the one
which the latter amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two
articles are basically the same except that Article 1623 mandates a longer
period for redemption and limits the manner of transmitting the notice of the
sale of the property co-owned to one in writing served by the vendor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is <span class="SpellE"><u>Villasor</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Medel</span>, et al.</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the co-owner plaintiff, upon reaching the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">age </span>of majority, sought to redeem <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>portion of a large tract of land

the plaintiff reached the age </span>of majority, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This Court ruled in favor
of the defendant, holding </span>that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"The law in
prescribing certain </span>contingencies as the starting point from which the
nine-day period should be counted, is to be presumed to exclude all
others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Exclusio</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span> <span class="SpellE">alterius</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The
starting point is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">registration </span>or,
in the absence of registration, knowledge of the conveyance by the co-owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is logical to assume that if minority had
been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contemplated, the law would have
so expressly stated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is specially </span>true
in a code which, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unlike an ordinary
statute, is framed with meticulous care and </span>thorough reflection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The role of minors in cases of legal
redemption is too conspicuous and perceptible to have been overlooked in the
framing of article 1524.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The onerous
position of the purchaser and considerations of public interest, we believe,
forbade liberality as to time in favor of <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span>;
hence the limitation of the causes of extension to those factors (actual or
constructive notice) without which the exercise of the right of redemption
would not be possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The shortness of
the period fixed in the above article is itself a safe index, in our opinion,
of its peremptoriness and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">inflexibility."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

guardian not only could have repurchased those lots for the plaintiff within

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In the decision, this Court frowned
against a liberal interpretation of the <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
provision prescribing the period for legal redemption, hence, the following
disquisition, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>xxx legal redemption is in the nature of a mere privilege created
by law partly for reasons of public policy and partly for the benefit and
convenience of the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, to afford him a way
out of what might <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">be a </span>disagreeable
or inconvenient association into which he has been thrust."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx The right of legal redemption is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">a </span>pure creature of the law regulated by law, and works only one
way - in favor of the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not having parted with anything, the legal <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> can compel the purchaser to sell but can not
be compelled to buy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We do not believe that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">framers </span>of the Civil Code ever intended to countenance a
situation so unjust to one of the parties and prejudicial to social
interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The construction of article
1524 which the plaintiff offers would keep the property in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>state of <span class="SpellE">indivision</span>
even if one of the co-owners wanted to separate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is contrary to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">express </span>policy of the law that 'No
co-owner shall be obliged to remain a party to the community, but each may, at
any time, demand partition of the thing held in common.' (Article 400, Civil
Code.) It would be extremely unfair to the purchaser and injurious to the
public welfare to keep in a state of suspense, for <span class="SpellE">possibily</span>
as long as 20 years or more, what his co-owner might do when he becomes of
age.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the uncertainty continued the
purchaser could not make any improvement on the property without running the
risk of losing his investments and the fruits of his labor."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The wisdom that can easily be formulated in reconciling the laws
and the case discussed above is that the period fixed for legal redemption in
accordance with Article 1623 (then Article 1524) of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">New Civil Code will run against </span>a minor co-owner duly
represented by a judicially appointed guardian, provided that said guardian <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is served with the </span>necessary written
notice by the vendor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Corollary to this,
the period fixed for legal redemption will also run against a minor co-owner
whose property is valued no more than Two Thousand Pesos and who is merely
represented by his father or mother with no judicial appointment as a guardian
because according to Rule 93, Section 7, of the Revised Rules of Court, the
parent in this situation is automatically the child's legal guardian.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the parent-guardian must first be
served with a notice in writing of the sale of an undivided portion of the
property by the vendor in order that the period for redemption may begin to
accrue.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the value of the property of each <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appellee</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>minor does not exceed Two Thousand
Pesos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals found that

Therefore, after the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">minors' father
died, their mother, Clarita <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>, automatically became their legal guardian.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, she acquired the plenary powers of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the document evidencing the transfer of the property in question to the
appellants, she also in effect received the notice in writing required by
Article 1623 in behalf of her children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This manner of receiving a written notice is specifically sanctioned by

Thus, in this case, the period of redemption began to toll from the time of
that receipt.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the judicial guardian of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> minors, <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>, was only appointed as such on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She thereafter manifested her desire to

complaint that was finally filed for this case on <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the required written notice was served on <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date> and the offer to
redeem was only made after <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="11">November

the appellants cannot now be ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that portion of the undivided property
which originally belonged to Clarita <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second assignment of error, the appellants contend that
the Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:23.0pt">i</span>n so far as it sold to them the
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> minors' share of 5/12, is a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> contract pursuant to Article 1390 of the New Civil
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They then quoted verbatim the text
of the said article without identifying the particular portion of that
provision which directly supports their contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the appellants, in case a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>
contract is annulled, Article 1398 requires the restitution by the contracting
parties to each other of the things received by them under the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants, however, concede that by
express mandate of Article 1399, full restitution cannot be ordered from the
minors involved in the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
minors can only be required to restore partially, only to the extent of the
benefits they received by virtue of the questioned contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>
is not a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> or an annullable contract under
Article 1390 of the New Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Article 1390 renders a contract <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> if
one of the parties is incapable of giving consent to the contract or if the
contracting party's consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation,
undue influence or fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case,
however, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> minors are not even parties to
the contract involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their names were
merely dragged into the contract by their mother who claimed a right to
represent them, purportedly in accordance with Article 320 of the New Civil
Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>
is an unenforceable or, more specifically, an unauthorized contract under
Articles 1403(1) and 1317 of the New Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These provisions state that:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1403.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
following contracts are unenforceable, unless they are ratified:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1) Those
entered into in the name of another person by one who has been given no
authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his powers;
xxx"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 1317.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No one may contract
in the name of another without being authorized by the latter, or unless he has
by law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>right to represent him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A contract entered into in the name of another by one who has
no authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his powers, shall
be unenforceable, unless it is ratified, expressly or impliedly, by the person
on whose behalf it has been executed, before it is revoked by the other
contracting party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, Clarita <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span> has no authority or has acted beyond her powers in
conveying to the appellants that 5/12 undivided share of her minor children in
the property involved in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
powers given to her by the laws as the natural guardian covers only matters of
administra­tion<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> minors never ratified this

them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the contract remained
unenforceable or unauthorized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
restitution may be ordered from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> minors
either as to that portion of the purchase price which pertains to their share
in the property or at least as to that portion which benefited them because the
law does not sanction any.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third error assigned need not be discussed further because
Our pronouncement on the first assignment of error has rendered it
academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state that since
the 30-day period for redemption had already lapsed, the appellants cannot be
ordered to re-sell to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> the remaining
7/12 portion of the property in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the appellants are hereby ordered to
restore to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> the full ownership and
possession of the latter's 5/12 share in the undivided property by executing
the proper deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants' ownership over the remaining
