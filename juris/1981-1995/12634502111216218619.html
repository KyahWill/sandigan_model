Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their appointments, however,
were not submitted to the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
for approval as required by Sec. 2081 of the Revised Administrative Code, the
pertinent portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

approval."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In 1967 the attention of
Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> was called to the necessity of
complying with the provisions of the Revised Adminis</span>trative Code
above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in January,
1968, he sub<span style="">mitted his appointments to
the Provincial Board but said board oh </span><st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="1"><span style="">January 19, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, disapproved most of them including those of
the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they worked only
up to </span><st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="1"><span style="">January 31, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that they have acquired a permanent status
because of the attestation of their appointments by the Civil Service
Commission and length of service, and that they were removed because they were
type "O" or <span class="SpellE">Osmeñistas</span> whereas the newly
elected officials who took office in January, 1968, were political
enemies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, they filed a
petition in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to
compel their reinstatement and payment of their back salaries or damages for
those who are no longer interested in reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals
dismissed their petition as aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question in this case is whether or not petitioners are
clearly entitled to the remedy of <i>mandamus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence to show that the petitioners were removed
from their positions because they were <span class="SpellE">Osmeñistas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the fact is that the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> disapproved their appointments pursuant to the power
granted to it by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, their
appointments ceased to have effect, if at all, and their services were properly
terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It matters not that the appointments
of the petitioners had been attested by the Commissioner of Civil Service and
that they had served for several years because the appointments having been
made without the approval of the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
they were not valid appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Valdez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> vs. Gutierrez, No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-25819, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 22, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 23 SCRA 661.)</span></p>
