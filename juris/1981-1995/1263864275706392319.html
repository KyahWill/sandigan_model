</span>(a) all the respondents with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and
misconduct, and (b) Orlando A. <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> with
malpractice, and asks for their disbarment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Miranda alleges on December 26, 1985, that Orlando <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> sold him a piece of land for P250,000.00, of which
consideration he paid the initial amount of P150,000.00, with the understanding
that he would assume the seller's mortgage debt of P100,000.00 with the
Philippine Savings<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bank.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He paid the first three amortizations in the total amount of P87<span class="GramE">,864.94</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
but when he tendered his payment for the fourth and last amortization on
December 23, 1986, the other respondents, who are all officers and employees of
the PSB, rejected his payment, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">informing
</span>him that <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> had already paid the said
amortization and that, as the mortgagor, he was entitled to the delivery of the
title to the mortgaged property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides this contract, Miranda and <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>
had entered into an agreement on <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1986</st1:date>, under which the latter undertook to represent the former
in his complaint against the Manila Banking Corporation for unilaterally
increasing the interest on his loan from 24% to 52%.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>stipulated that 70% of whatever damages
the complainant could recover would be to his account, with the other 30% going
to <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>contingent fee.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

In the end, a compromise was reached with the defendant bank and the
complainant's loan of P110<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was considered fully
paid even as his claim for damages was also withdrawn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was embodied in a decision rendered by
the Regional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">October 23, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> charged Miranda the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,631.93</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">representing
</span>his contingent fee in this case,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
but the complainant demurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Miranda
pointed out that he had collected no damages whatsoever as the amount
considered paid consisted of the principal of his loan plus the original
interest, which was what he had insisted on in the first place.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Contending that he had negotiated the compromise agreement with <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span> and so was entitled to payment for his
professional <span class="GramE">services,</span> <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>
then sought the annotation of an attorney's lien on the title to the land
offered to secure the MBC loan.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The complainant says it was <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> who suggested that
he file the complaint against <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span> in the first
place and accuses him of "ambulance-chasing." He adds that although
he did not benefit from the suit, he paid <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> a fee
of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, which the latter accepted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming back to the loan with PSB, Miranda submits that the bank
had previously accepted his first three payments and by so doing approved his
assumption of <span class="SpellE">Rayos's</span> mortgage debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the other respondents had no right to
refuse his fourth payment and to deliver the certificate of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">title not to him but to <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>,
who no longer had any claim to the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These respondents insist, however, that the complainant had never
formally assumed the mortgage debt nor had the bank agreed to such assumption,
and that <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> had specifically asked them not to
deliver the title to the complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1987</st1:date>,
the complainant filed an action for damages against <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>
and prayed for a writ of attachment which was granted but subsequently
discharged by the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
That denial was affirmed by the Court of Appeals,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which was in turn sustained by this Court on <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1989</st1:date>, in G.R. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">No. 80030.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Miranda also filed a criminal complaint with the Provincial <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> against <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> and the other respondents for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
but this was dismissed<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and the motion for reconsideration was denied.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
On appeal to the Department of Justice, the dismissal was affirmed on <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="7">July <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">26,
 </span>1988</st1:date>, with Undersecretary Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>
III holding in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The appeal is not impressed with merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The record shows that complainant is not even sure of what kind of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was allegedly committed by respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his complaint affidavit he clearly and
categorically stated that respondents were guilty of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
with unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of
the Revised <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Penal Code (misappropriating
or converting money or goods received in trust, etc.); however, after
respondent spouses had submitted their joint counter-affidavit, complainant
filed a manifestation dated March 13, 1987 stating that he "made </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a mistake </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in pinpointing the particular mode or kind of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
committed"<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and that respondents
should be held liable for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> by false pretenses
or fraudulent acts prior to or simultaneously with </span>the commission of the
fraud under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant's claim that fraud was employed by Orlando <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> during the transaction because he withheld
information that the sale and assumption of mortgage was subject to the
approval of the PSB is untenable.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is difficult to imagine
that complainant would be so naive as to be totally </span>unaware of the
provisions of the original contract between the PSB and the spouses <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is a
degree holder (A.B. Pre-Law and B.S.C.) and Acting Municipal Treasurer of Las <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">PiÃ±as</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>In
short, he is not an ordinary layman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
a buyer with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>knowledge of law, it was unnatural for him to read the provisions of the
real estate mortgage wherein it is provided, among others, that the sale of the
property covered by the mortgage does not in any manner relieve the mortgagor
of his obligation but that "on the contrary, both the vendor and the
vendee, or the party in whose favor the alienation or encumbrance is made shall
be jointly and severally liable for said mortgage obligations." There is
every reason to believe that it was pursuant to the said provision in the real
estate mortgage that complainant tried to assume the loan obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Rayoses</span> by filling up and submitted the loan application
(page 30, records) sent by Orlando <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By signing the loan application and the
general information sheet (page 31, records) in connection with said
application, complainant showed that he knew that there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>need to
formally apply to the bank in order for him to assume the mortgage.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>We find respondent spousesâ€™ version that when complainant's application
to assume the mortgage loan was disapproved <span class="GramE">he</span> begged
that he be allowed to pay the quarterly amortization credible, owing to the
fact that complainant made the payments for the account of the <span class="SpellE">Rayoses</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
complainant knew that since his application to the PSB was not approved, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>no
substitution of parties and so he had to pay for the account of respondent
spouses as shown by the receipts issued by the PSB (page 196-197, records).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>As for the charge that <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> paid the
last installment to block complainant from getting the title and transferring
the same to his name, respondents' version is more <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">satisfactory and convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Orlando <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> paid the last
amortization when it became apparent that complainant would not be able to give
the payment on the due date as he was still trying to sell his Lancer car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if complainant was able to pay the last
installment of the mortgage loan, the title would not be released to him </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he knew very well that his application to
assume the mortgage was disapproved and he had no personality as far as PSB was
concerned.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is absurd to claim that fraud can be inferred from the mere fact
that complainant failed to get the title over the property in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As clearly shown in the records, respondent
Orlando <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> repeatedly offered to turn over to the
complainant the TCT to the property which was redeemed from the PSB upon
payment by complainant in cash of the amount paid by <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>
as fourth and final amortization plus some fees or charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The letters sent by <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>
(pages 166-167, records) show that it is not true that <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>
refused to deliver to the complainant TCT No. 100156 but was willing to hand it
over any time complainant pays him the amount representing the last
amortization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, even before the
said TCT was finally released to the respondent spouses on <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1987</st1:date>, complainant filed his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">complaint with the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January 7, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence points to the fact that complainant knew the nature of
the transaction he had with respondent spouses at the time the deed of sale
with assumption of mortgage was executed by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew that there was need of approval by
the PSB before he could formally assume respondent spousesâ€™ mortgage obligation
hence, false pretense is negated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents' liability, if any, is not criminal but civil.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that as far as the other respondents are concerned,
the charge must fail entirely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
officers and employees of the PSB, they were only discharging their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">duties conformably to the real estate
mortgage executed by</span> <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>, who remained the
mortgage debtor inasmuch as there was no record of approval of the
complainant's assumption of the mortgage debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant has acknowledged as much in his motion for
reconsideration with the office of the provincial fiscal, where he pressed his
charges only against <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But he must fail even with <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>
because the evidence, as assessed by Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>,
with whom we agree, shows that it is the complainant who has refused to accept <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span>' offer to turn over the certificate of title to the
subject land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only provision was
that <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> be reimbursed the amount of P29<span class="GramE">,223.76</span> which he had paid on the final amortization of the
mortgage debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result of Miranda's
refusal, <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> has filed a complaint against him for
specific performance which is still pending in the Regional Trial Court of
Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
We do not pre-empt judgment in that case but limit ourselves to the record in
the administrative case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That record
shows that <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> cannot be faulted for demanding the
amortization payment he has made on behalf of the complainant as a condition
for his release to him of the title to the mortgaged land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a demand, regardless of its intrinsic
merit, does not make him guilty of impropriety as a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding <span class="SpellE">Rayos's</span> claim for attorney's
fees in the <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span> case, that too is the subject
of his pending complaint against the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not that claim is valid, on which
we also do not rule at this time, we hold that he had not acted improperly in
charging for his professional services on the contention that he was entitled
to the fees agreed upon because of the benefits he claims to have obtained for
his client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere charging of
attorney's fees, especially if there appears to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">be </span>some basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, is not <u>per</u>
<u>se</u> conduct unbecoming a member of the bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court observes that all this unpleasantness could have been
avoided if the complainant had accepted <span class="SpellE">Rayos's</span>
offers to iron out their differences as manifested especially in his letters to
the complainant dated <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1986</st1:date>,
<st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1986</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1986</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1987</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Miranda stresses that these letters were sent only after he had taken legal
action against <span class="SpellE">Rayos</span> and do not reflect the latter's
good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That may be so, but this was
still no impediment to an amicable settlement that could have placed their
bitterness and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">mutual recriminations
behind them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is hoped that the
pending litigation between the parties may still be resolved in that spirit of
trust and friendship that used to characterize their relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
