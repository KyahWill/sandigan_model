				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appellant Guillermo Sanchez @ "Genaro," barangay captain
of Baybay Lopez, Binmaley, Pangasinan, was charged with Murder for the fatal
shooting of Fernando Visperas.  The
information alleges:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 9th day of March, 1987, in the evening
in barangay Baybay Lopez, municipality of Binmaley, province of Pangasinan, New
Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and with treachery, did
then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot Fernando Visperas with
a firearm inflicting upon him the following injuries:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.15in">-  gunshot wound, 3mm in width, between the
right clavicle and nipple, fracturing the upper third of the right (sic) 3rd
rib, hitting the upper and middle lobes of the right lung, causing massive internal
hemorrhage, passing to the back at about the level of the lower third of the
right 6th rib with a 5 mm in width of the excite (sic) wound.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.15in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">-  </span>gunshot
wound, 1/2 cm in width hitting the lateral aspect passing to the medial aspect
of the lower third of the arm, right and hitting also the skin of the abdomen,
1 1/2 inches below the right nipple and bleeding.</p>

<blockquote>which caused his death as a consequence, to
the damage and prejudice of his heirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to Article 248 of the Revised
Penal Code." (p. 8, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered a
decision on February 7, 1989, finding him guilty as charged and sentenced him:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA with the
accessories provided for by law and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He is also ordered to indemnify the heirs of the victim in
the amount of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the gravity of the offense committed (being
henious [sic] in nature) no bail bond is recommended for his provisional
liberty pending review by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let a copy of this decision be furnished the surviving heirs
of Fernando Visperas for their guidance and reference." (p. 44, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused has appealed to this Court alleging that the trial
court erred:</p>

<blockquote>1.  in not finding that the death of the
deceased was accidental, caused by the illegal acts and aggression of the
deceased himself; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  in finding him guilty of
the crime of Murder.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As summarized by the Solicitor General in his brief for the
State, the facts are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At around 11:00 o'clock in the evening of March 9, 1987, a
dance was held in the auditorium of Barangay Baybay Lopez, Binmaley, Pangasinan
to celebrate the annual fiesta of the barangay (p. 16, tsn, April 11, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A commotion erupted inside the auditorium, prompting
appellant, the barangay captain, to fire his gun in the air.  The trouble stopped and the dance continued
(pp. 9-10, tsn, February 10, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant proceeded outside the auditorium and saw Fernando
Visperas, the victim.  Without any
warning, appellant shot the victim twice.  Before falling down, the victim told his son, Hadji, to run away.  Several barangay tanods grabbed the gun of
appellant and led him away (pp. 16-18, tsn, April 11, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The victim was loaded into a Ford Fiera van and brought to
the Pangasinan Medical Center in Dagupan City where he died (pp. 18-19, tsn, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ibid.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Hadji Visperas ran from the auditorium to their house and
informed his mother of the incident.  When they returned to the auditorium, they were informed that the victim
was already brought to the hospital (pp. 4-8, tsn, April 20, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon request of the victim's wife, Dr. Teodoro Lomibao, Rural
Health Physician of Binmaley, Pangasinan, conducted an autopsy on the
victim.  He issued an autopsy
certificate (Exhibit C) containing the following findings:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.  Clothing - wearing
colored white and red T-shirt, wet with blood, torn at the front and back and
maong pant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  Gun Shot Wound - 3 mm in width, between the
right clavicle and nipple.  Fracturing
the upper third of the right 3rd rib, hitting the upper and middle lobes of the
right lung, causing massive internal hemorrhage, passing to the back at about
the level of the lower third of the right 6th rib with a 5 mm in width of the
exit wound.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  Blood - clotted blood found inside the right
thoracic cavity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.  Gun Shot Wound - 1/2 cm in width hitting the
lateral aspect passing to the medial aspect of the lower third of the arm,
right and hitting also the skin of the abdomen, 1 1/2 inches below the right
nipple and bleeding (Exh. C)." (pp. 4-7, Appellee's Brief.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the victim's death was accidental and
that the proximate and only cause thereof was the attempt of the deceased to
wrest his gun from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the accused, he had taken his supper together with
other barangay tanods in the house of barangay tanod Francisco Mendoza, near
the auditorium <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the evening of
March 9, 1987.  At ten o'clock that
night, someone passing by shouted that there was trouble in the
auditorium.  Accompanied by the barangay
tanods, he rushed to the auditorium.  Upon reaching the place, they came upon Fernando Visperas and his four
companions, namely, Pepito Visperas, Samuel Visperas, Abraham Visperas and John
Bataoil, mauling a soldier and trying to disarm another outside the auditorium.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused tried to stop them saying, "that's enough,
that's enough my son, stop the trouble." When Fernando Visperas and his
companions paid no heed to his plea, the accused pulled out his gun and fired
once in the air.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of obeying, the deceased grabbed the gunhand of the
accused saying, "Bauninam capitan" (meaning:  vulva of your mother, captain) and tried to
take away his gun.  While they were
grappling for possession of the gun, the firearm accidentally went off twice
and the deceased fell to the ground (pp. 4-5, Appellant's brief).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Domingo</u> <u>Infante</u>, a barangay tanod, 30 years old,
married, a carpenter by trade, and a resident of Baybay Lopez, Binmaley,
Pangasinan, corroborated the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Visperas fell wounded, the accused said:  "Wait, I am going to the town to
report." Infante and his other tanod companions left while the struggle
for possession of another soldier's armalite was still going on.  Upon arriving home, he related the incident
to his wife.  He is the godfather of
Hadji Visperas, a son of the deceased, Fernando Visperas.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find appellant's version of the shooting incredible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The death of the victim was not accidental.  As disclosed by the victim's son, Hadji
Visperas, who was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">an </span>eyewitness,
his father was gunned down twice by the appellant (p. 14, tsn, February 8,
1988).  His testimony was corroborated
by Abraham Visperas who declared that appellant treacherously shot the victim
without warning (p. 16, tsn, April 11, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>his counter-affidavit
(Exh. H) appellant alleged that while grappling for possession of the gun, the
victim was able to wrest it from him.  The victim was accidentally hit by two (2) shots coming from an armalite
rifle which was also the subject of another struggle.  Significantly, the appellant did not utilize at the trial that
plainly concocted story in his counter-affidavit.  As a matter of fact, the entries in the police blotter, made at
his request, did not mention any shooting or struggle for possession of a
gun.  All that was stated in the police
blotter was that appellant was dragged and mauled by the victim and his
companions, prompting him to run away.   The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">entries </span>indicate
that appellant went to the police station <u>twice</u>, first at 12:00 o'clock
midnight and again fifteen (15) minutes later, to report that he had been
mauled by Visperas.  The Certification
dated July 15, 1988 prepared by SGT. GRACIANO G. AQUINO INP Dep. Stn. Commander
(Exh. I) recites the following:</p>

<blockquote>"This is to certify that it appear in the Police Blotter

Visperas, and after he free himself from his attackers, he run away knowing
nothing of what else happen.  Sgt.
Bernardo Bautista, PA who was allegedly present at the place wherein Brgy.
Fiesta of Baybay Lopez is being held, he saw Brgy. Capt. Genaro Sanchez being
mauled he shouted purposely to pacify but instead he was allegedly boxed twice
by suspect unknown to him, so he ran to their HQS, and reported to his CO,
causing Major de Vera and his men to appear in this office.  Both Sanchez and Bautista were advice (sic)
to undergo Medical treatment at the Terrado's clinic.  Case under further inves." (p. 130, Original Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court is inclined to believe that the mauling of the appellant
by the deceased and his companions had preceded the shooting.  After being manhandled by Visperas, the
appellant went home to arm himself and thereafter returned to the auditorium to
avenge the injury to his person and his pride.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We find no reason to
depart from the well-settled rule that the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">findings </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of fact of the
trial court on the credibility of witnesses should be accorded the highest
respect because it had the advantage of observing the demeanor of the witnesses
and to discern if </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">witness is
telling the truth (People vs. Orita, 184 SCRA 105).  When there is no evidence and nothing to indicate that the
principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motives, the
presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to
full faith and credit (People vs. Claro, Jr., 165 SCRA 695).  Mere relationship of the prosecution
witnesses to the victim does not necessarily vitiate their otherwise credible
testimonies nor does it impair their positive and clear testimonies, in the
absence of proof of improper motive (People vs. Aguinaldo, 165 SCRA 682; People
vs. Santos, 183 SCRA 27).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Inasmuch as the shooting
of the deceased was preceded by an assault upon the appellant, a barangay
captain, hence, a person in authority (Art. 152, Revised Penal Code; Justo vs.
Court of Appeals, 99 Phil. 453), and, as the autopsy report showed that the
shooting of the deceased was frontal as both wounds of entry were located in
front of his body, we rule out the presence of treachery.  The crime committed by the accused was only
homicide, attended by the mitigating circumstance of sufficient provocation on
the part of the offended party immediately preceding the act (Art. 13 subpar.
4, Revised Penal Code).  The penalty for
homicide</span> is <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> (Art. 249, Revised Penal
Code).  The imposable penalty, in view
of the presence of a mitigating circumstance in the commission of the crime,
should be the minimum period of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
accused is entitled to an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">indeterminate
penalty of imprisonment ranging from five (5) years and one (1) day of <u>prision</u>
<u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u>, as maximum.  However,
the civil indemnity of P30,000 for the death of Fernando Visperas should be
increased to P50,000 in accordance with the Court's recent decisions (People
vs. Sison, G.R. No. 86455, Sept. 14, 1990; People vs. Bartulay, G.R. No. 83696,
Dec. 13, 1990).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the Court
finds the appellant, Guillermo (alias Genaro) Sanchez, guilty<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>beyond reasonable doubt of homicide with one
