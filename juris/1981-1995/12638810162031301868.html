private respondents, as plaintiffs, instituted a complaint for partition

with an area of 480 square meters and covered by Torrens Certificate of Title

the fact that <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy was the brother of <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> Soy, the deceased mother of Rosita Lopez; of
Cornelia Soy, the deceased mother of <span class="SpellE">Agueda</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubando</span>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy contested the
claims of the plaintiffs and asserted exclusive title in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He countered that the land in question was
never registered in the names of his parents <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
Soy and Ambrosia Marcella, that he had been the registered owner of the
premises since 1932 in consequence of which Original Certificate of Title No.
49661 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> was
issued in his favor, and that spouses <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Soy and

omitted to inform the Honorable Court pursuant to Section 9, Rule 3 of the

parties in the case, vacated the judgment of March 22, 1974 and granted a new
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court reasoned that the
intervention even at that stage was proper since the judgment was not complete
for want of a final project of partition supposed to be submitted to the court
for confirmation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being incomplete, the

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Appellate Court, private respondents argued that
the trial court erred in finding that the appellants (private respondents) had
not established co-ownership of the property in question; in not declaring as
invalid the sale of 140 square meters of the disputed realty even after the
annotation of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lis</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>
in the title thereof; and in not ordering the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
(petitioners) to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to appellants the 140
square meters covered by the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lis</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the bases of the above-assigned errors and on the alleged
failure of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to file their <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' brief, the Appellate Court resolved the appeal
in favor of the appellants, declaring that the sale to the <span class="SpellE">intervenors-appellees</span>
(petitioners) by <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy did not terminate the
trust relationship between the appellants and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Appellate Court dated <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1983</st1:date>, now under review,
states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, We reverse and set aside the appealed judgment and
render another one reviving and reinstating the lower court's decision of March
22, 1974 with the modification that the sales deeds executed by <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy in favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenors-appellees</span>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue to be resolved in the instant case is whether <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
6870-B was held in trust by <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy for his
sisters <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>, Cornelia and <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the Appellate Court:</p>

<blockquote>"From the time the subject property (<st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
6870) was brought under the operation of the Land Registration Act in the name
alone of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Fausto</span></span><span style=""> Soy, who had recognized the proprietary
rights of plaintiffs-appellants as co-owners, the land </span>was <span style="">impressed with a trust relationship in favor
of <span class="SpellE">Fausto's</span> sisters or their children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> sold a
portion of 140 square meters to <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, the
relationship of trust included said <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that after <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy, the predecessor-in-interest of herein

thirty years, his title had become indeÂ­feasible and his dominical rights over
it could no longer be challenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
insinuation as to the existence of an implied or constructive trust should not
be allowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondents have
invoked Article 1456 of the Civil Code which states that "if property is
acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is, by force of law,
considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from
whom the property comes."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trust alluded to in
this case is a constructive trust arising by operation of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a trust in the technical sense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even assuming that there
was an implied trust, private respondents' attempt at <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
(functionally, an action for partition is both an action for declaration of
co-ownership, and for segregation and conveyance of a determinate portion of
the subject property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> vs. IAC, G. R. No. 75886, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="8"><span style="">August 30, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, 165 SCRA 118) was clearly barred by
prescription.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Prescription is rightly regarded as a statute of repose whose
object is to suppress fraudulent and stale claims from springing up at great
distances of time and surprising the parÂ­ties or their representatives when the
facts have become obscure from the lapse of time or the defective memory or
death or removal of witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of real property to enforce an implied trust prescribes in ten years, the
period reckoned from the issuance of the adverse title to the property which
operates as a constructive notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, that assertion of adverse title, which was an
explicit indication of repudiation of the trust for the purpose <span style="">of </span>the statute of limitations, took
place when OCT No. 49661 was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>
Soy in 1932, to the excluÂ­sion of his three sisters.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But even if there were no repudiation --- as private reÂ­spondent
Rosita Lopez would have us believe when she testified in court that while <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy might have succeeded in securing title in his
sole name, he nonetheless recognized the co-ownership between him and his
sisters --- the rule in this jurisÂ­diction is that an action to enforce an
implied trust may be circumscribed not only by prescription but also by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, in which case repudiation is not even required.</p>

<p class="BODY">From 1932 to 1965, or a period of thirty-three years, private
respondents had literally slept on their rights, presuming they had any. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They can no longer dispute the conclusive and
incontrovertible character of <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Soy's title as
they are deemed, by their unreasonably long inaction, to have acquiesced
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the law protects
those who are vigilant of their rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Undue delay in the enforcement of a right is strongly indicative of a
lack of merit in the claim, since it is human nature for persons to assert
their rights most vigorously when threatened or invaded.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>
