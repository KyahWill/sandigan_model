Regional Trial Court, Eighth Judicial District, Branch XXVII, <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, in Criminal
Case No. 2455, finding appellant Glenn Velasco guilty of Murder with Direct
Assault Upon a Person in Authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision reads -</p>

<blockquote>â€œWHEREFORE, and in view of all the foregoing, the Court finds
accused GLENN VELASCO guilty, beyond reasonable doubt as principal by direct
participation, of the complex crime of Murder with Direct Assault Upon a Person
in Authority, with the attendance of the generic aggravating circumstance of
taking advantage of public position and ignominy, without any mitigating
circumstances in offset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conformably
with the pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal Code, the Court accordingly
hereby sentences the above-named, accused to the supreme penalty of death, to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>
in the amount of P12,000.00, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Decision, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">p. </span>6, annexed to Appellant's Brief, p. 103, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution discloses that:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the evening of <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1983</st1:date>,
in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Guinsorongan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Chairman Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>
was seated in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>bench near the
store fronting the house of Glenn Velasco, the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> was waiting
for the appellant to arrive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Earlier
that evening, appellant, a soldier in the Philippine Army stationed at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lukban</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Naulong</span>, had illegally discharged his <span class="SpellE">armalite</span>
rifle behind the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Hall, thereby causing a
commotion in the vicinity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For which
reason, he was apprehended by a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanod</span> and taken to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Chairman <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> (pp. 5-8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
July 10, 1984).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">arrived, <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>
told him to sit down and they talked to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was warned by <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>
not to discharge his firearm again without any reason because such
indiscriminate firing created panic and fear among the residents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Grudgingly, appellant answered
"yes." Then, suddenly, appellant stood up from his seat and went
straight into his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a loud voice
he ordered his wife to get his <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly, </span>appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">emerged from his house carrying his rifle and
walked to the middle of the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> calmly approached appellant and after declaring
that he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Chairman of the area attempted to pacify him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of being pacified, appellant
menacingly pointed his rifle at <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> and angrily
said "<span class="SpellE">Magdasal</span> ka <span class="SpellE">na</span>"
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">("say y</span>our prayers
now") (p. 4, Brief for the <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>; p. 117, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He ordered <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">kneel
down and </span>raise his arms <span class="SpellE">aline</span> with the
shoulders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>
offered no resistance and did as he was told.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just then, Leo <span class="SpellE">Colocado</span>, a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tanod</span>, arrived and interceded on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
faced <span class="SpellE">Colocado</span> and told him not to interfere.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, he ordered <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>
to kiss the cement floor and do push ups.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Colocado</span> again butted in, appellant fired
several rounds in his direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Colocado</span> who was grazed by ricocheting bullets and fearful
for his life scampered away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Turning his
ire once more on <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>, appellant eventually
fired two successive volleys.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
volley hit <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> on the thighs and when he
attempted to stand up appellant let loose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
</span>second volley which hit <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> on the chest
(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp. 9-17, <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1984</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp.
105-106, <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1984</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, autopsy findings revealed that <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span> expired from fatal gunshot wounds inflicted by
appellant on his person (see <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was thus charged with Murder with Direct Assault upon a
Person in Authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was likewise
charged in another <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">information, lodged

<p class="BODY">The records of this case belie the contention of appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings on <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1984</st1:date> show that the lower court took

statements of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">lower court -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
the Court has explained before the meaning of the contents of the information,
the Court, considering the gravity of the offense charged, will explain to you,
not only the literal meaning but the legal consequences of your plea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Your pleas of guilty will not be considered
as a mitigating circumstance and it will not lessen penalty imposed upon you
because the prosecution has already presented a witness ... two witnesses in
this case, do you understand that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
offense charged is a complex offense actually two grave offenses are charged in
one information and under the law, the penalty that is imposable is the maximum
of the graver offense charged in the information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The offenses charged are murder and assault
upon a person in authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Murder is
the graver offense here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the penalty
for murder is from reclusion temporal (maximum) to death and the maximum of
reclusion temporal is 17 years four months and one day to death and because the
law says the penalty to be imposed is the maximum, most probably and I think
the imposable penalty is death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you
understand that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
information alleges that you took advantage of your public position, this means
that you abused or took advantage of the ascendancy or influence which you have
in virtue of your position as a member of the Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span>the time when you committed
the offense charged?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">information </span>also charges, as you
heard when it was read, that you used treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Treachery means that you used in the
commission of the offense ... you employed means, methods, or forms ... in the
execution of the offense charged which tended directly and especially to ensure
the execution of the felony without risk to yourself in any defense from which
the person whom you attack might make, do you understand that?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Remember you are not being forced.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, </span>sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
decision of the Supreme Court among others say that in treachery the method
used must be consciously and deliberately adopted by you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
must remind you and you must answer on your own volition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are trying to stick to the truth. </blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
information also alleges that the crime was qualified, attended by the
circumstance of evident premeditation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the law, it connotes the following elements, 1 â€“ that there was a
time when you decided or determined to commit the crime charged in the
information, 2 â€“ that you did acts which showed that you clung to that
determination to commit the offense charged, 3 â€“ that you were given sufficient
time to meditate and cool off but you still persisted in your determination to
commit the crime charged?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
also used a superior and powerful firearm, <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span>
Caliber 5.56 MM rifle?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
person whom you killed was a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain by the
name of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>. When you killed him you
knew beforehand that he was a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, because he is the uncle of my wife.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
knew the person in authority?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
killing him you also ordered the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain to
kneel down, both arms stretched and to kiss the cemented pavement and he obeyed
and while thus kneeling and pleading not to be killed, the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain was shot by you <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">several times
with your weapon, is it not?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's
not that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time there was vehicle
that arrived and the head lights focused while we were having some altercation
with him and when I looked towards the vehicle he approached me and the fact
that I was surprised, I squeezed the trigger of the <span class="SpellE">armalite</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rifle which was then pointing towards
the ground and up towards the sky because the tendency of the <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> whenever squeezed is going upwards and not
downwards.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
information also said that you killed the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain while he was in the performance or on the occasion of the performance
of his duties as <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain because he was
trying to pacify you at that time of the commission of the offense?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said that you did not intend to kill the victim Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Labongcay</span>
because you<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>just accidentally
squeezed the trigger of your <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> and you said
before you chose that particular method of attack <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in order to ensure the execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Will you explain to the court your apparently inconsistent statement?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
is that yes sir?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
I shot him while he was kneeling down his arms stretched.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
you admit that at the time you killed him the deceased <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain had his arms stretched and he was kneeling and pleading not to be
killed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is very important, do you
admit it or not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">sir. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Enter a plea of
guilty for the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution
has already presented evidence in these cases, two witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has admonished Trial
