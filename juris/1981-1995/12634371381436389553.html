ED VINCENT ALBANO, PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH X, DEPUTY SHERIFF JESS ARREOLA, VICENTE CAÑEDA AND THE HON.

				<BR><STRONG>VITUG, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Spouses Miguel and Thelma Masinsin, et al., instituted this
petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, prohibition, relief from judgment, as
well as declaratory relief, with prayer for preliminary mandatory injunction,
asking us to order the Metropolitan Trial Court ("MTC") of Manila,
Branch X, to cease and desist from further proceeding with Civil Case No.
107203-CV.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case emerged from an ejectment suit (docketed Civil Case No.
107203-CV) filed by private respondent Vicente Cañeda ("Cañeda"),
then as plaintiffs, against herein petitioners, as defendants, with the
Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila (Branch X).  After trial, the MTC, on 01 July 1985, rendered judgment; thus:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the
defendants and all persons claiming right under them to vacate the premises and
to remove their house/apartment and surrender possession of the subject land to
the plaintiff; to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P100.00 a month from January
1987 as the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises
until the land is actually vacated, and the costs of suit."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">No appeal having been taken therefrom,
the judgment became final and executory.  On 22 August 1985, petitioners filed a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
before the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch XXXII) seeking the annulment
of the aforesaid decision in the ejectment case and to set aside an order of
its execution.  The petition was in due
time dismissed.  Again, no appeal was
taken therefrom.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 07 October 1985, a complaint for "Annulment of Judgment,
Lease Contract and Damages" was filed by petitioners before the Regional
Trial Court of Manila (Branch XLI) asking, in main, for the nullification of
the judgment in the ejectment case.  The
complaint was dismissed on the ground of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.  This time, petitioners appealed the
dismissal to the Court of Appeals.  Meanwhile, a writ of execution was issued by the MTC for the enforcement
of its decision.  The writ, however, was
held in abeyance when petitioners deposited with the Court of Appeals the sum
of P3,000.00 in cash plus an amount of P100.00 to be paid every month beginning
February 1987.  On 11 March 1987, the
Court of Appeals affirmed the order of dismissal of the lower court.  Petitioners' recourse to this Court was to
be of no avail.  The petition was
denied, and an entry of judgment was made on 14 July 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the records were remanded to the MTC for
execution.  When petitioners refused to
remove their house on the premises in question, upon motion of private
respondent, an order of demolition was issued.  Shortly thereafter, the demolition began.  Before the completion of the demolition, a restraining order was
issued by the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch XIX) following a petition
for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, with preliminary injunction and restraining
order, filed by petitioners.   On 23
February 1988, the trial court dismissed the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unfazed by the series of dismissals of their complaints and
petitions, petitioners assailed anew the MTC decision in a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>,
with preliminary injunction, and for declaratory relief (docketed Civil Case
No. 88-43944) before the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch XXV), which,
again, issued a restraining order.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent then filed a motion for an <u>alias</u> writ
of execution with the MTC.  An <u>ex-parte</u>
motion of petitioners for the issuance of a second restraining order was this
time denied by the RTC (Branch XXV).<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On 23 August 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the trial court, ultimately, dismissed the petition with costs against
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, petitioners contend that the MTC of Manila
(Branch X) has lost jurisdiction to enforce its decision, dated 01 July 1985,
in Civil Case No. 107203, when the property in question was proclaimed an area
for priority development by the National Housing Authority on 01 December 1987
by authority of Presidential Decree 2016.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is totally without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving this issue, we only have to refer to our resolution
of 01 February 1993 in G.R. No. 98446, entitled, "Spouses Thelma R.
Masinsin, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.," to which this case is
intimately related, where we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The singular question common to both cases submitted
for resolution of this court is the implication of Presidential Decree No.
1517, otherwise known as the ‘Urban Land Reform Law,’ and its amendments or
ramifications embodied in Proclamation No. 1893, as amended by Proclamation No.
1967 and Presidential Decree No. 2016.  All the above statutes are being implemented by the Housing and Land Use
Regulatory Board, and the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council,
Office of the President.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is a prejudicial issue the answer to which hangs the
resolution of this case.  On May 20,
1992, this Court required the National Housing Authority to submit a Comment on
the status of the program of acquisition by the Government of the land area
which includes the disputed property, as part of the Areas for Priority
Development (APD), under the aforementioned decrees and proclamations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In compliance with said order of this Court, Mr. Andres C.
Lingan, Manager of the Metro Manila Project Department of the National Housing
Authority, submitted the following report on the status of Lot 6-A, Block 1012,
located at No. 1890 Obesis Street, Pandacan, Manila, known as the Carlos
Estate, an APD site.  Pertinent portions
of the report read:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Please be informed that Lot 6-A, Block 1012 located at No. 1890
Obesis St., Pandacan, Manila which is the subject matter of the case and
located within the Carlos Estate declared as APD site pursuant to Presidential
Proclamation No. 1967, <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>for</u> <u>acquisition</u> <u>by</u>
<u>NHA.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="2Q">'The Carlos Estate is located outside of the NHA projects under the
Zonal Improvement Project (ZIP) and Community Mortgage Program (CMP).  The site, however, is under the
administration of the Presidential Commission on Urban Poor (PCUP) for
acquisition and upgrading.  (Underlining
Supplied.)'</p>

<blockquote>"The above information answers the uncertainty concerning the
status of the alleged negotiation for the acquisition by the government of
certain areas in Metro Manila.  The NHA
is definitely NOT acquiring the said lot for its program.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the purpose of this Petition for Review is
to set aside the decision of the respondent Court of Appeals which affirmed the
decision of the lower courts, in order to avoid eviction from the disputed
premises and to be allowed to acquire the same allegedly under the Community
Mortgage Program of the National Housing Authority, we find the petition
without merit and deny the same.  Consequently, the petition is DISMISSED."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What immediately catches one's attention to this case is the
evident predilection of petitioners, through different counsel, to file
pleadings, one after another, from which not even this Court has been
spared.  The utter lack of merit of the
complaints and petitions simply evinces the deliberate intent of petitioners to
prolong and delay the inevitable execution of a decision that has long become
final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Four times did the petitioners, with the assistance of counsel,
try to nullify the same MTC decision before different branches of the court,
trifling with judicial processes.  Never, again, should this practice be countenanced.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lawyer's oath to which we have all subscribed in solemn
agreement in dedicating ourselves to the pursuit of justice, is not a mere
fictile of words, drift and hollow, but a sacred trust that we must uphold and
keep inviolable.  Perhaps, it is time we
are here reminded of that pledge; thus -</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">LAWYER'S
OATH<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I, x x x, do solemnly swear that I will maintain allegiance to
the Republic of the Philippines; I will support and defend its Constitution and
obey the laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities
therein; I will do no falsehood nor consent to its commission; <u>l</u> <u>will
not</u> <u>wittingly</u> <u>or</u> <u>willingly</u> <u>promote</u> <u>or</u> <u>sue</u>
<u>any</u> <u>groundless,</u> <u>false</u> <u>or</u> <u>unlawful</u> <u>suit</u>
<u>nor</u> <u>give</u> <u>aid</u> <u>nor</u> <u>consent</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>same;</u> <u>I</u> <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>delay</u> <u>any</u> <u>man's</u>
<u>cause</u> <u>for</u> <u>money</u> <u>or</u> <u>malice</u> <u>and</u> <u>will</u>
<u>conduct</u> <u>myself</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>lawyer</u> <u>according</u> <u>to</u>

<u>fidelity</u> <u>as</u> <u>well</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>courts</u> <u>as</u>

<u>myself</u> <u>this</u> <u>obligation</u> <u>voluntary,</u> <u>without</u> <u>any</u>
<u>mental</u> <u>reservation</u> <u>or</u> <u>purpose</u> <u>of</u> <u>evasion.</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>SO HELP ME GOD." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have since emphasized in no uncertain terms that any act on
the part of a lawyer, an officer of the court, which visibly tends to obstruct,
pervert, impede and degrade the "administration of justice is contumacious
calling for both an exercise of disciplinary action and warranting application
of the contempt power.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED.  Petitioners' counsel of record is hereby
strongly CENSURED and WARNED that a similar infraction of the lawyer's oath in
the future will be dealt with most severely.  Double costs against petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">This resolution is immediately executory.</p>

The Court has since issued Administrative Circular No. 04-94, effective 01
April 1994, hereunder quoted for guidance:</p>

ADDITIONAL REQUISITES FOR CIVIL COMPLAINTS, PETITIONS AND OTHER INITIATORY
PLEADINGS FILED IN ALL COURTS AND AGENCIES, OTHER THAN THE SUPREME COURT AND
THE COURT OF APPEALS, TO PREVENT FORUM SHOPPING OR MULTIPLE FILING OF SUCH
PLEADINGS.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"Revised Circular No. 28-91,
dated April 1, 1994, applies to and governs the filing of petitions in the
Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals and is intended to prevent the multiple
filing of petitions or complaints involving the same issues in other tribunals
or agencies as a form of forum shopping.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"Complementary thereto and for
the same purpose, <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>requirements</u>, in addition
to those in pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court and existing circulars, <u>shall</u>
<u>be</u> <u>strictly</u> <u>complied</u> <u>with</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>filing</u>

shall be subject to sanctions provided hereunder:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"(1) The plaintiff,
petitioner, applicant or principal party seeking relief in the complaint,
petition, application or other initiatory pleading shall certify under oath in
such original pleading, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and
simultaneously filed therewith, to the truth of the following facts and
undertakings:  (a) he has not
theretofore commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues
in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or any other tribunal or agency;
(b) to the best of his knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending in
the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or any other tribunal or agency; (c)
if there is any such action or proceeding which is either pending or <u>may</u>
<u>have</u> <u>been</u> <u>terminated</u>, he must state the status thereof;
and (d) if he should thereafter learn that a similar action or proceeding has
been filed or is pending before the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or any

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"(2) Any violation of this

forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple
complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a
ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of
court.  Furthermore, the submission of a
false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as
provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court,
without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the
filing of a criminal action against the guilty party." (Underscoring
