<blockquote>"Clearly accused Baltazar De Leon is
neither authorized nor licensed to recruit workers for overseas jobs and yet he
and his wife recruited workers, talked to the applicants and collected fees for
requirements that each applicant had to comply with in order that their
applications may be processed.  Although
Mrs. De Leon was more active in the recruitment, accused Baltazar played an
important part as both spouses convincingly played out their roles resulting in
the applicants' reposing their trust and belief in them.  It is of little surprise that the
complaining witnesses conclusively identified accused Baltazar as the man who
recruited them or their relatives.  Said
witnesses even gave in evidence the list of requirements and fees that they
were told to pay.  Said lists clearly
show that a great deal of money was involved and received by the accused.  The charade played by both accused show a
unity of purpose and unity in execution of their unlawful objective
establishing the existence of a conspiracy for which both accused must suffer
the same penalty.  <i>(People vs. Talla,
</i>181 SCRA 133).”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The summary by the People of the prosecution's evidence
concerning the recruitment activities of the appellant is hereby adopted, it
being fully supported by the testimonies of the complaining witnesses:</p>

<blockquote>"Camila del Rosario, who was a neighbor of appellant, told
Noeta Perez, Eugene Panganiban, Elvira Alonzo, Lourdes Bernabe, and one Ador,
all of whom were working for the same employer, that del Rosario's daughter was
able to work abroad through the efforts of appellant and his wife (TSN, N.
Perez, June 26, 1991, p. 4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On September 16, 1990, del Rosario, together with Noeta Perez and
the latter's sister Lourdes and brother Daniel, went to appellant's house in
Pateros, Rizal.  Noeta Perez's purpose
in going to appellant's house was to apply for overseas jobs for her brother
Daniel and sister Lourdes.  When del
Rosario, Noeta Perez and her brother reached appellant's house, they met
appellant and his wife who informed them that they have already sent persons to
Micronesia who were hired as chambermaids and roomboys.  Noeta Perez then asked her sister and
brother to apply, and she gave P1,380.00 to appellant's wife (<u>Id</u>., pp.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> 5-6).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The following day, September 17, 1990, appellant's wife asked
Daniel to go back together with Lourdes to file their application and to
undergo medical examination.  On the
same day, Daniel and Lourdes gave appellant and his wife P2,500.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for the passport, and, in addition, they paid
</span>P5,000.00 to appellant.  For
helping Daniel and Lourdes get jobs abroad, appellant demanded P6,380.00 from
each of the applicants allegedly for the processing of the papers, medical
examination, pictures and passport.  Noeta Perez was able to give P3,000.00 to appellant for her-sister
Lourdes' application, but she, was unable to give any amount for Daniel's
application (Id., pp. 6-9).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime in November, 1990, Noeta Peres received a letter from the
National Bureau of Investigation ('NBI') saying that the applications for
overseas jobs sent to Micronesia were sent to the NBI because there were no
such job orders from Micronesia.  Upon
getting this information, Noeta, together with her sister Lourdes and brother
Daniel, went to the NBI which then confirmed the information.  Evidently, Lourdes and Daniel could not have
gone to Micronesia since the alleged jobs offered to them by appellant never
existed (Id., pp. 9-11).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Cesar Cortez suffered a similar fate as that of Daniel and Lourdes
Perez.  Cortez came to know appellant
through a friend, Alfredo Gutierrez, who applied with appellant for an overseas
job in Micronesia.  Because his friend
applied, Cortez also applied with appellant for a job as roomboy in
Micronesia.  When Cortez filed his
application, appellant immediately required him to give P680.00 for alleged
medical fee, which Cortez paid.  After
paying the medical fee, appellant's wife asked Cortez to pay P175.00 as
transportation fee for securing the passport.  Then appellant asked P1,000.00 as downpayment for the passport, which
amount was paid to and received by appellant's wife.  In addition, Cortez paid P1,650.00, which was received by
appellant's wife in the presence of appellant, for full payment of the
passport.  Cortez gave these amounts to
appellant or his wife between the second week of August, 1990 and second week
of September, 1990.  Appellant promised
Cortez that he could leave for Micronesia in the month of September, 1990, and
when this did not materialize, appellant promised again that Cortez could leave
by November, 1990.  Cortez, however, was
unable to leave for Micronesia for it turned out that appellant had no business
partner in Micronesia (TSN, C. Cortez, October 29, 1991, pp. 2-4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Alfredo Gutierrez, a friend of Cortez, also applied with appellant
for the job of driver in Guam.  Gutierrez knew appellant because a certain Mila introduced him to
appellant who represented that he could send workers abroad.  The introduction occurred at appellant's
house in the first week of August, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">1990.  Appellant asked for P680.00 allegedly </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">for medical fee and pictures, which
Gutierrez paid.  Gutierrez was required
to give additional amounts, and the total amount he paid reached P3,500.00.  He paid this amount to appellant for the
promised job as driver in Guam.  Gutierrez, however, was unable to leave for Guam because it turned out
that there was no such job order in Guam (TSN, A. Gutierrez, October 21, 1991,
pp. 2-4)."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution further proved through the unrebutted testimony
of Elisa Roque, Senior Officer of the Licensure Division of the Philippine
Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), that the appellant does not have any
license or authority <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there is nothing in the appellant's brief
testimony except the denial of the separate accusations of the complaining
witnesses and the assertion that he does not know anything about the
transactions between the complainants and his co-accused as he was always out
of his residence at daytime.  He
declared that he was employed as a driver by Reymar Advertising, which is owned
by Mr. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Reynaldo Bucsit.  He served </span>as such daily from 8:00

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before proceeding any further, some observations on the information
filed are in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information charges the appellant with "the crime of
Illegal Recruitment under P.D. No. 2018 (Large Scale)." However, this
decree merely further amended Articles 38 and 39 of the Labor Code<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

by making large-scale illegal recruitment, <i>i.e.</i>, committed against three
or more persons individually or collectively, a crime of economic sabotage and
punishable with life imprisonment.  More
precisely then, the information should have been for the violation of Article
38 in relation to Article 39 of the Labor Code, as amended.  Although this error seems to be innocuous
since the body of the complaint recites the elements of large-scale illegal
recruitment, proof beyond reasonable doubt of which would sustain a conviction
under Articles 38 and 39 of the said Code, we, nevertheless, make these
observations by way of advice to prosecutors to exercise the greatest care in
the preparation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">informations.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portions of Articles 38 and 39 of the Labor Code,
as amended by P.D. No. 2018, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 38.  <i>Illegal

practices enumerated under Article 34 of this Code, to be undertaken by non?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">licensees

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Illegal recruitment when committed by a

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">x x x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 13(b) of the same Code defines recruitment as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"'Recruitment and placement' refers to any act of canvassing,

enumerated in Article 34 of the said Code is:</p>

<blockquote>"(b)
To furnish or publish any false notice or information or document in relation
to recruitment or employment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And now to the merits of this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the assigned error, the appellant contends that: (a)
he did not transact business with any one of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">complaining </span>witnesses nor did he receive any monetary
consideration from them; (b) granting for the sake of argument that his wife
was engaged in illegal recruitment, there is no <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">sufficient evidence to prove that he acted in conspiracy with
his wife; (c) he had no opportunity to engage in recruitment because he was
then employed as a driver by one Reynaldo Bucsit with a work schedule from 8:00
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and likewise worked as a driver of a passenger jeepney until
midnight or the morning of the following day; and (d) the complaining witnesses
implicated him because he is the husband of Marietta de Leon who allegedly
recruited them but who is now at large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Our own reading and evaluation of the testimonies of the
complaining witnesses lead to no other conclusion than that the appellant and
his wife were co-conspirators in the illegal recruitment business conducted in
their residence with each contributing coordinative and cooperative acts to
insure the success of an enterprise that provided them with income for their
mutual benefit and advantage.  The
complainants separately came to the appellant's residence on various dates
because they were informed by their co-workers that he and his wife were known
to be recruiting for employment in Micronesia, Guam and Singapore.  In all the occasions when they came to his
house, the appellant was always there.  Complainant Noeta Perez categorically declared that the appellant and
his wife told her and her companions that "they sent people abroad, in
Micronesia, hired [sic] there as chambermaid and roomboy" and that she
gave the money demanded in connection with the application of her brother and
sister to Marietta in the presence of the appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Complainant Eugenia Cruz declared that when she and her companions, Elma Conde
and Adelaide Cabungkay, were in the house of the appellant filling up the
papers in connection with their application for employment abroad, the latter
"help [sic] us how to file the papers given to" them and told them
that they "would be receiving salary of $2.15/hour," and that she
gave P6,380.00 to Marietta in the presence of the appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Complainant Flordeliza Beo testified that when she accompanied her husband to
apply for employment, the appellant explained to them the terms of employment
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was </span>present when she gave
the amount of P6,380.00 to Marietta.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Complainant Alfredo Gutierrez was directly introduced to the appellant by Mila
and the appellant himself asked from him various sums, amounting to P3,500.00,
ostensibly in connection with his application for employment, and personally
received it from Alfredo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Complainant Cesar Cortes was also directly introduced to the appellant and paid
the various sums demanded from him to Marietta in the presence of the
appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Complainant Lourdes Bernabe testified that the appellant offered her the job of
domestic helper in Singapore, informed her of the requirements for her
application, and, together with his wife, received her payment of P2,500.00
purportedly for the processing of her papers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All these acts of the appellant and his wife conclusively
established a common criminal design mutually deliberated upon and accomplished
through coordinated moves.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such acts constitute enlisting, contracting or procuring workers
for or promising them overseas employment, which are among the acts of
recruitment embraced in Article 13(b) of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">Labor Code, as amended.  The furnishing of the victims with certain documents which they were
required to fill up allegedly in connection with their overseas employment,
which actually did not exist, also constitutes the violation of paragraph (b),
Article 34 of the same Code.  Since the
appellant does not have the license or authority to recruit and he committed
the said acts against at least three individuals, he is guilty of large-scale
illegal recruitment under Article 38, which offense is penalized with life
imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">in the succeeding Article 39.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded by the appellant's contention that he could
not have transacted business with the complainants and participated in the
activities of his wife because he was not in his residence during the daytime
in view of his employment at Reymar Advertising and his driving of a passenger
jeepney after working hours until midnight.  He sets up, in effect, the defense of alibi.  We have carefully searched for a statement in his testimony in
court as to the specific dates he was employed by Reymar Advertising.  We found none.  Rather, it was his witness, Mr. Reynaldo Bucsit, who attempted to
do so by claiming that the appellant was his personal driver from July 1987 to 22
November 1990.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
We then have a situation where a party who claimed that it was impossible for
him to have committed a crime because he was somewhere else at the time of its
commission did not even specifically and explicitly testify that the dates when
he was allegedly somewhere else coincided with the dates specified in the information
and proven by the evidence as the dates when the crime was committed.  This is rather strange and only manifests
the weakness of his plea.  In any case,
the trial court disregarded the testimony of Mr. Bucsit.  Settled is the rule that a trial court's
finding on the credibility of a witness is entitled to the highest degree of
respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any showing that
the said court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or
circumstances of weight and substance which would have affected the result of
the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
But even if Mr. Bucsit's testimony were to be given full faith, it discloses
that it was not at all impossible for the appellant to have met and transacted
business with the complainants or to have participated in the business of his
wife since he drove for Mr. Bucsit for only four or five days a week.  The latter declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In a week, how many
days did he perform his job?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes four or five
days in a week because he had to rest after driving the whole day, sir."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the ‘appellant was positively identified by the
complainants’.  It is axiomatic that
alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's final argument that the complainants filed the case
against<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>him in order to harass
him and compel him "to answer their money claims, after failing to recover
from the real culprit,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> is
nothing but a flimsy excuse which we cannot accept.  As previously discussed, the appellant is a co­-conspirator in
the crime of illegal recruitment, and in conspiracy the act of one is the act
of all.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision appealed from is therefore fully supported by facts
which established the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot end this case without some parting thoughts to conclude
what we had stated at the beginning.  Something must be wrong somewhere if, in spite of the stiff penalties
for illegal recruitment, some still brazenly take advantage of the misery of
others and profit from their misfortunes while many still fall <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">for the
false promises of illegal recruiters despite the painful lessons the
experiences of others have taught.  What
is clear to us is that illegal recruiters </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">cannot </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">flout our </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">laws
and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">prey
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the hard
lot of others if the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Government
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">had
the will to resolutely enforce the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">laws </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">against illegal recruitment and to
be merciless against the violators.  They do not deserve any mercy.  Large-scale illegal recruitment is a crime which is not difficult to discover,
prosecute and prove, for it cannot be done in absolute secrecy.  That there must be an end to illegal
recruitment is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">a matter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">of public policy for not only must the
State protect those who, because of economic difficulties or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">lack </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">of employment opportunities in the
country, seek greener pastures in foreign lands and from whose earnings the
State itself benefits, it must also punish to the fullest </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">extent </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">of the law
illegal recruiters, especially those engaged in syndicated or large-scale
illegal recruitment, who </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">continue
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">to
wreak havoc on our economy.  It </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">thus

pernicious evil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
