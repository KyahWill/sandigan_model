				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once more the Court is called upon to delineate constitutional
boundaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this petition for
prohibition, the petitioners, who are taxpayers, lawyers, members of the
Integrated Bar of the Philippines and professors of Constitutional Law, seek to
enjoin the respondent Salvador <span class="SpellE">Mison</span> from performing
the functions of the Office of Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and the
respondent Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Carague</span>, as Secretary of the
Department of Budget, from effecting disbursements in payment of <span class="SpellE">Mison's</span> salaries and emoluments, on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Mison's</span> appointment <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs is unconstitutional by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reason of its not having been confirmed by the
Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents, on the other hand, maintain the constitutionality of respondent <span class="SpellE">Mison's</span> appointment without the confirmation of the
Commission on Appointments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the demands of public interest, including the need for
stability in the public service, the Court resolved to give due course to the
petition and decide, setting aside the finer procedural questions of whether
prohibition is the proper remedy to test respondent <span class="SpellE">Mison's</span>
right to the Office of Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and of whether the
petitioners have a standing to bring this suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, and for the same purpose, the Court allowed
the Commission on Appointments to intervene and file a petition in
intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Comment was required of
respondents on said petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
comment was filed, followed by <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> reply
thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties were also heard in
oral argument on <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="12">8 December 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case assumes added significance because, at bottom line, it
involves a conflict between two (2) great departments of government, the
Executive and Legislative Departments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It also occurs early in the life of the 1987 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The task of the Court is rendered lighter by the existence of
relatively clear provisions in the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In cases like this, we follow what the Court,
speaking through Mr. Justice (later, Chief Justice) Jose <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
Santos stated in <u>Gold Creek Mining Corp., vs. Rodriguez</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

that:</p>

<blockquote>"The fundamental principle of constitutional construction is
to give effect to the intent of the framers of the organic law and of the
people adopting it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The intention to
which force is to be given is that which is embodied and expressed in the
constitutional provisions themselves".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court will thus construe the applicable constitutional
provisions, not in accordance with how the executive or the legislative
department may want them construed, but in accordance with what they say and
provide.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Section
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">16, Article VII of the 1987
Constitution says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The President shall nominate and, with the consent of the
Commission on Appointments, appoint the heads of the executive departments,
ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, or officers of the armed
forces from the rank of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose
appointments are vested in him in this Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall also appoint all other officers of
the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by law, and
those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Congress may, by law, vest the appointment
of other officers lower in rank in the President alone, in the courts, or in
the heads of the departments, agencies, commissions or boards.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The President shall have the power to make appointments
during the recess of the Congress, whether voluntary or compulsory, but such
appointments shall be effective only until disapproval by the Commission on
Appointments or until the next adjournment of the Congress".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is readily apparent
that under the provisions of the 1987 Constitution, just quoted, there are four
(4) groups of officers whom the President shall appoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These four (4) groups, to which we will
hereafter refer from time to time, are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><u>First</u>, the heads of the <span class="SpellE">excutive</span>
departments, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, officers of the
armed forces from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">rank of colonel
or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested in him in
this Constitution</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Second</u>, all other officers of the Government whose
appointments are not otherwise provided for by law<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote><u>Third</u>, those whom the President may be authorized by law to
appoint;</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Fourth</u>, officers lower in rank<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
whose appointments the Congress may by law vest in the President alone.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first group of officers is clearly appointed with the consent
of the Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appointments of such officers are initiated by nomination and, if the
nomination is confirmed by the Commission on Appointments, the President
appoints.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The second, third and
fourth groups of officers are the present bone of contention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Should they be appointed by the President
with or without the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on Appointments?
By following the accepted rule in constitutional and statutory construction
that an express enumeration of subjects excludes others not enumerated, it
would follow that only those appointments to positions expressly stated in the
first group require the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on
Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But we need not rely
solely on this basic rule of constitutional construction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We can refer to historical background as well
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to the records of the 1986 Constitutional
Commission to determine, with more accuracy, if not precision, the intention of
the framers of the 1987 Constitution and the people adopting it, on whether the
appointments by the President, under the second, third and fourth groups,
require the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, in this task, the following advice of
Mr. Chief Justice </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">J. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Abad</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> Santos in <u>Gold</u> </span><u>Creek</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is apropos:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In deciding this point, it should be borne in mind that a
constitutional provision must be presumed to have been framed and adopted in
the light and understanding of prior and existing laws and with reference to
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Courts are bound to presume
that the people adopting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

upon the subjects to which its provisions relate, and upon which they express

ministers and consuls x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the 1973 Constitution provides that -</p>

<blockquote>"Section 10.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
President shall appoint the heads of bureaus and offices, the officers of the
Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the rank of Brigadier General or Commodore, and all other officers of the
government whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and those
whom he may be authorized by law to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">appoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> may by law vest in the Prime Minister, members
of the Cabinet, the Executive Committee, Courts, Heads of Agencies,
Commissions, and Boards the power to appoint inferior officers in their
respective offices".<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the 1935 Constitution, almost all presidential
appointments required the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on
Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is now a sad part of
our political history that the power of confirmation by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Commission on Appointments, under the 1935
Constitution, transformed that commission, many times, into a venue of
"horse-trading" and similar malpractices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the 1973 Constitution, consistent with the
authoritarian pattern in which it was molded and re-molded by successive
amendments, placed the absolute power of appointment in the President with
hardly any check on the part of the legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the above two (2) extremes, one, in the 1935 Constitution
and the other, in the 1973 Constitution, it is not difficult for the Court to
state that the framers of the 1987 Constitution and the people adopting it, struck
a "middle ground" by requiring the consent (confirmation) of the
Commission on Appointments for the first group of appointments and leaving to
the President, without such confirmation, the appointment of other officers,
i.e., those in the second and third groups as well as those in the fourth
group, i.e., officers of lower rank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceedings in the 1986 Constitutional Commission support
this conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original text of
Section 16, Article VII, as proposed by the Committee on the Executive of the
1986 Constitutional Commission, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 16.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
president shall nominate and, with the consent of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>Commission on Appointment, shall
appoint the heads of the executive departments and <u>bureaus</u>, ambassadors,
other public ministers and consuls, or officers of the armed forces from the
rank of colonel or naval captain and all other officers of the Government whose
appointments are not otherwise provided for by law, and those whom he may be
authorized by law to appoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Congress may by law vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President
alone, in the courts, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in the heads
of departments</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>"
(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above text is almost <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span><u>verbatim</u> copy of its counterpart provision in the 1935
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the framers discussed
on the floor of the Commission the proposed text of Section 16, Article VII, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>feeling was manifestly expressed to
make the power of the Commission on Appointments over presidential appointments
more limited than that held by the Commission in the 1935 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is contended by </span><u>amicus</u>

Article VII reading -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>". . .He (the President) shall <u>also</u>
appoint all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not
otherwise provided for by law and those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint
... <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" </span>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">with
particular reference to the word "also", implies that the President
shall "in like manner" appoint the officers mentioned in said second
sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the President
shall appoint the officers mentioned in said second sentence in the same manner
as he appoints officers m</span>entioned in the first sentence, that is, by
nomination and with the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on
Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Amicus</u> <u>curiae's</u> reliance on the word
"also" in said second sentence is not necessarily supportive of the
conclusion he arrives at.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the Solicitor General argues, the
word "also" could mean "in addition; as well; besides, too"
(Webster's International Dictionary, p. 62, 1981 edition) which meanings could,
on the contrary, stress that the word "also" in said second sentence
means that the President, <u>in addition to</u> nominating and, with the
consent of the Commission on Appointments, appointing the officers enumerated
in the first sentence, can appoint (without such consent (confirmation) the
officers mentioned in the second sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rather than limit the area of consideration to the possible
meanings of the word "also" <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>used in the context of said second sentence, the Court has chosen to
derive significance from the fact that the first sentence speaks of nomination
by the President and appointment by the President with the consent of the
Commission on Appointments, whereas, the second sentence speaks only of
appointment by the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, this
use of different language in two (2) sentences proximate to each other
underscores a difference in message conveyed and perceptions established, in
line with Judge Learned Hand's observation that "words are not pebbles in
alien juxtaposition" but, more so, because the recorded proceedings of the
1986 Constitutional Commission clearly and expressly justify such differences.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the innovations introduced in Sec. 16, Article VII
of the 1987 Constitution, there are officers whose appointments require no
confirmation of the Commission on Appointments, even if such officers may be
higher in rank, compared to some officers whose appointments have to be
confirmed by the Commission on Appointments under the first sentence of the
same Sec. 16, Art. VII.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, to illustrate,
the appointment of the Central Bank Governor requires no confirmation by the
Commission on Appointments, even if he is higher in rank than <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>colonel in the Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or a consul in the Consular Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">But these contrasts, while initially impressive, merely
underscore the purposive intention and deliberate judgment of the framers of
the 1987 Constitution that, except as to those officers whose appointments
require the consent of the Commission on Appointments by express mandate of the
first sentence in Sec. 16, Art. VII, appointments of other officers are left to
the President without need of confirmation by the Commission on
Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is inevitable,
if we are to presume, as we must, that the framers of the 1987 Constitution
were knowledgeable of what they were doing and of the <span class="SpellE">foreseable</span>
effects thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the power to appoint is fundamentally executive or
presidential in character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Limitations
on or qualifications of such power should be strictly construed against
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such limitations or qualifications
must be clearly stated in order to be recognized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, it is only in the first sentence of Sec.
16, Art. VII where it is clearly stated that appointments by the President to
the positions therein enumerated require the consent of the Commission on
Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fourth group of officers whom the President can
appoint, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Commission on Appointments
underscores the third sentence in Sec. 16, Article VII of the 1987
Constitution, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of other
officers lower in rank in the President <u>alone</u>, in the courts, or in the
heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards." [Emphasis
supplied].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">and argues that, since a law is needed to
vest the appointment of lower-ranked officers in the President <u>alone</u>,
this implies that, in the absence of such a law, lower-ranked officers have to
be appointed by the President subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments;
and, if this is so, as to lower-ranked officers, it follows that higher-ranked
officers should be appointed by the President, subject also to confirmation by
the Commission on Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents, on the other hand, submit that the third
sentence of Sec. 16, Article VII, <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>, merely
declares that, as to lower-ranked officers, the Congress may by law vest their
appointment in the President, in the courts, or in the heads of the various
departments, agencies, commissions, or boards in the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No reason however is submitted for the use of
the word "alone" in said third sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The Court is not
impressed by both arguments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is of
the considered opinion, after a careful study of the deliberations of the 1986
Constitutional Commission, that the use of the word "alone" after the
word "President" in said third sentence of Sec. 16, Article VII is,
more than anything else, a slip or </span><span class="SpellE"><u>lapsus</u></span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in <span class="SpellE">draftmanship</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that, in the 1935
Constitution, the following provision appears at the end of par. 3, section 10,
Article VII thereof -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ; </span>but the Congress may by law vest the appointment
of inferior officers, in the President <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">alone</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, </span>in the courts, or in the heads of
departments." [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above provision in the 1935 Constitution appears immediately
after the provision which makes practically all presidential appointments
subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, thus -</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The President shall nominate and with the
consent of the Commission on Appointments, shall appoint the heads of the
executive departments and bureaus, officers of the Army from the rank of
colonel, of the Navy and Air Forces from the rank of captain or commander, and
all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not herein provided
for, and those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint; x <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In other words, since the 1935
Constitution subjects, as a general rule, presidential appointments to
confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, the same 1935 Constitution saw
fit, by way of an exception to such rule, to provide that Congress may,
however, by law vest the appointment of inferior officers (equivalent to
"officers lower in rank" referred to in the 1987 Constitution) in the
President <u>alone</u>, in the courts, or in the heads of departments.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the 1987 Constitution, however, as already pointed out, the
clear and expressed intent of its framers was to <u>exclude</u> presidential
appointments from confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, except appointments
to offices expressly mentioned in the first sentence of Sec. 16, Article
VII.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, there was no reason
to use in the third sentence of Sec. 16, Article VII the word "alone"
after the word "President" in providing that Congress may by law vest
the appointment of lower-ranked officers in the President <u>alone</u>, or in
the courts, or in the heads of departments, because the power to appoint
officers whom he (the President) may be authorized by law to appoint is already
vested in the President, <u>without need of confirmation by the Commission <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on </span>Appointments</u>, in the second
sentence of the same Sec. 16, Article VII.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, the third sentence of Sec. 16, Article VII could have
stated merely that, in the case of lower-ranked officers, the Congress may by
law vest their appointment in the President, in the courts, or in the heads of
various departments of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the word "alone" in the third sentence of Sec. 16,
Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
a </span>literal import from the last part of par. 3, section 10, Article VII
of the 1935 Constitution, appears to be redundant in the light of the second
sentence of Sec. 16, Article VII.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And,
this redundancy cannot prevail over the clear and positive intent of the
framers of the 1987 Constitution that presidential appointments, except those
mentioned in the first sentence of Sec. 16, Article VII, are not subject to
confirmation by the Commission on Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the immediate question before the Court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">it is </span>evident that the position of
Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(a
</span>bureau head) is not one of those within the first group of appointments
where the consent of the Commission on Appointments is required.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, as already pointed out,
while the 1935 Constitution includes "heads of bureaus" among those
officers whose appointments need the consent of the Commission on Appointments,
the 1987 Constitution, on the other hand, deliberately excluded the position of
"heads of bureaus" from appointments that need the consent
(confirmation) of the Commission on Appointments.</p>

appointments are not otherwise provided for by law" and the power to
appoint such officers devolves on the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(USC, Const., Part II, p. 529, citing Op.,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">J</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">.:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The view of the respondent, as adopted by the majority opinion,
is briefly as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Confirmation is
required only for the officers mentioned in the first sentence of Section 16, to
wit, (1) the heads of the executive departments; (2) ambassadors, other public
ministers and consuls; (3) officers of the armed forces from the rank of
colonel or naval captain; and (4) other officers whose appointments are vested
in the President in the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
confirmation is required under the second sentence for (1) all other officers
whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by law, and (2) those <span class="GramE">whom</span> the President may be authorized by law to appoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither is confirmation required by the third
sentence for those other officers lower in rank whose appointment is vested by
law in the President alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following this interpretation, the Undersecretary of Foreign
Affairs, who is not the head of his department, does not have to be confirmed
by the Commission on Appointments, but the ordinary consul, who is under his
jurisdiction, must be confirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
colonel is by any standard lower in rank than the Chairman of the Commission on
Human Rights, which was created by the Constitution; yet <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>former is subject to confirmation
but the latter is not because he does not come under the first sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Special
</span>Prosecutor, whose appointment is not vested by the Constitution in the
President, is not subject to confirmation under the first sentence, and neither
are the Governor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">of </span>the Central Bank and the members of the Monetary Board
because they fall under the second sentence as interpreted by the majority <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>Yet in the case of the multi-<span class="SpellE">sectoral</span>
members of the regional consultative commission, whose appointment is vested by
the Constitution in the President under Article <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">X, </span>Section 18, their confirmation is required although their rank
is decidedly lower.</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not think these discrepancies were intended by the framers
as they would lead to the absurd consequences we should <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">avoid in interpreting </span>the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that bureau directors are not required to be
confirmed under the first sentence of Section 16, but that is not the provision
we ought to interpret.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the second
sentence we must understand for a proper resolution of the issues now before
us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, although there was a
long discussion of the first sentence in the Constitutional Commission, there
is none cited on the second sentence either in the Solicitor-General's comment
or in the majority opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We can
therefore only speculate on the correct interpretation of this provision in the
light of the first and third sentences of Section 16 or by reading this section
in its totality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The majority opinion </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">says </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that the second sentence is the exception to
the first sentence and holds that the </span>two sets of officers specified
therein may be appointed by the President without the concurrence of the
Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
interpretation is pregnant with mischievous if not also ridiculous results that
presumably were not envisioned by the framers.</p>

<p class="BODY">One may wonder why it was felt necessary to include the second
sentence at all, considering the majority opinion that the enumeration in the
first sentence of the officers subject to confirmation is exclusive on the
basis of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ex</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">pressio</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">est</span></span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span>
<span class="SpellE">alterius</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>If that be so, the
first sentence would have been sufficient by itself to convey the idea that <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">all other appointees</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>of the President would not need
confirmation.</p>

<p class="BODY">One may also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">ask </span>why, if the officers mentioned in the second sentence do not
need confirmation, it was still felt necessary to provide in the third sentence
that the appointment of the other officers lower in rank will also not need
confirmation as long as their appointment is vested by law in the President
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third sentence would appear
to be superfluous, too, again in view of the first sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY">More to the point, what will follow if Congress does not see fit
to vest in the President alone the appointment of those other officers lower in
rank mentioned in the third sentence?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Conformably to the language thereof, these lower officers will need the
confirmation of the Commission on Appointments while, by contrast, the higher
officers mentioned in the second sentence will not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, a regional director in the Department of Labor and the
labor arbiters, as officers lower in rank than the bureau director, will have
to be confirmed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">if </span>the Congress does not vest their appointment in the President
alone under the third sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, their superior, the bureau director himself, will not need to be
confirmed because, according to the majority opinion, he falls not under the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">first </span>sentence
but the second.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is carefulness in
reverse, like checking the bridesmaids but forgetting the bride.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be borne in mind that one of the purposes of the
Constitutional Commission was to restrict the powers of the Presidency and so
prevent the recurrence of another dictatorship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Among the many measures taken was the restoration of the Commission on
Appointments to check the appointing power which had been much abused by
President <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Marcos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>We are now told that even as this body
was revived to limit appointments, the scope of its original authority has
itself been limited in the new Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have to disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">My own reading is that the second sentence is but a <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">continuation</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>of the idea expressed in the first
sentence and simply mentions the other officers appointed by the President who
are also subject to confirmation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
second sentence is the later expression of the will of the framers and so must
be interpreted as complementing the rule embodied in the first sentence or, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">if </span>necessary,
reversing the original intention to exempt bureau directors from
confirmation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I repeat that there were
no debates on this matter as far as I know, which simply means that my humble
conjecture on the meaning of Section 16 is as arguable, at least, as the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">suppositions </span>of the majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We </span>read and rel<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">y</span> on the same records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
any rate, this view is more consistent with the general purpose of Article VII,
which, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>repeat, was to reduce
the powers of the Presidency.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The respondent cites the
following exchange reported </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">page 520, Volume II, of the Record of the
Constitutional Convention:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Foz</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Madam
President, this is the third proposed amendment on page 7, line 28.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I propose to put a period (.) after 'captain'
and on line 29, delete 'and all' and substitute it with HE SHALL ALSO APPOINT
ANY.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Madam
President, the Committee accepts the proposed amendment because it makes it
clear that those other officers mentioned therein do not have to be confirmed
by the Commission on Appointments.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">However, the records do not show what
particular part of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section </span>16
the committee chairman was referring to, and a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">reading in </span>its entirety of this particular debate will <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">suggest </span>that the body <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was considering the </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">first</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sentence of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the said </span>section, which I reiterate is not the controversial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In </span>any case, although the excerpt shows <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that the proposed </span>amendment of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Foz</span>
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accepted by </span>the committee,
it is not reflected, curiously <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">enough, </span>in
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">final </span>version of Section 16 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as a perusal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">thereof </span>will readily reveal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whether it was deleted later <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in
the </span>session or reworded by the style committee or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">otherwise </span>replaced for whatever reason
will need another <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">surmise </span>on
this rather confused Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">I need only add that the records
of the Constitutional Commission are merely extrinsic aids and are at best </span>persuasive
only and not necessarily conclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Interestin<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">g</span>l<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">y</span>, some quarters have observed that the Congress is not
prevented from adding to the list of officers subject to confirmation by the
Commission on Appointments and cite the debates on this matter in support of
this supposition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It </span>is true enough that there was such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>consensus, but it is equally true
that this thinking is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not at </span>all
expressed, or even only implied, in the language of Section 16 of Article
VII.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Which should prevail then - the
provision as worded or the debates?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the power of appointment is executive in
nature, but there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is no </span>question
either that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">it </span>is not absolute
or unlimited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule re-established b<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">y</span> the new Constitution is that the
power requires confirmation by the Commission on Ap<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

is the exception to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">this rule, </span>and
not the rule, that should be strictly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">construed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In my view, the only officers appointed by the President who are
not subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(1) </span>the members of the judiciary and
the Ombudsman and his deputies, who are nominated by the Judicial and Bar
Council; (2) the Vice-President when he is appointed to the Cabinet; and (3)
"other officers lower in rank," but only when their appointment is
vested by law in the President alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is clear that this enumeration does not include the respondent Commissioner of
Customs who, while not covered by the first sentence of Section 16, comes under
the second <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">sentence
</span>thereof <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>I would
interpret it and so is also subject to confirmation.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I join Justice Isagani A. Cruz in his dissent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">agree
</span>that the Constitution, as the supreme law of the land, should never have
any of its provisions interpreted in a manner that results in absurd or
irrational consequences.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Appointments is an important constitutional
body which helps <span class="GramE">give</span> fuller expression to the
principles inherent in our presidential system of government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its functions cannot be made innocuous or
unreasonably diminished to the confirmation of a limited number of
appointees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner that the
President shares in the enactment of laws which govern the nation, the
legislature, through its Commission on Appointments, gives assurance that only
those who can pass the scrutiny of both the President and Congress will help
run the country as officers holding high appointive positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third sentence of the first <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">paragraph -- </span>"x x x The Congress
may, by law, vest the appointment of other officers lower in rank in the President
alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or
boards." -- specifies only "officers lower in rank" as those who
may, by law, be appointed by the President <u>alone</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If as expounded in the majority opinion, only
the limited <span class="GramE">number of officers in the first sentence of
Section 16 require</span> confirmation, the clear intent of the third sentence
is lost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact both the second and
third sentences become meaningless or superfluous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Superfluity is not to be read into such an important
part of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">I agree </span>with the
intervenor that all provisions of the Constitution on appointments must be read
together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In providing for the
appointment of members of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts (Section
9, Article VIII), the Ombudsman and his deputies (Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">9, </span>Article
XI), the Vice President as a member of cabinet (Section 3, Article VII) and, of
course, those who by law the President alone may appoint, the Constitution
clearly provides no need for confirmation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This can only mean that all other appointments need confirmation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where there is no need for confirmation or
where there is an alternative process to confirmation, the Constitution
expressly so declares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without such a
declaration, there must be confirmation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1973 Constitution dispensed with confirmation by a Commission
on Appointments because the government it set up was supposed to be a
parliamentary one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Prime Minister,
as head of government, was constantly accountable to the legislature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In our presidential system, the
interpretation which Justice Cruz and <span class="GramE">myself</span> espouse,
is more democratic and more in keeping with the system of government organized
under the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore vote to grant the petition.</p>

normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">J</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">I </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">concur with the majority opinion and with the
concurring opinion of Justice Sarmiento, and simply wish to add my own reading
of the Constitutional provision involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section 16, Article VII, of
the 1987 Constitution provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The President shall <u>nominate</u> and, with the consent of
the Commission on Appointments, <u>appoint</u> the heads of the executive
departments, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, or officers of
the armed forces from the rank of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">colonel
or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested in him in
this Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>He shall also <u>appoint</u> all other officers of the Government
whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by law, and those whom he may
be authorized by law to appoint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of other officers
lower in rank in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of the
departments, agencies, commissions or boards.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The President shall have the power to make appointments
during the recess of the Congress, whether voluntary or compulsory, but such <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appointments</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> shall be effective only until disapproval by
the Commission on Appointments or </span>until <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the next adjournment of the Congress" (Emphasis and 1st three
paragraphings, supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">difference in language used is
significant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the first </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">sentence it is clear that the President </span>"<u>nominates</u>",
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and with the consent of the Commission
of </span>Appointments "<u>appoints</u>" the officials
enumerated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second sentence,
however, significantly uses only the <span class="GramE">term "<u>appoint</u></span>"
all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise
provided for by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law to
appoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Deliberately eliminated was any
reference to <u>nomination</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the intent of the framers of the Constitution to exclude
the appointees mentioned in the second sentence from confirmation by the
Commission on Appointments is, to my mind, quite clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So also is the fact that the term
"appoint" used in said sentence was not meant to include the three
distinct acts in the appointing process, namely, nomination, appointment, and
commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For if
that were the intent, the same terminologies in the first sentence could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">have </span>been easily employed.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There </span>should be no
question either that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">participation </span>of
the Commission on Appointments in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ap</span>pointment
process has been deliberately decreased in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">1987 Constitution </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">compared
to that in the 1935 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Constitution,
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">which required that all
presidential </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">appointments </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be with the consent of the Commission on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Appointments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The interpretation </span>given
by the majority may, indeed, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">lead to </span>some
incongruous situations as stressed in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">dissenting
opinion of Justice Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The
remedy therefor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">addresses itself to the
future.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The task of constitutional
construction </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to ascertain the
intent of the framers of </span>the Constitution and thereafter to assure its
realization (J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Land Tenure Administration, G. R.
No. 21064, February 18, 1970, 31 SCRA 413).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the primary source from which to ascertain constitutional intent is
the language of the Constitution itself.</p>

prior Congressional confirmation, thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 16.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The President shall nominate and, with the consent of the Commission on
Appointments, appoint the heads of the executive departments, ambassadors,
other public ministers and consuls, or officers of the armed forces from the
rank of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are

not otherwise provided for by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law

vest the appointment of other officers lower in rank in the President alone, in
the courts, or in the heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or <span class="GramE">boards</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The President shall have the power to make appointments during
recess of the Congress, whether voluntary or compulsory, but such appointment

<p class="BODY">By its plain language, the Constitution has intended that only those

electorate, and who, despite those "eccentricities," have stamped
their approval on that Charter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"The
Court," avers the <span class="GramE">majority,</span> "will thus
construe the applicable constitutional provisions, not in accordance with how
the executive or the legislative department may want them construed, but in
accordance with what they say and provide."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that the appointment of public officials is
essentially an exercise of executive power.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the Constitution has provided for a Commission on Appointments
does not minimize the extent of such a power, much less, make it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>shared

on the other hand, underscored the fact that while the legislature may create a
public office, it cannot name the official to discharge the functions
appurtenant thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while it may
prescribe the qualifications <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, it cannot
circumscribe such qualifications, which would unduly narrow the President's
choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that event, it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>if it is the legislature itself
conferring the appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, notwithstanding the existence of a Commission on
Appointments, the Chief Executive retains his supremacy as the appointing
authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case of doubt, the same
should be resolved in favor of the appointing power.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the essence of a republican form of government, like ours,
that "[e]ach department of the government has exclusive cognizance of
matters within its jurisdiction."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
But like all genuine republican s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">y</span>stems,
no power is absolutely separate from the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For re<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p</span>ublicanism
operates on a process of checks and balances as well, not only to guard against
excesses by one branch, but more importantly, "to secure coordination in

Viewed in that light, the Commission on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">App</span>ointments
acts as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>restraint against
abuse of the a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pp</span>ointing

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">under </span>the regime of the 1935

<p class="BODY">The system of checks and balances is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>very real sense,
the power of appointment constitutes a check against legislative

This is so, according to one authority, because "the appointments clause,
rather than 'merely dealing with etiquette or protocol,' seeks to preserve an
executive check upon legislative authority in the interest of avoiding an undue
concentration of power in Congress."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span>Accordingly, a statute conferring upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

Execution of the laws, it was held, is the concern of the President, and in
going about this business, he acts by himself or through his men and women, and
no other.</p>

Parenthetically, this represents a deviation from the rule prevailing in American

<p class="BODY">As a closing observation, I wish to clear the impression that the
1973 Constitution deliberately denied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
</span>legislature (the National Assembly under the 1971 draft Constitution)
the power to check executive appointments, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

As a delegate to, and Vice-President of, the ill-fated 1971 Constitutional
Convention, and more so <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the
presiding officer of most of its plenary sessions, I am aware that the
Convention did not provide for a commission on appointments on the theory that
the Prime Minister, the head of the Government and the sole appointing power,
was himself a member of parliament.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
this reason, there was no necessity for a separate body to scrutinize his
appointees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But should such appointees
forfeit the confidence of the assembly, they are, by tradition, required to
resign, unless they should otherwise have been removed by the Prime Minister.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
In effect, it is parliament itself that "approves" such
appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, supervening
events <span class="GramE">forestalled</span> our parliamentary experiment, and
beginning with the 1976 amendments and some 140 or so amendments thereafter, we
had reverted to the presidential form,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
without provisions for a commission on appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, while Presidential appointments, under the first
sentence of Section 16, of Article VII of the present Constitution, must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">pass </span>prior
Congressional scrutiny, it is a test that operates as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not accord
Congress any more than the power to check, but not to deny, the Chief
Executive's appointing power or to supplant his appointees with its own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is but an exception to the rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In limiting the Commission's scope of
authority, compared to that under the 1935 Constitution, I believe that the
1987 Constitution has simply recognized the reality of that exception.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the Court's decision at bar does not
mention nor deal with the Manifestation of December 1, 1987 filed by the
intervenor that Senate Bill No. 137 entitled "An Act Providing For the
Confirmation By the Commission on Appointments of All Nominations and
Appointments Made by the President of the Philippines" was passed on 23
October 1987 and was "set for perusal by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">House of Representatives." This omission has been deliberate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court has resolved the case at bar on </span>the
basis of the issues joined by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The contingency of approval of the bill mentioned by intervenor clearly
has no bearing on and cannot affect retroactively the validity of the direct
appointment of respondent Mison and other appointees similarly situated as in
G.R. No. 80071, "Alex G. Almario vs. Hon. Miriam
Defensor-Santiago.".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court does
not deal with constitutional questions in the abstract and without the same
being properly raised before it in a justiciable case and after thorough
discussion of the various points of view that would enable it to render
judgment after mature deliberation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
stressed at the hearing of <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="12">December 8,
 1987</st1:date>, any discussion of the reported bill and its validity or
invalidity is premature and irrelevant and outside the scope of the issues resolved
in the case at bar.</p>
