				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review asks us to set aside the October 29, 1982 decision of the respondent Court of Appeals, now Intermediate Appellate Court which reversed the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XL, and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint, the third party complaint, as well as the defendant's counterclaim.<br><br>The background facts which led to the filing of the instant petition are summarized in the decision of the respondent Court of Appeals:<br><br>"Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (hereinafter referred to as MWSS) is a government owned and controlled corporation created under Republic Act No. 6234 as the successor­-in-interest of the defunct NWSA.&nbsp; The Philippine National Bank (PNB for short), on the other hand, is the depository bank of MWSS and is predecessor-in-interest NWSA.&nbsp; Among the several accounts of NWSA with PNB is NWSA Account No. 6, otherwise known as Account No. 381-777 and which is presently allocated No. 010-500281.&nbsp; The authorized signature for said Account No. 6 were those of MWSS treasurer Jose Sanchez, its auditor Pedro Aguilar, and its acting General Manager Victor L. Recio.&nbsp; Their respective specimen signatures were submitted by the MWSS to and on file with the PNB.&nbsp; By special arrangement with the PNB, the MWSS used personalized checks in drawing from this account.&nbsp; These checks were printed for MWSS by its printer, F. Mesina Enterprises, located at 1775 Rizal Extension, Caloocan City.<br><blockquote>"During the months of March, April and May 1969, twenty-three (23) checks were prepared, processed, issued and released by NWSA, all of which were paid and cleared by PNB and debited by PNB against NWSA Account No. 6, to wit:<br><br><table  ="" width="90%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="16%"><div align="justify">Check No.</div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="center">Date</div></td> <td width="26%"><div align="justify">Payee</div></td> <td width="21%"><div align="right">Amount</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">Date Paid&nbsp;&nbsp; By PNB</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">1. 59546</div></td> <td><div align="center">8-21-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Deogracias Estrella</div></td> <td><div align="right">P 3,187.79</div></td> <td><div align="right">4-2-69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2. 59548</div></td> <td><div align="center">3-31-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Natividad Rosario</div></td> <td><div align="right">2,848.86</div></td> <td><div align="right">4-23-69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">3. 59547</div></td> <td><div align="center">3-31-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Pangilinan Enterprises</div></td> <td><div align="right">195.00</div></td> <td><div align="right">Unreleased</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">4. 59549</div></td> <td><div align="center">3-31-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Natividad Rosario</div></td> <td><div align="right">3,239.88</div></td> <td><div align="right">4-23-69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">5. 59552</div></td> <td><div align="center">4 -1-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Villarama &amp; Sons</div></td> <td><div align="right">987.59</div></td> <td><div align="right">5 -6-69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">6. 59554</div></td> <td><div align="center">4 -1-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Gascom Engineering</div></td> <td><div align="right">6,057.60</div></td> <td><div align="right">4-16-69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">7. 59558</div></td> <td><div align="center">4 -2-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The Evening News</div></td> <td><div align="right">112.00</div></td> <td><div align="right">Unreleased</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">8. 59544</div></td> <td><div align="center">3-27-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Progressive Const.</div></td> <td><div align="right">18,391.20</div></td> <td><div align="right">4-18-69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">9. 59564</div></td> <td><div align="center">4 -2-69</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Ind.

Bank Clearing, these checks were presented for payment by PBC and PCIB to the defendant PNB, and paid, also in the months of March, April and May 1969.&nbsp; At the time of their presentation to PNB these checks bear the standard indorsement which reads 'all prior indorsement and/or lack of endorsement guaranteed.'<br><br>"Subsequent investigation however, conducted by the NBI showed that Raul Dizon, Arturo Sison and Antonio Mendoza were all fictitious persons.&nbsp; The respective balances in their current account with the PBC and/or PCIB stood as follows:&nbsp; Raul Dizon P3,455.00 as of April 30, 1969; Antonio Mendoza P18,182.00 as of May 23, 1969; and Arturo Sison P1,398.92 as of June 30, 1969.<br><br>"On June 11, 1969, NWSA addressed a letter to PNB requesting the immediate

signatures of authorized NWSA signing officers and there was nothing on its face that could have aroused any suspicion as to its genuineness and due execution and; that NWSA was guilty of negligence which was the proximate cause of the loss.<br><br>“PNB also filed a third party complaint against the negotiating banks PBC and PCIB on the ground they failed to ascertain the identity of the payees

negotiable instrument is deemed prima facie to have been issued for valuable consideration and every person whose signature appears thereon to have become a party thereto for value."</blockquote>The petitioner submits that the above provision does not apply to the facts of the instant case because the questioned checks were not those of the MWSS and neither were they drawn by its authorized signatories.&nbsp; The petitioner states that granting that Section 24 of the Negotiable Instruments Law is applicable, the same creates only a prima facie presumption which was overcome by the following documents, to wit:&nbsp; (1) the NBI Report of November 2, 1970; (2) the NBI Report of November 21, 1974; (3) the NBI Chemistry Report No. C-74-891; (4) the Memorandum of Mr. Juan Diño, 3rd Assistant Auditor of the respondent drawee bank addres­sed to the Chief Auditor of the petitioner; (5) the admission of the respondent bank's counsel in open court that the National Bureau of Investigation found the signature on the twenty-three (23) checks in question to be forgeries; and (6) the admission of the respondent bank's witness, Mr. Faustino Mesina, Jr. that the checks in question were not printed by his printing press.&nbsp; The petitioner contends that since the signatures on the checks were forgeries, the respondent drawee bank must bear the loss under the rulings of this Court:<br><blockquote>"A bank is bound to know the signatures of its customers; and if it pays a forged check it must be considered as making the pay­ment out of its own funds, and cannot ordinarily charge the amount so paid to the account of the depo­sitor whose name was forged."<br><div style="text-align: center;"><br></div><div style="text-align:

(<i>San Carlos Milling Co. v.

(<i>Great Eastern Life Ins. Co. v. Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank,</i> 43 Phil. 678).</blockquote>We have carefully reviewed the documents cited by the petitioner.&nbsp; There is no express and categorical finding in these documents that the twenty-three (23) questioned checks were indeed signed by persons other than the authorized MWSS signatories.&nbsp; On the contrary, the findings of the National Bureau of Investigation in its Report dated November 2, 1970 show that the MWSS fraud was an "inside job" and that the petitioner's delay in the reconciliation of bank statements and the laxity and loose records control in the printing of its personalized checks facilitated the fraud.&nbsp; Likewise, the questioned Documents Report No. 159-1074 dated November 21, 1974 of the National Bureau of Investigation does not declare or prove that the signatures appearing on the questioned checks are forgeries.&nbsp; The report merely mentions the alleged differences in the typeface, checkwriting, and printing characteristics appearing in the standard or submitted models and the questioned typewritings.&nbsp; The NBI Chemistry Report No. C-74-891 merely describes the inks and pens used in writ­ing the alleged forged signatures.<br><br>It is clear that these three (3) NBI Reports relied upon by the petitioner are inadequate to sustain its allegations of forgery.&nbsp; These reports did not touch on the inherent qualities of the signatures which are indispensable in the determination of the existence of forgery.&nbsp; There must be conclusive findings that there is a variance in the inherent characteristics of the signatures and that they were written by two or more different persons.<br><br>Forgery cannot be presumed (<i>Siasat, et al. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al, </i>139 SCRA 238).&nbsp; It must be established by clear, positive, and convinc­ing evidence.&nbsp; This was not done in the present case.<br><br>The cases of <i>San Carlos Milling Co. Ltd. v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, et al</i>. (59 Phil. 59) and Great Eastern Life Ins., Co. v. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (43 Phil. 678) relied upon by the petitioner are inapplicable in this case because the forgeries in those cases were either clearly established or admitted while in the instant case, the allegations of forgery were not clearly established during trial.<br><br>Considering the absence of sufficient security in the printing of the checks coupled with the very close similarities between the genuine signatures and the alleged forgeries, the twenty-three (23) checks in question could have been presented to the petitioner's signatories without their knowing that they were bogus checks.&nbsp; Indeed, the cashier of the petitioner whose signatures were allegedly forged was unable to tell the difference between the allegedly forged signature and his own genuine signature.&nbsp; On the other hand, the MWSS officials admitted that these checks could easily be passed on as genuine.<br><br>The memorandum of Mr. A. T. Tolentino, Assistant Chief Accountant of the drawee Philippine National Bank to Mr. E. Villatuya, Executive Vice-President of the petitioner dated June 9, 1969 cites an instance where even the concerned NWSA officials could not tell the difference between the genuine checks and the alleged forged checks:<br><blockquote>"At about 12:00 o'clock on June 6, 1969, VP Maramag requested me to see him in his office at the Cashier's Dept. where Messrs. Jose M. Sanchez, treasurer of NAWASA and Romeo Oliva of the same office were present.&nbsp; Upon my arrival I observed the NAWASA officials questioning the issue of the NAWASA checks appearing in their own list, xerox copy attached.<br><br>"For verification purposes, therefore, the checks were taken from our file.&nbsp; To everybody there present namely VP Maramag, the two abovementioned NAWASA officials, AVP Buhain, Asst. Cashier Castelo, Asst. Cashier Tejada and Messrs. A. Lopez and L. Lechuga, both C/A bookkeepers, no one was able to point out any difference on the signatures of the NAWASA officials appearing on the checks compared to their official signatures on file.&nbsp; In fact 3 checks, one of those under question, were presented to the NAWASA treasurer for verification but he could not point out which was his genuine signature.&nbsp; After intent comparison, he pointed on the questioned check as bearing his correct signature."</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>Moreover, the petitioner is barred from setting up the defense of forgery under Section 23 of the Negotia­ble Instruments Law which provides that:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 23. - FORGED SIGNATURE; EFFECT OF. - When the signature is forged or made without authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, it is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument, or to give a discharge therefor, or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto can be acquired through or under such signature unless the party against whom it is sought to enforce such right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority."</blockquote>because it was guilty of negligence not only before the questioned checks were negotiated but even after the same had already been negotiated.&nbsp; (See <i>Republic v.

Court of Appeals</i> (25 SCRA 693) that:<br><blockquote>"Thus, by not returning the check to the PCIB, by thereby indicating that the PNB had found nothing wrong with the check and would honor the same, and by actually paying its amount to the PCIB, the PNB induced the latter, not only to believe that the check was genuine and good in every respect, but, also, to pay its amount to Augusto Lim.&nbsp; In other words, the PNB was the primary or proximate cause of the loss, and, hence, may not recover from the PCIB."</blockquote>The argument has no merit.&nbsp; The records show that the respondent drawee bank, had taken the necessary measures in the detection of forged checks and the prevention of their fraudulent encashment.&nbsp; In fact, long before the encashment of the twenty-three (23) checks in question, the respondent Bank had issued constant reminders to all Current Account Bookkeepers informing them of the activities of forgery syndicates.&nbsp; The Memorandum of the Assistant Vice-President and Chief Accountant of the Philippine National Bank dated February 17, 1966 reads in part:<br><center><br>"SUBJECT:&nbsp; <i>ACTIVITIES OF FORGERY SYNDICATE</i><br></center><blockquote>"From reliable information we have gathered that personalized checks of current account depositors are now the target of the forgery syndicate.&nbsp; To protect the interest of the bank, you are hereby enjoined to be more careful in examining said checks especially those coming from the clearing, mails and window transactions.&nbsp; As a reminder please be guided with the following:<br><blockquote>“1. Signatures of drawers should be properly scrutinized and compared with those we have on file.<br><br>“2. The serial numbers of the checks should be compared with the serial numbers registered with the Cashier's Dept.<br><br>“3. The texture of the paper used and the printing of the checks should be com­pared with the sample we have on file with the Cashier's Dept.<br><br>“4. Checks bearing several indorsements should be given a special attention.<br><br>“5. Alteration in amount both in figures and words should be carefully examined even if signed by the drawer.<br><br>“6. Checks issued in substantial amounts particularly by depositors who do not usually issue checks in big amounts should be brought to the attention of the drawer by telephone or any fastest means of communication for purposes of confirmation.<br></blockquote>and your attention is also invited to keep abreast of previous circulars and memo instructions issued to bookkeepers."</blockquote>We cannot fault the respondent drawee Bank for not having detected the fraudulent encashment of the checks because the printing of the petitioner's personalized checks was not done under the supervision and control of the Bank.&nbsp; There is no evidence on record indicating that because of this private printing, the petitioner furnished the respondent Bank with samples of checks, pens, and inks or took other precautionary measures with the PNB to safeguard its interests.<br><br>Under the circumstances, therefore, the petitioner was in a better position to detect and prevent the fraudulent encashment of its checks.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on certiorari is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.&nbsp; The decision of the respondent Court of Appeals dated October 29, 1982 is AFFIRMED.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Feria, (Chairman), Fernan, Alampay,</i> and <i>Cruz, JJ., </i>concur.<br><i>Paras, J.,</i> no part.<br></div>
