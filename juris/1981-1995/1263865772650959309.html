				<H3>NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, CONCEPCION S. SALONGA, BENJAMIN SALONGA, ANNETTE S. PASTORAL, JOY ANN S. PASTORAL (REPRESENTED BY THEIR PARENTS BENJAMIN C. PASTORAL AND ERLINDA S. PASTORAL) AND MARILOU VELISANO (REPRESENTED BY HER PARENTS CARMELITA VELISANO AND GABRIEL VELISANO), RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">As found by the respondent court, the facts of this case are
simple.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three young ladies, Annette Pastoral, Joy Ann Pastoral, and <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Velisano</span>, who are among
the private respondents herein, were gifted on their graduation with their
first trip abroad, to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>
and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
by their parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accompanied by their
grandmother, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>,
they flew on <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1978</st1:date>,
to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, where they were to await their plane
tickets for the rest of their trip.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1978</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Pastoral and her uncle, <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, went to the office of the petitioner's
agent, the Inter-Pacific Transit, Inc., in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to purchase the said tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They paid
the computed total price of P25,100.40 in the afternoon of that same day and
were assured that the tickets would be delivered to the passengers in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> in time for their flight to Japan the following
day.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> office of the Northwest
Orient Airlines found, however, that ITI had made a mistake in the computation
of the price of the tickets - in fact, two mistakes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That office first sent a telex to the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
office that the wrong conversion rates of exchange had been used and that there
was a deficit of $160.70 for each ticket.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then a second telex advised that the 10% mileage surcharge had not been
paid, which meant that the revised additional charge should be further
increased to $261.60 per ticket.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of these errors, the NOA office in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> refused to release the prepaid tickets to the four
passengers when Annette Pastoral and <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Velisano</span> came to claim them on <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were told they had to pay the additional fare of $261.60 per
ticket.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The girls requested the NOA
personnel to check with their <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> office, but this
request was arrogantly rejected in the presence of many persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the flight was scheduled at <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> that same afternoon, the girls had
no choice but to pay the total differential fare of $1,046.40.</p>

<p class="BODY">That unexpected expense depleted their foreign currency and
caused them a great deal of tension and inconvenience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had to stay in a cheap hotel in <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>,
with all four of them occupying only one room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> got sick.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 69-year old <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
who had a heart condition, fretted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Frantic and worried over their dwindling funds, the girls called up
their parents for assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
grandfather, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, finally decided to fly
to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
join them, incurring additional expenses for this purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1979</st1:date>,
the private respondents sued the petitioner and ITI for breach of contract and
damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial, judgment was
rendered for the plaintiffs and the defendants were jointly and severally
required:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To pay unto the
plaintiffs the expenses of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> only which should be less
than P5,000.00 to include actual fare and incidental expenses of travel;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To pay moral damages
for physical sufferings, mental anguish, serious anxiety and humiliation in the
amount of P400,000.00 incurred by each passenger;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To pay exemplary
damages unto plaintiffs in the breach of contract and a public duty as a
carrier P200,000.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To pay for and as
attorney's fees P80,000.00 for having failed to honor immediately plaintiffs'
just and lawful demand thus compelling plaintiffs to go to court; and to pay
the costs of the proceedings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On its motion for reconsideration, however, ITI was absolved of
liability as a mere agent of the petitioner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the findings of the trial court were sustained by the
respondent court which, however, modified the decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is modified by ordering the
defendant Northwest Orient Airlines to pay P50,000.00 to each passenger as
moral damages, P10,000.00 each to the passengers as exemplary damages and
P50,000.00 as attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The award of P5,000.00 to Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>
is eliminated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Costs against the appellant Northwest Orient Airlines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner now challenges this ruling on the ground that
there is no factual or legal basis for the award to the plaintiffs of the moral
and exemplary damages, and neither are the attorney's fees justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it now concedes that it was negligent
in computing the correct fare, it insists it had not acted in bad faith or with
malice, to warrant the said awards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule, indeed, is that even if there is a breach of contract,
as admitted in this case, moral damages are nevertheless not justified where
only simple negligence can be imputed to the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In China Airlines v. Intermediate Appellate Court,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
we held as follows:</p>

<blockquote>With respect to moral damages, the rule is that the same are
recoverable in a damage suit predicated upon a breach of contract of carriage
only where (1) the mishap results in the death of a passenger and (2) it is
proved that the carrier was guilty of fraud or bad faith, even if death does
not result.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the present case does not
fall under either of the cited instances, the award of moral damages should be,
as it is hereby disallowed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And only recently, Sabena Belgian World v. Court of Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
affirmed the doctrine that:</p>

<blockquote>In cases of breach of contract, moral damages can be awarded only where
the defendant has acted fraudulently or in bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere negligence, even if thereby the
plaintiff suffers mental anguish or serious fright is not ground for awarding
moral damages.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, the finding of the trial court in the case at bar is that
the petitioner should not be faulted with mere negligence that would absolve it
from damages for its breach of contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rejecting its defense of good faith, Judge Rafael de la Cruz observed:</p>

<blockquote>To evade liability good faith is being claimed by the defendants in
the performance of their part of the obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts adduced from the pleadings and the
records, to our mind, are not sufficient to make good faith the thinly veiled
excuse for justification because as aptly said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“A contract to transport passengers is quite different in kind and
degree from any other contractual relations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And this is so because of the relation which an air carrier sustains
with the public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its business is mainly
with the traveling public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It invites
people to avail of the comfort and advantages it offers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract of air carriage therefore
generates a relation attended with public duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neglect or malfeasance of the carriers’ employees, naturally, could give
ground for an action for damages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note first the error upon error committed by the petitioner's
agent in computing the passengers’ fare, a task with which it was not exactly
unfamiliar, being experienced in the travel business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That negligence imposed needless burden on
the passengers who had gone on their trip, the first abroad for the three
girls, precisely to enjoy themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, the negligence, which was strange enough as it was, was not the
only vexation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On top of this annoyance
was the manner in which the petitioner's personnel in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
sought to rectify the supposed mistakes of its <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was far from acceptable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's employees should have been at least polite if
not even sympathetic and apologetic to the two young girls in the foreign
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead they were overbearing and
hostile, forgetting that they were dealing not with bothersome persons begging
for a free ride.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The girls were
respectable passengers who had in fact paid for their tickets in advance in the
exact amount computed by the petitioner's own agent in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Annette Pastoral and <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Velisano</span> testified that they were treated coldly and
arrogantly by the NOA <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were flatly told their tickets would not
be released unless the additional charge was paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were humiliated when their request to
contact the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> office by telex was haughtily
rejected in the presence and within hearing of other persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were not accorded the courtesy due them
even only as ordinary individuals if not, indeed, as pre-paid passengers.</p>

<p class="BODY">We accept the findings of the lower courts in this regard, absent
a clear showing that they were arbitrarily reached.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied with the evidence that the
petitioner's personnel in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> were less than
polite to the two young ladies who, it must be added, had not provoked any
boorishness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And we also agree with the
following observation of the respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>We find no merit in the contention of appellant NOA that no
coercion or threat or force (was) used on the passengers in the payment of the
additional amount of $261.00 from each passenger.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The worries and anxiety of the plaintiffs passengers started when
the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> office of NOA refused to issue their
tickets for the rest of their trip to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There may be no threat with physical sense but the mere fact of the
refusal of defendant's office in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> to issue
the pre-paid tickets was enough tension as they could be stranded in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> with meager funds.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The cavalier treatment of the two girls at the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> NOA office requires a brief comment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court feels it is about time foreigners
realized that Filipinos, whatever their station in life, are entitled to the
same civility accorded other persons when they are in an alien land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot be dismissed or disdained on the
basis of our nationality, which is as proud and as respectable as any other on
this earth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The haughty attitude of some
foreigners who seem to think they belong to a superior race has irked not a few
Filipino travelers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let it be stressed
to our credit that we are not impressed at all by such self-importance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Airlines should especially advise their
personnel against superciliousness when dealing with citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and are cautioned that this Court will not countenance that kind of conduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the acts of the petitioner, assessed in their
totality, constituted more than mere negligence and assumed the dimensions of
bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was clear malice here,
manifested in the contemptuous disregard of the passenger's protest and the
abrupt rejection of their request that the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> office
be contacted for verification of the correct billing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rudeness is never excusable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is especially condemnable if it is
committed in one's own country against a foreign guest, as in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not correct to say that moral damages are not due <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> and Joy Ann
Pastoral because they had not testified on the effects of the petitioner's acts
upon them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other two girls took the
stand to describe their common experiences and reactions and were later
corroborated by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their testimonies were enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is true that we denied moral damages to
the plaintiff in Francisco v. GSIS,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
because she failed to testify as to her social humiliation, wounded feelings
and anxiety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that case, however,
there was absolutely no evidence in this respect from her or from any other
source, let alone the fact that bad faith had also not been proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">But we do agree that the amount awarded in the present case is
rather steep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hereby reduce it to
P10,000.00 for each of the four passengers plus another P10,000.00 each for
Annette Pastoral and <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Velisano</span>
for their humiliation at the NOA <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> office.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the award of exemplary damages, to deter the petitioner
and other airlines from the commission of the acts complained of by the private
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Airlines should always bear
in mind the special responsibilities they owe their passengers not only of
carrying them safely and comfortably according to their contracts but also of
extending to them the courtesy due them in all matters relating to their trip,
including reservations, confirmation of bookings, ticketing and other ground
and in-flight services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fare of the
passenger includes payment for politeness.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of our findings regarding the <span class="SpellE"><u>mala</u></span><u>
fides</u> of the petitioner, we also approve the award of attorney's fees but
reduce it in our discretion to P20,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification of the amount of the
moral damages and of the attorney's fees as above indicated, the appealed
decision of the respondent court is AFFIRMED, with costs against the
petitioner.</p>
