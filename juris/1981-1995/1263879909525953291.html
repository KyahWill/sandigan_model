<p class="BODY">The respondent, presently a <span class="SpellE">practising</span>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">In </span>Administrative
Case No.</span> R-94-RTJ, the pertinent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">A letter-complaint dated February 2, 1984 (Exhibit 7) was filed
with the then Ministry of Justice (now Department of Justice) by Governor
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> of the Province of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> and Regional Director of the National Intelligence
&amp; Security Authority (NISA), Region XII for irregularities allegedly
committed by the respondent in connection with Criminal Case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:27.0pt">No. </span>1247 (later docketed as Criminal
Case No. 267) entitled "People v. Joseph <span class="SpellE">Embalsado</span>",
for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act which was then pending before his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
letter-complaint stated, among others, that the respondent tried to extort
money from the parents of the accused in Criminal Case No. 267 in the amount of
P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in consideration of a favorable judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the said letter-complaint was forwarded to us, we resolved,
on <st1:date year="1984" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1984</st1:date>, to refer
the case to the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation for investigation,

Case No. 267 filed, on May 21, 1984, a motion to inhibit Presiding Judge (<span class="SpellE">Tablang</span>) from conducting further trial (Exhibit
"B") on the ground that the said judge could not be expected to
display and exercise objectivity, fairness and justice in conducting further
trial inasmuch as he had attempted to extort and demand money from the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> parents in exchange for a judgment in favor of
the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearing on the motion to inhibit set on <st1:date year="1984" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1984</st1:date>, both the father and the

counsel for the accused in Criminal Case No. 267 who stated that after he
learned of the respondent's deplorable acts of extortion from his client's

was expecting the head of complainant, Gov. Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>,
to file a similar motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>which
the said counsel could base his own motion to inhibit and that when the said

of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> since March 1986 who, in his
testimony, made the assessment that the respondent is an exemplary public
servant whose candor had incurred the ire of some people including those
connected with the complainant; and the respondent judge himself who insisted

a businessman in <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, who testified that he owned
the truck which was used to transport the cows of the complainant upon the
respondent's orders and which truck was apprehended by the police in <span class="SpellE">Marbel</span>, South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> pursuant
to the Court of Appeals' order to return the said cows to the complainant; Colonel
<span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sua</span>, Commanding
Officer of the 38th Infantry Battalion stationed at Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>
who said in open court that sometime in October 1986, the respondent requested
for the detail of some of his soldiers to assist the sheriff in the
implementation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the orders
regarding the complainant's case and that the respondent's request was not
granted in view of the Court of Appeals' order not warranting implementation
thereof; and Jose <span class="SpellE">Jonald</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagon</span>,
the complainant's son who recounted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">how
</span>the respondent drew gasoline from his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">gas </span>station on a credit basis and how the complainant informed
him that the gasoline taken was for the complainant's account.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the respondent, six witnesses gave their testimonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were Judge Herman <span class="SpellE">Malcampo</span>
who attested to the correctness of the certificate he issued when he was acting
Register of Deeds to the effect that the respondent had no real properties in
Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>; Luisa de Peralta, provincial budget
officer of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> who presented and testified
on the photocopies of the different appropriations for the respondent's <span class="SpellE">sala</span> for 1985; Lydia <span class="SpellE">Gepte</span>,
provincial assessor of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> who declared
that there was no property in the name of the respondent as per records of the
province of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> covering the period from
1983 to November 1986; Vicente Miguel, chief accountant of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> who stated that he prepared the statement of
gasoline expenses of the respondent from January 1984 to December 1986; <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> an employee of the
Commission on Audit, Office of the Provincial Assessor, Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> who pointed out in his testimony the different
instances when <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Solitario</span>,
the respondent's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">OIC, </span>had been
short of funds with respect to his cash accountability and the <span class="SpellE">deficiences</span> in <span class="SpellE">Solitario's</span>
management of the funds for which he was accountable; and the respondent
himself who denied the charges against him indicating how stupid and groundless
they were on account of his being a respectable and distinguished member of the
judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">After weighing all the evidence submitted before him, Justice <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>Investigating
Officer, made a finding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>AM
No. RTJ-86-24 that the respondent's acts were constitutive of serious
misconduct whereby no amount of character <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">evidence
</span>could exonerate the respondent inasmuch as the testimonies for the
complainant were given in a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">straightforward
manner </span>without an indication of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">any
ill </span>motive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>their part
to falsely testify against the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, with respect to the charge that the respondent demanded
and received sacks of rice, tires and goats from the complainant, the
Investigating Officer found no sufficient evidence to substantiate the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the additional
allegations referring to the previous charges <span class="SpellE">levelled</span>
against the respondent as per NBI records were disregarded by Justice <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span> in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">de</span>termination
of the merits of this case for lack of evidence.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After reviewing the records of these cases, we arrive at the
conclusion that the reports prepared by the Investigating Officer do not leave
anything to be <span class="GramE">desired,</span> hence, we share his view that
the evidence of guilt against the respondent is crystal clear and extremely
strong.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once again, we find this case an occasion to remind the members
of the Judiciary:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
so conduct themselves as to be beyond reproach and suspicion, and be free from
any appearance of impropriety in their personal behavior not only in the
discharge of their official duties but also in their everyday life, for as we
have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">earlier </span>stressed, ‘no
position exacts a greater demand on moral righteousness and uprightness of an
individual than a seat in the Judiciary’ so that (a) magistrate of the law must
comport himself at all times in such a manner that his conduct, official or
otherwise, can bear the most searching scrutiny of the public that looks up to
him as the epitome of integrity and justice.’” (Association of Court Employees
of <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span> <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>, 175 SCRA 292 [1989] citing <span class="SpellE">Dia-Anonuevo</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Bercacio</span>, 68 SCRA 81; Quiz v. <span class="SpellE">Castaño</span>,
107 SCRA 196; <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> <span class="SpellE">Abano</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>, 107 SCRA 538; and Cabrera v. <span class="SpellE">Pajares</span>, 142 SCRA 127)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as correctly stated by the Investigating Officer, the
mere denials <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>unsatisfactory
refutations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the part of the
respondent as regards the charges against him coupled with an attempt to
bolster his claim that he is innocent through evidence of his good character
cannot persuade us to disregard the finding of guilt inasmuch as the evidence
on record indubitably shows that the respondent's acts amounted to se<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">r</span>ious misconduct warranting his
dismissal from office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the respondent
were still a Judge, he would have been dismissed with prejudice to re?employment
in the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>government service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, since the respondent had already
been removed from office upon acceptance of his courtesy resignation in 1987,
we deem it appropriate under the circumstances to mete out the penalty of
forfeiture of any and all retirement and separation benefits and privileges to
which the respondent may be entitled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence adduced in the records is likewise adequate to
sustain the complaint for disbarment and to bar the respondent from the
practice of law before all courts of justice and all administrative agencies
where membership in the Bar is a requisite for practice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, this Court, on a clear finding
of guilt gleaned from the records, hereby ORDERS that all retirement and
separation benefits and privileges to which the respondent may be entitled be
forfeited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This penalty carries with it
prejudice against re-employment in the government service including
government-owned or controlled corporations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent is further barred from the practice of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Clerk of Court is ordered to properly
disseminate the order of DISBARMENT and to furnish the Secretary of Justice a
copy of the decision to study whether or not appropriate criminal charges may
be filed against him.</p>
