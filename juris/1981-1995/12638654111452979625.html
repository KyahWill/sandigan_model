				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In a Decision, dated </span><st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="11"><span style="">12
 November 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">, this
Court, upon finding that respondent Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
had "proven himself unfit to continue in the pursuit of his
profession," ordered his disbarment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> thereafter sought a reconsideration of the said
Resolution on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="12"><span style="">14 December 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was denied </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="1"><span style="">12 January 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> for lack of merit, the issues raised having
previously been duly considered and passed upon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Undaunted, respondent
filed, on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="2"><span style="">10 February 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> a "Petition for Redress and Exoneration
and for Voluntary Inhibition," praying that the decision of </span><st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="11"><span style="">12
 November 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">, and
the resolution of the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration of the said
decision be set aside and a new one entered dismissing the administrative
complaint and exonerating him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We denied his plea in a
Resolution, dated 15 March 1988, it being in the nature of a second Motion for
Reconsideration filed without leave of court, besides the fact that the first
Motion for Reconsideration filed by him had already been denied with finality
on January 12, 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This notwithstanding,
respondent filed another Motion </span>requesting an <span style="">extension of time to file a Motion for Reconsideration, this time, of
the Resolution of 15 March 1988 simultaneously praying that the Bar Confidant
furnish him with a certified true copy of the Solicitor General's Report and
Recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These requests were
denied in the Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="5"><span style="">5 May 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Seven months later, or on
</span><st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="12"><span style="">29 December 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent, through counsel, filed a "Petition for Reinstatement
as a Member of the Bar," this time praying for "justice, leniency,
understanding and mercy from the Members of this Honorable Court," citing
several cases of lawyers previously disbarred but who were eventually
reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent averred that he
comes to court "on bended knees asking for the same kindness,
understanding, liberality and leniency."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This was once again
denied in the Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="6"><span style="">15 June 1989</span></st1:date><span style=""> the same being substantially a repetition of
the Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision of </span><st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="11"><span style="">12 November 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was already denied with finality in
the Resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="1"><span style="">12 January 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span><span style="">"Motion for Leave to File Testimonials
to Support Petition for Reinstatement" was filed on 11 May 1989 which
Motion was accompanied by various testimonials from prominent members of the
Bar urging the Court to grant his plea for reinstatement, which the Court Noted
in its Resolution of 30 May 1989.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Unrelenting in his
efforts, respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>, on </span><st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="7"><span style="">13 July
 1989</span></st1:date><span style="">, filed a
"Motion for Reconsideration of Resolution Denying Petition for
Reinstatement." Varying the tenor of his previous submissions, respondent
in this instance:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> begs to apologize to this Honorable Supreme
Court for repeating in his petition for reinstatement what he already alleged
in his Motion for reconsideration of the decision of this Honorable Court dated
12 November 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The repetition was due
to his confused state of mind caused by the tremendous impact of the denial of
his motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To rectify the error committed, and with the kind permission and
leave of this Honorable Court, respondent is hereby openly and unequivocally
retracting, withdrawing and abandoning all the statements and arguments of and
allusions and references to, the previously denied motion for reconsideration
which have been alleged or used in his petition for reinstatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In consequence, respondent respectfully prays that this Honorable
Court ignore them and treat the petition for reinstatement of respondent as one
limited to, and mainly and exclusively predicated <span style="">on </span>his plea for leniency, understanding, liberality, mercy and
judicial clemency."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Unmoved, we denied the
motion with finality in our Resolution </span>of <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="10"><span style="">19 October 1989</span></st1:date><span style=""> there being no compelling reason raised to
warrant reconsideration of the questioned Resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 24 November 1989,
respondent filed a "Motion for Permission to Reiterate his Petition for
Reinstatement" stating that he humbly begs </span>permission to <span style="">plead again for its forgiveness and clemency;
that he has suffered the harsh and supreme sanction of disbarment for two long
years now; that this is his first offense; that he solemnly declares that he
has fully realized his mistake and the gravity of his offense for which he is
fully repentant and learned the most bitter lesson of his life to such an
extent that he solemnly vows never to commit any offense again; that his
sufferance of the extreme sanction of disbarment has changed him for the
better; that he had fully purged himself in the proper and irreproachable
manner and that he prays that he be forgiven and pardoned by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Motion was denied with finality in the
Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="12"><span style="">21 December 1989</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 21 May 1990, Mrs.
Maria Luisa B. <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>, wife of respondent wrote a
letter addressed to the Chief Justice and Associate Justices </span>of <span style="">this Court stating that she has long wanted
to write and if it need be, on bended knees, to ask the Court sincerely to
forgive her husband and permit him to practice his profession; that it is not
only he who is suffering the anguish and shame caused by his disbarment but
also his children and herself; that it is now two and a half (2 1/2) years
since her husband has been disbarred and completely </span><span style="">without </span><span style="">any means to support his family; that their youngest daughter may
altogether have to stop studying; that during these years, her husband has
deeply repented and is now very humble and prayerful and has reformed for the
better and that she pleads that her husband be forgiven and reinstated as a
lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter was <span class="GramE">Noted</span> for the time being in the Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="6"><span style="">28 June
 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 17 October 1990, the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Chapter of the Integrated Bar, submitted to the
Bar Confidant for the Court's consideration, Resolution No. 90-057, adopted on
9 October 1990, praying that the Court extend its judicial clemency to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> and reinstate him as a member of
the Philippine Bar, </span><span style="">reasoning
among others, </span><span style="">that he has been
“sufficiently punished,” has reformed and rehabilitated himself, and can </span>again
<span style="">be entrusted with the exercise of the
noble profession of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>a <span style="">letter, dated </span><st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="11"><span style="">21 November 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, addressed to the Chief Justice and
Associate Justices of the Court respondent <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
pleaded anew that once the Court restores him to the practice of law, he
"unreservedly bind(s)" himself "henceforth to act and behave
carefully as a worthy member of the Philippine Bar."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Without overlooking the
charge which caused respondent's disbarment, reinstatement may now </span>be <span style="">warranted, predicated on the following
objective and criterion:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The sole object of the Court upon an application <span style="">for </span>reinstatement to practice, by one
previously disbarred, is to determine whether <span style="">or </span>not the applicant has satisfied and convinced the Court by
positive evidence that the effort he has made toward the rehabilitation of his
character has been successful, and, therefore, he is entitled to be re-admitted
to a profession which is intrinsically an office of trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(In Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rusiana</span>, Adm. Case
No. 270, 29 March 1974, 56 SCRA 240).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The criterion for reinstatement has been stated as <span style="">follows:</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the applicant shall be
reinstated rests to a great extent in the sound discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court action will depend, generally
speaking, on whether or not it decides that the public interest in the orderly
and impartial administration of justice will be conserved by the applicant's
participation therein in the capacity of an attorney and counselor at law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicant must, like a candidate for
admission to the Bar, satisfy the Court that he is a person of good moral
character---a fit and proper person to practice <span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The Court will take
into consideration the applicant's character and standing prior to the
disbarment, the nature and character of the charge for which he was disbarred,
his conduct subsequent to the disbarment, and the time that has elapsed between
the disbarment and the application for reinstatement." (5 Am. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Jur</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span>
Sec. 301, p. 443, cited in <span class="SpellE">In</span> Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan T. <span class="SpellE">Publico</span>, <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1981</st1:date>, 102 SCRA 721).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The testimonials
submitted in respondent's favor are from well-respected and prominent members
of the legal community namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Former
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court </span><span class="SpellE">Querube</span> <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, Senate President <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>

1975-1977), Manuel T. Molina and <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> P. Peralta,
President of the Capitol Bar <span style="">Association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All their testimonials attest to respondent's
good moral character and to the fact that he has mended his ways towards the
rehabilitation of his character such that </span>his reinstatement "will
not only be an act of compassion but also of justice" (Records, Vol. II, <span style="">Testimonial of former Supreme </span>Court <span style="">Justice <span class="SpellE">Querube</span> <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Cognizant, therefore,
"that the power to discipline, especially if amounting to disbarment,
should be exercised on the preservative and not on the vindictive </span>principle,"
(In re Juan T. <span class="SpellE">Publico</span>, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">), </span>we
heed respondent's plea for reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His expiation subsequent to his disbarment; his realization of his <span style="">mistake and the gravity of his offense;</span>
t<span style="">he testimonials from exemplary members
of the Bar as to his fitness to </span>resume the practice of law; and his solemn
pledge to the Court that <span style="">if </span>his
disbarment is lifted, he will always closely and faithfully abide by the
ideals, canons and ethics of the <span style="">legal
