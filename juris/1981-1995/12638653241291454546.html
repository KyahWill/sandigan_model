				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In petitione<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">r</span>’s
own words:  “This case started as a
simple case of collection for a sum of money but took a bizarre turn in its
procedural aspect.” Well<b> </b>said indeed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 9, 1979, petitioner Alfonso Africa<b> </b>entered<b> </b>into<b>
</b>a “Grower’s Agreement” with private respondent San Miguel Corporation
(SMC).  Under said<b> </b>agreement, SMC
obligated itself to deliver to petitioner day-old broiler chicks while
petitioner bound himself, for a consideration, to raise<b> </b>and<b> </b>care<b>
</b>for<b> </b>the chicks for a period of eight (8) weeks after which the birds
would be hauled back by SMC for processing at its plant in Ca­buyao, Laguna.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That contract became the center of controversy between the
parties.  On February 20, 1984, SMC
filed an action for a sum of money against petitioner, alleging that upon the
maturity dates stipulated in the contract when the broilers should have been
delivered back to SMC, petitioner instead diverted the flock and sold the same
to third persons<b>, </b>to the prejudice of SMC which was deprived of
P317,000.00 as of July 31, 1980, inclusive of unrealized profits plus legal
interest counted from May 26, 1980.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner did not deny having sold <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>grown chicks <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>third
parties.  However, he claimed that it
was SMC which reneged on the terms of the contract by failing to haul the
chicks on the specified maturity dates, thus compelling him to seek other
buyers to avert great financial losses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for pre-trial conference on June 18, 1984 at
8:30 a.m.  Counsel for petitioner
arrived late.  Upon motion of counsel
for SMC, petitioner was declared as in default and SMC was allowed to present
its evidence <u>ex</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">parte</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>in support of the corporation’s
allegations.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On the same day, June 18, 1984, petitioner’s counsel promptly moved for<i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>reconsideration of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>the
order of default, and requested the clerk of court to<b> </b>set his motion for
hearing on June 22, 1984.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his motion to lift the default order, counsel for petitioner
recounted the following events to explain his late arrival at the pre-trial:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the instant case is<b> </b>set<b> </b>for
pre-trial conference, today, June 18, 1984, at 8:30 a.m.;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the undersigned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x x</span> arrived at the sala of this
Honorable Court at exactly 8:45 a.m., and was informed that the case was called
at 8:35 a.m., and that an<b> </b>Order was issued in Open Court declaring
herein Defendant as in <u>Default,</u> authorizing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>Plaintiff to present its evidence, ex-parte.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the <u>failure</u> of the undersigned
<u>to</u> <u>appear</u> <u>at</u> <u>exactly</u> 8:30 a.m., was due to
excusable negli­gence and/or accident, amounting to fortuitous event in that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From experience, it takes this
Representation forty (40) minutes to reach the sala of this Hon­orable Court,
coming from his residence at 1398-G Mayha­ligue St., Tondo, Manila;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That undersigned gave himself an allowance
of One (1) hour to enable him to reach the sala of this Honorable Court and
left his residence at exactly 7:10 a.m., thus expecting to be in<b> </b>Court
at 8:10 a.m., (at the latest) thus having enough time to locate and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">be </span>in Court room, on time for the
hearing of this case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That undersigned encountered <u>an</u> <u>unusually</u>
<u>inundate</u> <u>streets</u> on his way to this Court aggravated by the <u>unexpected</u>
<u>detour</u> from his usual route to this Court thus compounding his
predicament;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“d)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus- the undersigned arrived at exactly
8:45 a.m., and while the other cases in the calendar of the Court are still
being read, undersigned invited the attention of the Clerk of Court regarding
his presence, he was informed that the case was called at 8:35 a.m., and
accordingly, Defendant was declared as in default;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“
4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That as can be seen from all the
foregoing, the Defendant’s failure to be at the sala of this Hon­orable Court
was due to excusable negligence and/or accident, amounting to fortuitous event;

<p class="BODY">Two days later, or on June 20, 1984, respondent Judge Mendoza
issued the questioned decision, the dispositive part of which states:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff (SMC)
and against defendant (Africa) order­ing the latter:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. To pay plaintiff
the sum of P317,000.00 plus 12% interest from June 13, 1980, the date of the
letter of demand to defendant, until the same is fully paid;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. To pay plaintiff
the sum of P32,000.00 for liquidated damages in accordance with the Grower’s
Contract (Exhibit ‘A-7’);</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. To pay P5,000.00
as and by way of attorney’s fees; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. To pay the
costs.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was five days after the judgment of default was rendered when
respondent Judge Mendoza acted on the June 18, 1984 motion by counsel for
petitioner to set aside the order of default.  In his order dated June 25, 1984, respondent judge denied the afore<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">said motion.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then appealed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to
</span>the then Intermediate Appellate Court raising as errors<b> </b>the order
of default and the monetary award granted in favor of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">SMC.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court did not rule on the question regarding the
order of default.  It simply affirmed
with modifications the decision of the trial court, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, the dispositive portion of the
decision appealed from is modified to read as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff and
against defendant, ordering the latter:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘1. To pay plaintiff
the sum of P271,260.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">plus </span>12%
interest from June 13, 1980, the date of the letter of demand to the defendant,
until the same is fully paid;</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘2. To pay
P5,000.00 as and by way of attorney’s fees; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘3. To pay the
costs.’”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition which seeks to annul and set aside the
default judgment rendered by the trial court and the decision of the Appellate
Court sustaining the same with modifications, on the ground that they were both
rendered with grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule for petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has repeatedly warned against the injudicious and
often impetuous issuance of default orders.  In the case of Continental Leaf Tobacco (Phil.) Inc. vs. Intermediate
Appellate Court,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court explained why they should be discouraged:</p>

<blockquote>“Since a judgment of default presupposes proceed­ings where the
defendant is absent and cannot possibly present any evidence in his behalf, a
court should use it with thoughtful hesitation only as a last expedient to
induce the defendant to join issue upon the allega­tion tendered by the
plaintiff.  As early as 1913, the
Supreme Court made this clear in <u style="text-underline:words">C</u><u style="text-underline:words"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">o</span>ombs</u>
<u style="text-underline:words">vs</u>. <u style="text-underline:words">Santos</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
because such a judgment cannot pretend to be based on the merits of the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The records must be free from even the slightest suspicion that
the trial court seized upon an opportunity either to free itself from the usual
burdens of presiding over a fullblown court battle or worse, to give undue
advantage or favors to one of the litigants.  As pointed out in <u>Heirs</u> <u>of</u> <u>Fuentes</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Macandog</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
default is not a mechanical gadget for the acceleration of the judicial
litigation.  An intent to terminate a
case promptly is no excuse to cut corners and avoid the rules established to
safeguard due process rights of litigants.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, petitioner was declared as in default on
June 18, 1984 for his lawyer’s ten-minute delay at the pre­-trial.  That very day, the adverse party SMC was
allowed to present its evidence <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ex</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> <u>parte</u> </span>even as counsel for petitioner
was hurriedly preparing his motion to lift the order of default which motion he
actually filed on June 18, 1984.  After
two days, a decision was rendered in favor of SMC and yet it was only five days
later that respondent trial judge denied petitioner’s motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite obvious that petitioner was denied his basic right to
be heard, even after his counsel had promptly explained the reason for his
tardiness at the pre-trial.  As in the
cited Continental case, which, interestingly enough, involved the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> very same respondent judge, it would seem
that the proverbial wheels of justice literally “oversped”.  For an innocuous delay of ten minutes,
petitioner was ultimately denied </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">due
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">process of law which could have,
had respondent judge been in a less hurry to clear his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">docket, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">enabled him to present his defenses against SMC’s claim that he had
breached their agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">While it is desirable
that the Rules of Court be faithfully observed, courts should not be obsessively
strict over the occasional lapses of litigants.  Given a good reason, the trial court should set aside its order
of default, constantly bearing in mind that it is the exception and not the
rule of the day.  A default order must
be resorted to only in clear cases of obstinate refusal or inordinate neglect
to comply with the orders of the court</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>
