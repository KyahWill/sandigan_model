				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What is put into test in this petition is the legal effect of a final
judgment arising from an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case in the
execution of a parallel case for <span style="">collection
that has become final and </span>executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span style="">filed
an action </span>for collection of a sum of money in the Metropolitan Trial
Court (MTC) of Manila against petitioner and several others for reimbursement
of payment of electrical consumption of the apartment that private respondent, <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, made in behalf <span style="">of </span>petitioner, in the amount <span style="">of P2,352.00 </span>from May 21, <span style="">1978
</span>to August <span style="">20, </span>1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course a judgment was rendered in
favor of <span style="">private </span><span style="">respondent and when the judgment became final
and executory private respondent filed a motion for the issuance of a writ of
execution thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing, petitioner filed an opposition to the motion
alleging that he did not receive any copy of the decision of the court dated <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court in open session ordered that
he be immediately served the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the judgment nevertheless became final, the execution of the
same was undertaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time,
petitioner filed a manifestation in court on <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1989</st1:date> alleging that this Court in a resolution
in G.R. No. 82596 dated <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1989</st1:date>
arising from an action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> found that
petitioner is not a lessee of private respondent but one Victoria <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> thereby affirming a decision of the Court of
Appeals to this effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner alleges that since he is not a lessee of private respondent the
judgment for a sum of money cannot be enforced against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The opposition of petitioner was denied in an order of the lower
court dated September 22, 1989 wherein it was observed that the collection case
is separate and distinct from the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case as
they are based on different <span style="">causes of
action, and thus the latter cannot be an obstacle in the execution of the final
and executory judgment of the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for reconsideration of said order which was filed by the petitioner was
denied by the inferior court </span>on <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
petition wherein the petitioner raises the following alleged errors of the
lower court:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">“I</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT JUDGE ERRED IN STATING THAT HIS
DECISION DATED <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="2">FEBRUARY 28, 1989</st1:date>
(Annex “L”) HAD ALREADY BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT JUDGE FAILED TO CONSIDER THAT A
DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT FORMS PART OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE <st1:country-region><st1:place>PHILIPPINES</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT JUDGE EXCEEDED HIS AUTHORITY
WHEN HE ORDERED PETITIONER TO PAY ELECTRIC CONSUMPTION USED IN THE APARTMENT OF
PRIVATE RESPONDENT CONSIDERING THAT PETITIONER <span style="">IS </span>NOT A LESSEE/TENANT IN THE SAID APARTMENT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IV<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><st1:street><st1:address>RESPONDENT COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF THE PETITIONER AND ISSUE OF THE CASE.”<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No doubt the judgment <span style="">in </span>the
collection ca<span style="">s</span>e has become final
and executory for when petitioner claimed in open court he had not been served
a copy thereof, he was ordered furnished a copy<span style=""> </span>by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His denial
now that he was not given a copy of the decision in court cannot be given any
credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cause of action in the collection case is different and
distinct from that of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the enforcement of the collection case
cannot be prevented by the independent <span style="">judgment
</span>of this Court <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the claim of petitioner that the findings of this Court
in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case to the effect that he was not a
lessee of the premises of the private respondent but one Victoria <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> so that he should not be made to pay for the
electrical consumption of the apartment concerned is a sham allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears from the comment of private respondent
that Victoria <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>, who is a co-lessee of the
petitioner of the apartment, is petitioner’s common-law-<span style="">wife.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Petitioner has not denied this
assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the situation
petitioner is just as liable as <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> to
reimburse the electrical consumption </span>of <span style="">the apartment they occupied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that the lessee of the apartment should
pay for the electrical consumption of the apartment they occupy unless there is
a stipulation to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where as
in this case, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> advanced the payment of
electrical consumption, the duty of the petitioner to reimburse the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is inescapable.</p>

<p class="BODY">To say the least, this petition is frivolous and should not have
reached this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED with treble costs
against petitioner.</p>
