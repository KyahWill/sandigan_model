<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Branch 123 finding accused 
RODOLFO DE LA CRUZ guilty of the crime of murder and sentencing him to 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> the sum of 
P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant with two other persons identified only 
<span>as </span><span>"<span class="SpellE">Flory</span>" </span>and "<span class="SpellE">Jojo</span>" were charged in two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) for Murder and (2) for 
Frustrated Murder respectively and allegedly committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"That on or about the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of September, 1979 in 
<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Metro Manila and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused conspiring 
together and mutually helping one another, with deliberate intent to kill, with 
treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously attack, assault and stab one <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">y 
</span>Castro hitting the latter on the vital parts of his body, thereby 
inflicting upon him serious physical injuries which injuries caused his 
instantaneous death."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That on or about the 23rd day of September, 1979 in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of 
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused conspiring together and mutually 
helping one another, with deliberate intent to kill, with treachery and evident 
premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, 
assault and stab one <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> de Castro y <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> hitting the latter on the vital parts of his body, 
thereby inflicting upon him serious physical injuries, thus performing all the 
acts of execution which would have produced the crime of murder as a 
consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent 
of the will of the herein accused, that is due to the timely, able and efficient 
medical attendance rendered to the victim at the V. Luna Memorial Hospital, 
which prevented his death."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence which attributed the killing of <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> to herein 
appellant and established the finding of his guilt <span>was </span>summarized 
by the lower court as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> [T]hat on <st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1979">September 23, 1979</st1:date>, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> and his cousin, 
complainant <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> de Castro were at the Blue 
Heaven Restaurant from <st1:time hour="2" minute="30">2:30 A.M.</st1:time> up to 
about <st1:time hour="4" minute="30">4:30 A.M.</st1:time> drinking beer.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Before they left the restaurant, there took place some altercation and 
throwing of bottles among the employees of the restaurant because Fe Ramos <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, a waitress, asked the management for her commission 
for the drinks she ordered and when they refused, she wanted to leave.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The management refused to allow her to leave since it was still early for 
her to go home.<span>&nbsp; </span>So she started throwing bottles.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> de Castro were not involved in the 
trouble.<span>&nbsp; </span>They only tried to pacify the waitresses who were 
throwing bottles at each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>The three accused who were all 
waiters in the restaurant, likewise, were not involved in the quarrel that took 
place.<span>&nbsp; </span>They also tried to pacify the quarrelling waitresses (TSN, 
p. 6 May 22, 1980).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"As a result of this incident Fe Ramos <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> left with her two customers <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> and de Castro.<span>&nbsp; </span>After leaving the place 
Fe Ramos <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> and her two companions boarded a 
passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> at <span class="SpellE">Sangandaan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, not far from the Blue Heaven 
Restaurant.<span>&nbsp; </span>The three accused ran after them.<span>&nbsp; </span>While 
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was stopped because of the red signal 
light, the three accused blocked the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, pulled 
out the three who happened to be the only passengers at the time, and when 
outside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> 
was stabbed and after being mauled, de Castro was also stabbed.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The two victims were brought to the <span class="SpellE">Ospital</span> 
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> where <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> died on the same 
day.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> de Castro, being a 
soldier, was transferred to the V. Luna Hospital after staying two hours at the 
<span class="SpellE">Ospital</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the V. Luna Hospital, de Castro 
was operated on in connection with his stab wounds.<span>&nbsp; </span>He stayed in 
said hospital for approximately six months.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Dominguez, the army doctor who operated on him 
testified that the injury inflicted on de Castro could have caused his death if 
they had not operated on him."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The lower court acquitted the appellant of the crime of frustrated 
murder but convicted him on the charge of murder.<span>&nbsp; </span>Judgment was 
rendered against de la Cruz only, as John Doe <em>alias</em> <span class="SpellE">Flory</span> and Peter Doe <em>alias</em> <span class="SpellE">Jojo</span> remained at large.</p>
<p class="BODY">The appellant raised the following assignment of errors in this 
appeal:</p>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THAT THE COURT-<em>A-QUO </em>ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE TESTIMONIES 
OF PROSECUTION WITNESSES FE RAMOS AND SIMPLICIO DE CASTRO ARE SUFFICIENT TO 
ATTRIBUTE THE KILLING OF LUISITO APOSTOL TO HEREIN 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT.</blockquote>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">THAT THE COURT-<em>A-QUO</em> ERRED IN HOLDING 
THAT A JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION DESPITE THE ABSOLUTE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO 
SUPPORT THE SAME (SIC).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>(p. 1, Appellant's 
Brief)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The issue raised in the two assigned errors is whether or not the 
trial court erred in determining the value and credibility of the evidence 
presented.</p>
<p class="BODY">We have carefully studied the records of this case and we find no 
reason to deviate from the well-settled rule that the findings of fact of the 
trial court and its conclusions regarding the credibility of witnesses are 
generally accorded high respect by the appellate court in view of its 
opportunity to examine the demeanor of the witnesses as they testify (<em>People 
v. Adones</em>, G.R. No. 63453, September 24, 1986; <em>People v. Ramilo</em>, 
G.R. No. 52230, December 15, 1986; People v. <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, 
G.R. No. 70255, January 29, 1987).</p>
<p class="BODY">Appellant De la Cruz contends that the testimony of the 
prosecution witness, Fe Ramos did in fact support his claim of innocence.</p>
<blockquote>Ramos testified:</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Luisito</span>? </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span>&nbsp;</span>A.<span>&nbsp;</span></td>

sir.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, p. 8, May 22, 
1980)"</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">De la Cruz then alleges that since the lower court ruled out 
conspiracy, he could not be held liable for murder on the basis of the above 
testimony.</p>
<p class="BODY">Upon a perusal of her entire testimony, it can be gleaned that 
Ramos did not see the appellant actually stab the victim <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, such did not automatically 
support the appellant's claim of innocence as she did in fact corroborate the 
other prosecution witness' testimony that the appellant was one of those who 
ganged up on the victim (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 22, 1980, p. 4).</p>
<p class="BODY">The other prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> 
de Castro was the one who positively identified the appellant.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is a well established <span class="GramE">rule</span> that the 
testimony of a single witness, if positive and credible, is sufficient to 
support a conviction even in a charge for murder. (<em>People v. Romero</em>, 
119 SCRA 234).</p>
<p class="BODY">The appellant questions the credibility of de Castro by alleging 
grave material inconsistencies and contradictions in his testimony.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He further alleges contradictions in de Castro's testimony <span class="SpellE"><em>vis-a-vis</em></span> the other prosecution witnesses' 
testimonies.</p>
<p class="BODY">This is, however, not the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>As mentioned 
earlier, de Castro's testimony was corroborated by Ramos rather than 
contradicted.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both testified to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Jojo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Flory</span> and the appellant de 
la Cruz ganged up on the victim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although Ramos testified that she 
did not see who actually stabbed <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> such 
statement does not in any way contradict de Castro's testimony that he saw the 
appellant stab <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The appellant then alleges that de Castro could not have given an 
accurate account of what happened, as at the time of the incident, the latter 
himself had already sustained nearly fatal wounds.</p>
<p class="BODY">This is based on the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Dominguez, the physician who attended to witness De 
Castro when he was brought to the hospital.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dominguez 
testified:</p>
<table align="center" border="0" width="80%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="10%">"Q.<span>&nbsp; </span></td>
<td width="90%">
<div align="justify">If <span class="GramE">this surgical procedures</span> were not 
taken by the hospital will this injury cause the death of the 
patient?</div></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span>&nbsp;</span>A.<span>&nbsp;</span></td>
<td>
<div align="justify">Yes, sir. <span class="GramE">Possible.</span><span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, p. 4 September 22, 
1982).</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>De Castro was still 
in a condition to discern the things happening around him.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Although he already sustained two stab wounds, he did not lose his senses 
<span class="GramE">nor</span> his posture; in fact he even had the sense to run 
away when Ramos shouted for him to run (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, November 
19, 1980, p. 21).</p>
<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Dr. Dominguez testified that when de Castro was 
brought to him, his physical condition was that "he was conscious, coherent, in 
other words depressed to normal." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, September 22, 1982, p. 3).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">De la Cruz next questions the fact that de Castro did not mention 
his name when the latter was asked by Detective <span class="SpellE">Lascano</span> as to who their assailants were, although he knew 
their names.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, 
November 19, 1980, p. 29).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that:</p>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Lascano</span> investigated <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> on 
the very date of the incident, <st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1979">September 23, 1979</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> was still in very serious condition that he could 
only affix his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> instead of his signature (p. 
4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., July 18, 1980).<span>&nbsp; </span>Obviously <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> was suffering from the stab wounds when he was 
investigated that it could have blurred his memory.<span>&nbsp; </span>But after he 
was cured, he positively identified him in open court.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no 
motive advanced why <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> would concoct such a 
fabrication.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>A </span>man not accustomed to open trial could 
not have falsified and still appear credible to the trial court.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span>The trial court </span>gave him credence because he was telling the 
truth."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, alibi does not deserve much credit as it was 
established only by the accused <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(See <em>People v. Abigan</em>, G.R. No. 69674, 
September <span>15, 1986).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by the court:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court is not inclined to believe this uncorroborated claim that 
he stayed behind at the restaurant when the victims were chased outside by the 
assailants.<span>&nbsp; </span>From testimonies of the <span>witnesses, </span>there 
were a number of employees of the restaurant, waitresses, waiters or helpers, 
who were in the restaurant at the time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anyone of these could have 
been presented to testify and corroborate the testimony of defendant Rodolfo de 
la Cruz that he stayed behind.<span>&nbsp; </span>Absence of such corroboration, in 
the light of the categorical statement of one of the victims, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span>de Castro </span>that he saw accused Rodolfo 
de la Cruz stab <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> because there was a lighted post at the place of the 
incident, (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, p. 8, November 19, 1980) is fatal to 
the defense."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">It is <span>a </span>well-established rule that alibi cannot
