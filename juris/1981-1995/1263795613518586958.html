				<H3>E.B. MARCHA TRANSPORT CO., INC. AND EPIFANIO B. MARCHA, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

<p class="BODY">There is no need to resolve all the issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> in this petition for review by <i>certiorari</i> of 
the decision of the respondent court.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only question we have to 
decide is whether or not the Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> was 
the proper party to sue the petitioner for recovery of possession of the 
property occupied by them and for back rentals 
thereon.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The said property is indisputably public land which petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Marcha</span> entered 
in 1949 without any previous authorization from the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span>It is located in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span>, 
within the customs zone.<span>&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1977" day="11" month="5"><span>May 11, 1977</span></st1:date><span>, the Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
sued for its recovery and rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It 
was sustained by the Court of First Instance of Manila in a decision rendered on 
</span><st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="7"><span>July 31, 
1980</span></st1:date><span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which 
was affirmed <em>in toto</em> by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> That decision is now before 
us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The consistent stance of the petitioners, both in the trial court 
and in the Intermediate Appellate Court, was that the Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> had 
no capacity to file the complaint in the court <em>a quo</em> because the real 
owner of the disputed property at that time was no longer the national 
government but the Philippine Ports Authority.<span>&nbsp; </span>The basis of this 
argument is P.D. No. 857 which, on <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1975</st1:date>, transferred <em>inter alia</em> all 
port areas (including the land in question) from the Bureau of Customs to the 
Philippine Ports Authority, which has a separate juridical personality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The respondent court held that the petitioners were <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from raising this argument because of their act in 
applying for the lease of the land with the Bureau of Customs and not the 
Philippine Ports Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> By doing 
so, they have come under the provisions of Article 1431 of the Civil Code 
declaring as follows:<o:p></o:p></p>
<blockquote>"Art. 1431<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>Through</span> <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> an admission or representation is rendered 
conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as 
against the person relying thereon."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Amplifying this point, the Solicitor General stresses that the 
petitioners' lease application was filed with the Bureau of Customs and 
disapproved on <st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="7">July 22, 
1974</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their motion for reconsideration was denied, and 
on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1974</st1:date>, they 
filed an appeal with the Secretary of Finance, who dismissed it on <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1975</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the 
while, the Philippine Ports Authority had already been operating, having come 
into existence on <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="7">July 11, 
1974</st1:date>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> By ignoring its 
authority over the land in dispute, the petitioners are now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from challenging the personality of the respondent 
Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 
this action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We agree, although this is not really the crucial 
issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">More importantly, as we see it, dismissing the complaint on the 
ground that the Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
is not the proper party would result in needless delay in the settlement of this 
matter and also in derogation of the policy against multiplicity of 
suits.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such a decision would require the Philippine Ports 
Authority to <span class="SpellE">refile</span> the very same complaint already 
proved by the Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
and bring back the parties as it were to square one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It can be said that in suing for the recovery of the rentals, the 
Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
acted as principal of the Philippine Ports Authority, directly exercising the 
commission it had earlier conferred on the latter as its agent.<span>&nbsp; </span>We 
may presume that, by doing so, the Republic of the Philippines did not intend to 
retain the said rentals for its own use, considering that by its voluntary act 
it had transferred the land in question to the Philippine Ports Authority 
effective July 11, 1974.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>The Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
had simply sought to assist, not supplant, the Philippine Ports Authority, whose 
title to the disputed property it continues to recognize.<span>&nbsp; </span>We may 
expect then that the said rentals, once collected by the Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, 
shall be turned over by it to the Philippine Ports Authority conformably to the 
purposes of P.D. No. 857.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Although it is not exactly applicable, we cite the following 
enlightening lesson from <st1:street><st1:address>Justice 
Street</st1:address></st1:street> in the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Orio</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Hermanos</em></span><em> v. Gutierrez Hermanos</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> decided almost sixty years ago:</p>
<blockquote>"Upon stripping the case of its embellishments, the plaintiff's 
contention in the end comes to <span class="GramE">this, that,</span> under 
section 114 of our Code of Civil Procedure, litigation should be conducted in 
the name of the real party in interest.<span>&nbsp; </span>This means of course that 
where an assignable right has been transferred before action brought, the 
proceeding ought to be instituted in the name of the assignee; and where an 
assignment is effected <span class="SpellE"><em>pendente</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>lite</em></span>, it is proper to have the assignee substituted 
for the original plaintiff.<span>&nbsp; </span>If such substitution should not be 
effected and the transfer of the right of action should not be brought to the 
attention of the court, the original plaintiff, if successful in the litigation, 
would hold the fruits of the action as a sort of trustee for the use and benefit 
of his assignee.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it would be surprising doctrine to hold that 
where the assignee has assented to the continued prosecution of the action by 
the original plaintiff, the defendant can nullify the judgment, after litigation 
has been concluded, on the ground that the interest in litigation had been 
transferred.<span>&nbsp; </span>When this feat is attempted, the defendant can be 
properly met by the proposition that if any irregularity was committed in the 
prosecution of the case, it was, as to him, error without injury.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Certainly it cannot be contended that the transfer of a right of action 
<span class="SpellE"><em>pendente</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>lite</em></span> affects the jurisdiction of the 
court."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">We affirm the findings of the court <em>a quo</em> and the 
Intermediate Appellate Court that as a mere squatter in the disputed land, the 
petitioners had not acquired <span>a </span>vested right to lease or buy the 
property under the laws cited by them.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court 
dated <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1984</st1:date>, is 
hereby affirmed<em> in toto</em>.</p>
