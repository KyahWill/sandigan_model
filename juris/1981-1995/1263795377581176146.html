<p class="BODY">It is plain from the very wordings of the Order that it has exclusive
application to administrative, not criminal, complaints.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Order itself shows why.</p>

<p class="BODY">The very title speaks of "COMMISSION OF
IRREGULARITIES." There is no mention, not even by implication, of criminal
"offenses," that is to say, "crimes." While "crimes"
amount to "irregularities," the Executive Order could have very well
referred to the more specific term had it intended to make itself applicable <span class="GramE">thereto.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first perambulatory clause states the necessity for informing
the public "of the procedure provided by law and regulations by which
complaints against public officials and employees should be presented and
prosecuted."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
To our mind, the "procedure provided by law and regulations" referred
to pertains to existing procedural rules with respect to the presentation of
administrative charges against erring government officials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And in fact, the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
paragraphs are but restatements thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That presidential appointees are subject to the disciplinary
jurisdiction of the President, for instance, is a reecho of the long-standing
doctrine that the President exercises the power of control over his appointees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Paragraph 3, on the other hand, regarding subordinate officials, is a mere
reiteration of Section 33 of Republic Act No. 2260, the Civil Service Act (of
1959) then in force, placing jurisdiction upon "the proper Head of
Department, the chief of a bureau or office"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
to investigate and decide on matters involving disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 4, which refers to complaints filed against elective
local officials, reiterates, on the other hand, the Decentralization Act of
1967, providing that "charges against any elective provincial and city
officials shall be preferred before the President of the Philippines; against
any elective municipal official before the provincial governor or the secretary
of the provincial board concerned; and against any elective barrio official
before the municipal or secretary concerned."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 5, meanwhile, is a reproduction of the provisions of
the Police Act of 1966, vesting upon a "Board of Investigators"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the jurisdiction to try and decide complaints against members of the Philippine
police.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the Executive Order simply consolidates these existing
rules and streamlines the administrative apparatus in the matter of complaints
against public officials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
the fact is that there is no reference therein to judicial or pre-judicial
(like a preliminary investigation conducted by the fiscal) recourse, not because
it makes such a resort a secondary measure, but because it does not intend to
serve as a condition precedent to, much less supplant, such a court resort.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, there is mention therein of "court action[s] [<span class="GramE">being]</span> pursued forthwith by the interested parties,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
but that does not, so we hold, cover proceedings such as criminal actions,
which do not require a prior administrative course of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will indeed be noted that the term is
closely shadowed by the qualification, "after administrative remedies
shall have been exhausted,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
which suggests civil suits subject to previous administrative action.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is moreover significant that the Executive Order in question
makes specific reference to "erring officials or employees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> removed or otherwise
vindicated."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> If
it were intended to apply to criminal prosecutions, it would have employed such
technical terms as "accused," "convicted", or
"acquitted".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While this is not
necessarily a controlling parameter for all cases, it is here material in
construing the intent of the measure.</p>

<p class="BODY">What <span class="GramE">is</span> even more compelling is the
Constitutional implications if the petitioner's arguments were accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For Executive Order No. 264
was promulgated under the 1935 Constitution in which legislative power was
vested exclusively in Congress.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The regime of Presidential lawmaking was to usher in yet some seven
years later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If we were to consider the
Executive Order law, we would be forced to say that it is an amendment to
Republic Act No. 5180, the law on preliminary investigations then in effect, a
situation that would give rise to a Constitutional anomaly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot accordingly countenance such a
view.</p>

<p class="BODY">The challenge the petitioner presents against the personality of
the Anti-Graft League of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to bring suit is equally without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That the Anti-Graft League is not an "offended party" within
the meaning of Section 2, Rule 110, of the Rules of Court (now Section 3 of the
1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure), cannot abate the complaints in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">A complaint for purposes of preliminary investigation by the
fiscal need not be filed by the "offended party." The rule has been
that, unless the offense subject thereof is one that cannot be prosecuted <b>de
<span class="SpellE">oficio</span></b>, the same may be filed, for preliminary
investigation purposes, by any competent person.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The "complaint" referred to in the Rule 110 contemplates one filed in
court, not with the fiscal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="GramE">the that</span> case, the proceeding must be started by the
aggrieved party himself.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For as a general rule, a criminal action is commenced by
complaint or information, both of which are filed in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case of a complaint, it must be filed by
the offended party; with respect to <span class="GramE">an information</span>, it
is the fiscal who files it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But a
"complaint" filed with the fiscal prior to a judicial action may be
filed by any person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question is whether or not the temporary restraining
order we issued in G.R. No. 33628 embraced as well the complaint subject of
G.R. No. 34162.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the charges <span class="SpellE">levelled</span>
against the petitioner -- whether in G.R. No. 33628 or 34162 -- refer
invariably to violations of the Anti-Graft law or the Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That does not, however, make such charges
identical to one another.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaints involved in G.R. No. 34162 are, in general,
nepotism under Sections 3(c) and (j) of Republic Act No. 3019; exerting
influence upon the presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> to award a
certain parcel of land in his favor, over which the provincial government
itself lays claims, contrary to the provisions of Section 4(b) of Republic Act
No. 3019; and making untruthful statements in the certificates of appointment
of certain employees in his office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, the complaints subject matter of G.R. No. 33628 involve charges
of simulating bids for the supply of gravel and sand for certain public works
projects, in breach of Section 3 of the Anti-Graft statute; manipulating bids
with respect to the construction of the capitol building; testifying falsely in
connection with Cadastral Case No. <span class="GramE">N-17, LRC Cad.</span> Rec.
N-468, in which the petitioner alleged that he was the owner of a piece of
land, in violation of Articles 182, 183, and 318 of the Revised Penal Code; and
simulating bids for the supply of gravel and sand in connection with another
public works project.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the twin sets of complaints are characterized by
major differences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When, therefore, we
restrained further proceedings in I.S. Nos. 1-71, 2-71, and 4-71, subject of
G.R. No. 33628, we did not consequently stay the proceedings in CCC XVI-4-ZDS,
CCC XVI-6-ZDS, CCC XVI-8-ZDS, and I.S. Nos. 6-71 and 7-71, the same proceedings
we did restrain in G.R. No. 34162.</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the last issue:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>whether or not the complaints in question are tainted with a political color.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not our business to resolve complaints the disposition of
which belongs to another agency, in this case, the respondent Fiscal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But more than that, and as a general rule,
injunction does not lie to enjoin criminal prosecutions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule is subject to exceptions, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) for the orderly administration of justice; (2) to prevent the use of
the strong arm of the law in an oppressive and vindictive manner; (3) to avoid
multiplicity of actions; (4) to afford adequate protection to constitutional
rights; and (5) because the statute relied on is constitutionally infirm or
otherwise void.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
We cannot perceive any of the exceptions applicable here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner cries foul, in a manner of
speaking, with respect to the deluge of complaints commenced by the private
respondent below, but whether or not they were filed for harassment purposes is
a question we are not in a position to decide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The proper venue, we believe, for the petitioner's <span class="GramE">plaints
is</span> precisely in the preliminary investigations he wishes blocked here.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petitions are DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining orders are LIFTED
and SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against the petitioner.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED">It is so ORDERED.</p>
