<p class="BODY">a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Violation of Wage Order
No. 5, by crediting the P1.00 per day increase in the CBA as part of the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1985</st1:date>,
Labor Arbiter Ruben Alberto ruled in favor of Plastic Town Center Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions of the decision read
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">In</span> this particular case, the P1.00 increase was ahead of the
implementation of the CEA provision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>could
be said was advantageous to complainant members, chronologically stated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the above co<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

second P1.00 increase on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 1, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant sustains the view that a month salary pertains to
salary for 30 days, citing the provision of the Civil Code on the matter.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon the other hand, <span class="GramE">respondents understanding
of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> provision is</span> pragmatic or
practical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the workers are paid on
daily basis, it computed the salary received by the worker in a month as a
month salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case the salary
for 26 days is a month salary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We agree with the respondent's interpretation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As daily wage earner, there would be no
instance that the worker would work for 30 days a month since work does not
include Sundays or rest days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
mind of the daily worker in a month he could not expect a month salary
exceeding the equivalent of 26 days service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To award the daily wage earner pay for more than 26 days is pay for days
he does not work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But as regards the
monthly paid workers he expects his monthly salary to be fixed which <span class="GramE">is a month salary</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1987</st1:date>,
the respondent labor union appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1987</st1:date>,
the NLRC rendered the questioned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">decision

gratuity pay, as required by its CBA with the complainants." (p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration of said decision was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">denied </span>on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">December </span>7, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The applicable provisions of the CBA read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1 – The company agrees to grant permanent/regular
rank and file workers covered by this Agreement who have rendered at least one
year of continuous service, across the­ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">board

other labor legislation." (pp. 36-37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Wage Order No. 4 provided
for the integration of the mandatory emergency cost of living allowances
(ECOLA) under Presidential Decrees 1614, 1634, 1678 and 1713 into the basic pay
of all covered workers effective <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="5">May 1,
 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It further provided
that after the integration, the applicable statutory minimum daily wage rate
must be complied with, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>this
case is P32.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner incurred a deficiency of P1.00 in the wage rate
after integrating the ECOLA with the basic pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So the petitioner advanced to <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="5">May
 1, 1984</st1:date> or two months earlier the implementation of the one-peso
wage increase provided for in the CBA starting <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1984</st1:date> for the benefit of the workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues that it did not credit the P1.00 per day
across the board increase under the CBA as compliance with Wage Order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">No. </span>5 implemented on <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1984</st1:date> since it gave an
additional P3.00 per day to the basic salary pursuant to said order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It, however, credited the P1.00 a day
increase to the requirement under Wage Order No. 4 to which the private
respondents allegedly did not object.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> provision of the
CBA reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 2.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the intention of both the COMPANY and

is not covered by Section 1 above, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">COMPANY

salary."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner alleges that one month salary for daily paid
workers should be computed on the basis of twenty-six (26) days and not thirty
(30) days since daily wage workers do not work every day of the month includ­ing
Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject for interpretation in this petition for review is not
the Labor Code or its implementing rules and regulations but the provisions of
the collective bargaining agreement entered into by management and the labor
union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a contract, it constitutes the
law between the parties (<span class="SpellE">Fegurin</span> v. National Labor
Relations Commis­sion, 120 SCRA 910 [1983]) and in interpreting <span class="GramE">contracts,</span> the rules on contract must govern.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contracts which are not ambiguous are to be inter­preted
according to their literal meaning and should not be interpreted beyond their
obvious intendment (Herrera v. <span class="SpellE">Petrophil</span> Corp., 146
SCRA 385 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In </span>the case at
bar, the petitioner alleges that on <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="5">May
 1, 1984</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it granted a P1.00
increase pursuant to Wage Order No. 4 which in consonance with Section 3 of the
CBA was to be credited to the </span><st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 1, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> increase under the CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It </span>was, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">therefore, a July increase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section
3 of the CBA, however, clearly states that CBA granted increases shall be
credited against </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">future</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allowances
or wage orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the CBA increase
to be effected on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 1, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> can not be retroactively applied to mean com­pliance
with Wage Order No. 4 which took effect on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">May 1, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
words of the contract are plain and readily understandable so we find no need
for any further cons­truction or interpretation (<span class="SpellE">Dihiansan</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 153 SCRA 712 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, we agree with the NLRC as it held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is our finding that the respondent is bound by the CBA to
grant an increase on <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="7">July <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this case, between <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1983</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1984</st1:date>,
there were actually two increases mandated by Wage Order No. 4 on <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1984</st1:date> and by Wage Order-NO. 5 on
<st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the respondent had complied
with Wage Order No. 4 and Wage Order No. 5 does not relieve it of its
obligation to grant the P1.00 increase under the CBA." (pp. 37-38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With regards to the second issue, the petitioner maintains that
under the principle of "fair days wage for fair day's labor",
gratuity pay should be computed on the basis of 26 days for one month salary
considering that the employees are daily paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NLRC </span>in granting gratuity pay
equivalent to one month or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">30 days
salary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We quote with favor the NLRC decision which states:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> To say <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>awarding
the daily wage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">earner salary for more
than 26 days is paying him for days he does not work misses the point
entirely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue here is not <span class="GramE">pay</span> merit for days worked but </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">payment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of gratuity pay
equivalent to one month or 30 days salary." (p. 29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Looking into the definition of gratuity, we find the following in
<st1:city><st1:place>Moreno</st1:place></st1:city>'s <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Salary or compensation.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The very term 'gratuity' differs from the

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, gratuity pay is therefore, not intended to
pay a worker for actual services rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a money benefit given to the workers whose purpose is "to
reward employees or laborers, who have rendered satisfactory and efficient
service to the company." (Sec. 2, CBA) While it may be enforced once it
forms part of a contractual undertaking, the grant of such benefit is not
mandatory so as to be considered a part of labor standard law unlike the
salary, cost of living allowances, holiday pay, leave benefits, etc., which are
covered by the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere has
it ever been stated that gratuity pay should be based on the actual number of
days worked over <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the period of years
forming its basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">see no point in counting the number of days
worked over a ten-year period to determine the meaning of "two and
one-half months' gratuity." Moreover any doubts or ambiguity in the con­tract
between management and the union members should be resolved in the light of
Article 1702 of the Civil Code that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In case of doubt, all labor legislation and all labor
contracts shall be construed in favor of the safety and decent living for the
laborer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is also in consonance with the principle enunciated in the
Labor Code that all doubts should be resolved in favor of the worker.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Code provides that when months are not designated by
name, a month is understood to be thirty (30) days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provision applies under the circumstances
of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the public respondent did not act with
grave abuse of discretion when it rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
