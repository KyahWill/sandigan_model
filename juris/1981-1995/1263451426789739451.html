				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 22, 1981, the Court issued the following resolution: <blockquote> <p> "Acting on the letter of Judge Alicia V. Sempio-Diy, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Caloocan City, dated August 26, 1981, informing this Court that Mrs. Amelia G. Suarez, Cashier of the said court has not been filing her monthly report as cashier of the above-mentioned court and that the last report filed by her was for the month of December, 1980, with request that the Court's Financial Officer conduct an official audit on said cashier's account and records as soon as possible, as well as the report dated September 15, 1981 of Mr. Dimas H. Guevarra of the Accounting Division of this Court who was sent to examine the cash accountability of said Mrs. Suarez, the comment/explanation of Mrs. Suarez, and the report of Court Administrator Lorenzo Relova, recommending that she be (a) found guilty of serious misconduct prejudicial to public service and be separated from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, her unjustified actions being suffi­cient to warrant her separation from the service, and (b) ordered to pay the whole amount (P7,566.16) without need of conducting any formal investigation, considering that the records of the case sufficiently provide a basis for determination of her administrative liability, the Court Resolved to DIRECT the Clerk of Court to furnish the respondent copies of the aforesaid reports of Court Administrator Relova and Mr. Guevarra, for COMMENT within seventy-two (72) hours from notice, why said reports should not be approved and her dismissal ordered by the Court." </p> </blockquote> <p> On November 3, 1981, the Court Administrator submitted the following report and recommendation: </p><blockquote> <p> "ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER FOR AGENDA </p> <p> "Subject Matter: ADM. MATTER No. P-2599. - Hon. Alicia V. Sempio-Diy, JDRC, Caloocan City vs. Amelia Garcia Suarez, Cashier, same court, for serious misconduct prejudicial to the public interest. </p> <p> "Reason for Subject-Request: Submitted to this Court on Oct. 30, 1981 is the attached respondent's letter of even date, in compliance with the Resolution of the Court dated Oct. 22, 1981. </p> <p> "Other Relevant Information: In the Memorandum of Oct. 12, 1981 the undersigned has recommended 'that respondent Amelia G. Suarez be found guilty of serious misconduct prejudicial to the public interest and that she be separated from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and pay, and payment of the whole amount.' </p> <p> "The Court En Banc, in its Resolution of October 22, 1981, resolved 'to DIRECT the Clerk of Court to furnish the respondent copies of the aforesaid reports of Court Administrator Relova and Mr. Guevarra, for COMMENT within seventy-two (72) hours from notice, why said reports should not be approved and her dismissal ordered by the Court.' </p> <p> "RECOMMENDATION: SUBMITTED to the Honorable Court is the aforementioned letter dated Oct. 30, 1981 of respondent Amelia G. Suarez, in compliance with the Resolution dated Oct. 22, 1981 of this Court. </p> <p> (Sgd.)

I have suffered for it. I have repented. </p> <p> Very truly yours, </p> <p> (Sgd.) Amelia G. Suarez" </p> </blockquote> <p> After mature deliberation, the Court resolved to DENY the request of respondent Suarez and to approve the recommendation of the Court Administrator of October 12, 1981 that "respondent Amelia G. Suarez be found guilty of serious misconduct prejudicial to the public interest and that she be separated from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and pay, and payment of the whole amount." </p><p> This resolution is immediately executory. </p><p> <i>Fernando, C.J., Teehankee, Makasiar, Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Fernandez, Guerrero, De Castro, Melencio-Herrera, Ericta, Plana,</i> and <i>Escolin, JJ.,</i> concur. <i>Abad Santos, J.,</i> on official leave. </p></div>
