four-year program of gradual decontrol' and empowering the Monetary Board to
promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out the law's provisions.</blockquote>

defendant Central Bank approved Resolution No. 632 adopting a 'program of
Gradual Decontrol', and further approved, on April 25, 1960, CB Circular No.
105 which established a decontrol rate of P3.20 to $1.00 but specifically

defendant Central Bank issued CB Circular No. 121 which eliminated 'existing
