				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On 3 November 1980, at about three o'clock in the afternoon, Roberto
Laino and Gregorio Santillan, both trustee inmates<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> of
San Ramon Penal Farm, were exchanging fist blows along the national highway in
Labuan, Zamboanga City.  Accused Sgt.
Jerry Balanon, an enlisted man of the Philippine Army assigned at the Southern
Command Headquarters (SOUTHCOM), Camp Navarro, Calarian, Zamboanga City,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was standing nearby.  As the fight
progressed, Sgt. Balanon left for a nearby store.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ms. Maria Luningning Sinsuan and Ms. Elsa de la Cruz, both
teachers in the Labuan Barangay High School were seated on a bench in the house
of Alim Usman some three feet away from the road waiting for a bus to take them
to Zamboanga City.  They were twenty to
twenty-five meters away from the protagonists.  One of them shouted for help so Ms. Sinsuan went near to pacify them
saying, <i><span style="">"Tama na yan</span></i><span style="">.<i>"</i> </span>One of them retorted, <span style="">"<i>Alam mo </i>Ma'am ...," </span>but
was cut short when Balanon went to Ms. Sinsuan, walked her five meters away and
then told her not to interfere.  Then he
went back to the two quarreling inmates, pulled a gun suddenly from his waist,
and shot them one after another twice.  A fifth shot was supposedly fired but the trial court did not consider
the same as it has not been sufficiently established in the record.  Fearing that Balanon was running amok, Ms.
Sinsuan ran back to where she was previously sitting.  Ms. de la Cruz, who was then six months pregnant, remained seated
on the bench as the startling occurrence unfolded before them.  The shaken tutors then proceeded on their
way to the City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later at six o'clock in the evening, Sgt. Balanon was picked up
by some ten members of the 36th Infantry Batallion in connection with the
killing of Laino and Santillan.  Subsequently, Balanon was charged with murder on two counts, both
qualified by evident premeditation <span style="">and
treachery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sgt. Balanon set up the
defense of alibi and mistaken identity.  He claimed he was "delivering information to an intelligence
community."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 31 October 1985, Judge Carlito A. Bibna of the Regional Trial
Court of Zamboanga City, Br. 13, convicted Sgt. Balanon of the crime charged
qualified by treachery and sentenced him to two terms of <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="">, </span>to indemnify the heirs of the
victims at P30,000.00 for each case, and to pay the costs.  As a detention prisoner, he was credited in
full for the period of his detention.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The crux of the decision
leaned on the credibility of witnesses -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>As compared to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses,
particularly Luningning Sinsuan, Elsa de la Cruz and Rogene Acasio <span style="">who </span>testified in straightforward,
spontaneous and frank manner and has answered consistently even on
cross-examination, the vacillating and evasive answers of the accused Sgt.
Jerry Balanon during the course of <span style="">his </span>testimony
does not inspire belief and reliability.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation <span style="">was </span>not appreciated against Sgt.
Balanon as "[t]here is no evidence on record to show when the plan to kill
the deceased-victims was hatched by the accused <span style="">x x x x"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present recourse, accused-appellant basically raises
factual issues.  He stresses his
presence at the SOUTHCOM headquarters in the morning of 3 November 1980,
contrary to the testimony of prosecution witness Rogene Acasio, also an inmate,
that he was drinking liquor with Balanon and the victims.  Appellant's alibi cannot stand in the face
of his clear and positive identification by Acasio who, appellant even
admitted, had no ill will to implicate him (Balanon) in the crime.  Moreover, there is no compelling reason to
depart from the assessment of the credibility of the witnesses made by the
trial judge who, unlike the reviewing court, had the occasion and opportunity
to observe their demeanor and detect any badge of fabrication.  But even granting <i>arguendo</i>
appellant's claim to be true, this does not contradict the testimonies of other
prosecution witnesses that he shot the victims to death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant faults the trial court for giving credence to the
testimony of Acasio who was not only probably drunk, but was a convicted
hijacker and falsifier of public documents as well; hence, apt to fabricate his
testimony.  But, probability is not
evidence, and even if Acasio took alcohol, it does not follow that he was
drunk.  Moreover, a drunk person is
competent to testify on what he sees or experiences, however limited or hazy
his perception may be.  In the same way,
a hijacker or a falsifier is not necessarily <span style="">a liar.  Under the Rules of
Court, conviction of a crime, unless otherwise provided by law, shall not be a
ground for disqualification of witnesses.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's assertion that the victims being prisoners could not
have left the Penal Colony without the permission of the warden, is completely
irrelevant for they were admittedly shot and killed outside the prison walls.</p>

<p class="BODY">While appellant denies having ordered a certain handicraft
product from Acasio,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> by
reason of which Acasio claims to have known him, appellant nonetheless admits
that most of the living-out prisoners knew him there because he used to pass by
that place.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The distinction sought to be made by appellant is too trivial to affect the
testimony of Acasio.  After all, he
(Balanon) does not deny that Acasio knows him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that he is not the assailant described by
prosecution witness Sinsuan since he does not have any wound or stitches<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
as confirmed by the prosecutor who "was not able to see any scar"
behind his ears.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be worth noting that -</p>

<blockquote>x x x x Sometimes in the course of time a scar may apparently
disappear - that is to say, not be noticeable to the casual observer - but it
is always there, to be found by him who looks carefully.  By compressing the surface where the scar is
suspected, so as to expel the blood supply and then releasing it suddenly, the
blood rushing back will generally show an old scar very plainly, where before
it could not be noticed.  Thus also,
where a person has been branded as well as where a scar has become invisible,
by slapping the part several times or by rubbing it, the scar or brand may be
made visible x x x x Scars decrease in size after time in an adult, but
increase in size in a child <span style="">x </span>x
x x<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As observed by the
Solicitor General:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x x x it was only in June 1985 that appellant showed his
long-haired head for a cursory look, to the prosecuting fiscal, or almost five
(5) years after the commission of the crime.  The Sworn Statement of Mrs. Luningning Sinsuan was taken on November 18,
1980.  Appellant was already under
investigation at the time.  Why did he
not claim at once that he had no scar, and instead alleged it for the first
time after almost five (5) years?  Why
did he not let a doctor examine his head and certify as to the presence or
absence of a scar?  The answer is
obvious, his scar would have been very obvious at that time, even to an
untrained eye.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In her Sworn Statement,
Luningning simply described the assailant as "tall about 5'7" above,
medium or little slim, fair complexion, slit eyes, plain long hair (minus
haircut along the wound with stitches,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and nothing was categorically said about the
location of the wound.  Since Luningning
was describing appellant's hair when she took exception to a then visible
haircut bordering a wound, said wound could have been on appellant's pate or
head which, when the prosecutor took a look behind appellant's ears, could have
been hidden by his long hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But even granting </span><i><span style="">arguendo</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">that Luningning made
incorrect statements about the wound, this pales in comparison with her and De
la Cruz' positive identification of appellant on the stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant also discredits
prosecution witness Elsa de la Cruz by highlighting her alleged inconsistent
statements, i.e., she allegedly averred that she got </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">close view of the accused when she was still boarding the bus, but on
cue from the prosecutor, she said she was already on board the bus, to wit,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x x   What was the basis for your identification of
the accused Jerry Balanon?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I identified him because when we already
boarded the bus with Mrs. Sinsuan he went near Mrs. Sinsuan and Mrs. Sinsuan
was stepping one step (on) the bus and he was very near Mrs. Sinsuan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Asst. City Fiscal Yu:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How far was he when
you saw him when you were about to board the bus?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Very near.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How many meters?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If Mrs. Sinsuan was stepping then I am at the
back of Mrs. Sinsuan.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Ms. de la Cruz could be referring to two instances when accused
came close to Ms. Sinsuan, i.e., when the latter was already inside the bus and
when she was still boarding the bus, and the follow-up question of the
prosecutor referred to the instance when the witnesses were still
boarding.  But even if we consider as
inconsistent this portion of Ms. de la Cruz' testimony, this is too trivial to
affect their straightforward account of the shooting of the victims by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it may be unnatural for a person who has just committed a
grave felony to walk back and forth and approach bystanders amiably instead of
fleeing, criminal acts are aberrations and criminals are not expected to act
naturally, especially in this case where the crime was committed in front of
several witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant tries to
revitalize the testimony of defense witness Rolando Daño who claimed not to
have seen any teacher nor heard shots at the scene of the crime, which account
the trial court disregarded because he admitted that he did not know all the
teachers of Labuan Barangay High School and that he went to the scene only
after the shooting was over.  But
appellant takes exception to the damaging parts of Daño's testimony, especially
the statement that he saw the accused Sgt. Jerry Balanon coming out from the
Orellano store in Labuan at three o'clock in the afternoon and stood there
akimbo,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> explaining that Daño could not have been
precise in stating the time because -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sgt. Daño was not wearing a watch on that particular day.  Hence, when he testified under oath that he
did not hear the shots x x x the only plausible explanation was that he was not
in the vicinity of the crime scene at the time the killings were
committed.  He only became aware of the
crime <u>after</u> everyone else in the locality knew of the same x x x x
Undoubtedly then, his estimate of the time that he saw Balanon come out of the
Orellano store was wrong.  Yet the
falsity of the testimony itself was never established.  He did in fact see Balanon at the scene
after the crime was committed.  This,
however, should not be used as a basis to totally discredit Balanon's
testimony.  Balanon himself was not
wearing a watch on that day.  Consequently, his estimate of the time he reached Labuan could likewise
be wrong.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the testimony of
defense witness Daño did not do any good to appellant's cause, the latter now
belabors </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">justify every unfavorable statement made by
said witness.  But even if we totally
disregard the statements of Daño, appellant himself, as pointed out by the
Solicitor General, admitted at one point that he left the SOUTHCOM at about one
o'clock in the afternoon,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> contrary to his statement that he never left
the SOUTHCOM until four-thirty in the afternoon.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Interestingly, since appellant admitted that
he and his witness Daño could not be expected to be precise in their estimates
of the time, it naturally follows that appellant could not also state with
precision that at about three o'clock that afternoon he was not at the scene of
the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The qualifying circumstance of treachery is not disputed since
the victims were suddenly shot, unexpectedly, and were not in a position to
defend themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While the </span><span style="">victims </span><span style="">were using their bare fists to settle their differences, the accused
used </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">deadly firearm to silence them.  Appellant's guilt having been established
beyond reasonable doubt, the affirmance of his conviction is imperative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the court <i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>finding accused-appellant SGT. JERRY BALANON GUILTY of Murder
