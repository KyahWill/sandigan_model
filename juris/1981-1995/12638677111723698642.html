				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for prohibition, petitioner seeks the issuance
of an order or writ of prohibition which would direct public respondents
Administrative Action Board and Chairman <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> to permanently desist from assuming jurisdiction
over Adm. Case No. AAB-034-88 until the same is finally disposed of by the
Telecoms Office, Region V at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and to refrain from issuing
orders setting the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case for hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner substantially assails the Resolution dated September
30, 1988 of then Secretary <span class="SpellE">Rainerio</span> O. Reyes of the
Department of Transportation and Communications which suspended her for one
year and disqualified her for promotion for a period of one year and also, the
Order of July 5, 1989 of Chairman <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> of the Administrative Action Board of said
department which set Adm. Case No. <span class="GramE">AAB-034-88 for trial.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prefatory facts are:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1987</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> B. Arroyo, OIC/CDO, <st1:place><st1:placename>Message</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> and then CDO of Telecom
Office stationed at <span class="SpellE">Buhi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, filed a complaint for Dishonesty Thru
Falsification (Multiple) of Official.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Documents against Maria B. <span class="SpellE">Lupo</span>, herein
petitioner, as Chief of Personnel Section, Telecom Office, <span class="GramE">Region</span>
V at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was based on the alleged
exclusion of several names from the Certification (on the list of employees)
submitted by petitioner in compliance with a Confidential Memorandum of
Director <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid complaint was actually triggered off by the inquiry
of Ignacio B. Arroyo, brother of complainant <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span>
B. Arroyo, into the alleged illegal termination of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
niece, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> Arroyo <span class="SpellE">Noceda</span>,
as a daily wage clerk at <span class="SpellE">Buhi</span> Telecom Exchange in <span class="SpellE">Camarinea</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, in violation of a
contract previously entered into between a certain Gloria D. Palermo, lot donor
and former Bureau Director <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, <span class="SpellE">donee</span> of the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lot is located at Sta. Clara, <span class="SpellE">Buhi</span> on which the Telecom Office was to be
constructed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This inquiry of Ignacio B.
Arroyo was dismissed for lack of merit on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the basis for the complaint of <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> Arroyo from whom Ignacio sought assistance was
petitioner's exclusion of certain names of newly hired employees in Region V
who appeared related to certain ranking officials of the region, for the
purpose of keeping under wraps the appointment of said employees from Ignacio
Arroyo who had previously complained of the alleged illegal termination of his
niece <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Noceda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner had to falsify the list which she
submitted in compliance with Regional Director <span class="SpellE">Morante's</span>
Confidential Memorandum to the alleged prejudice of <span class="SpellE">Noceda</span>
and for the purpose of protecting her future interest in the sense that those
excluded (who should have been included) were close relatives of ranking
officials of the Telecommunications Office of Region V Telecom Investigator <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calapano</span>, acting on the
unverified complaint of <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> Arroyo, conducted
an informal fact-finding inquiry and came out with a Memorandum recommending
that petitioner be sternly warned that a repetition of a similar offense in the
future would be dealt with more drastically and that the case should be
considered closed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based solely on the aforesaid Memorandum, the Secretary of the
Department of Transportation and Communications handed down a Resolution on
September 30, 1988 finding petitioner "guilty as charged‚Äù and suspending
her for one year and disqualifying her for promotion for a period of one
year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved for
reconsideration of the resolution but the same was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She thus appealed the resolution and order of
denial of the motion for reconsideration to the Civil Service Commission for
review, anchoring her appeal on lack of due process in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1989</st1:date>,
the Civil Service Commission, thru its Merit Systems Board, issued the Order
setting aside the resolution of the Department of Transportation and
Communications and remanding the case to the Telecom Office of Region V for
further investigation to conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the procedural
requirements of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of <span class="GramE">complying</span> the above order,
respondent Chairman <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> of the AAB issued the
Order of <st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1989</st1:date>
setting the case for trial on <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="8">August 3,
 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1989</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Manifestation and Motion informing respondent <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> that no formal charge had been instituted by the
Telecommunications Office against her and respondents, therefore, had no
jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
denied said manifestation and motion for lack of merit in the Order of <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1989</st1:date> and again set the case
for hearing on <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner avers that respondent AAB never acquired jurisdiction
over Adm. Case No. <span class="GramE">AAB-034-88 because of the absence of a
formal charge against her and that the proceedings conducted by Regional
Investigator <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calapano</span>
was a mere fact-finding inquiry.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Chairman of the AAB, however, contends that the Order
of the Merit Systems Board of the Civil Service Commission was rendered without
lawful authority since petitioner's appeal to said Board was filed when the
assailed resolution had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>;
that the Board, not having acquired jurisdiction to entertain the appeal for
having been filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period
could not have legally rendered its decision in the said administrative
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, respondents claim that
Regional Office No. V could no longer take cognizance of the case as per order
of the Merit Systems Board for the reason that the decision had already become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complaints against employees, like petitioner herein, who belong
to the Civil Service Career <span class="GramE">System</span> are still governed
by P.D. No. 807.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This mandate of P.D.
No. 807 has been recognized and implemented by respondent Administrative Action
Board when it declared in Office Order No. 88-318 dated <st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1988</st1:date> that the <u>Board</u> <u>shall</u> <u>observe</u>
<u>the</u> <u>pertinent</u> <u>civil</u> <u>rules</u> <u>and</u> <u>policies</u>
<u>designed</u> <u>to</u> <u>expedite</u> <u>action</u> <u>on cases</u> <u>referred</u>
<u>to</u> <u>it</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring
supplied) </p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
Civil Service Law read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 37.</span> Disciplinary
Jurisdiction<span class="GramE">.-</span> (a) The Commission shall decide upon
appeal all administrative disciplinary cases involving the imposition of a
penalty of suspension for more than thirty days, or fine in an amount exceeding
thirty days salary, demotion in rank or salary or transfer, removal or
dismissal from office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A complaint may
be filed directly with the Commission by a private citizen against a government
official or employee in which case it may hear and decide the case or it may
deputize any department or agency or official or group of officials to conduct
the investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The results of the
investigation shall be submitted to the Commission with recommendation as to
the penalty to be imposed or other action to be taken.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) The heads
of departments, agencies and instrumentalities, provinces, cities and
municipalities shall have jurisdiction to investigate and decide matters
involving disciplinary action against officers and employees under their jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their decisions shall be final in case the
penalty imposed is suspension for not more than thirty days or fine in an
amount not exceeding thirty days salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In case the decision rendered by a bureau or office head is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Commission, the same may be initially
appealed to the department and finally to the Commission and pending appeal,
the same shall be <span class="SpellE">executory</span> except when the penalty
is removal, in which case the same shall be <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
only after confirmation by the department head.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>An investigation may be entrusted to regional
director or similar officials who shall make the necessary report and
recommendation to the chief of bureau or office or department within the period
specified in Paragraph (d) of the following Section.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>An appeal shall not stop the decision from
being <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and in case the penalty is
suspension or removal, the respondent shall be considered as having been under
preventive suspension during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
appeal in the event he wins an appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 38.</span> Procedure in
Administrative Cases Against Non?Presidential Appointees<span class="GramE">.-</span> (a) Administrative proceedings may be commenced against a
subordinate officer or employee by the head of department or office of
equivalent rank, or head of local government, or chiefs of agencies, or
regional directors, or upon sworn, written complaint of any other persons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In the case of a complaint filed by any other
persons, the complainant shall submit sworn statements covering his testimony
and those of his witnesses together with his documentary evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If on the basis of such papers a <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> case is found not to exist, the disciplining authority shall
dismiss the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
case exists, he shall notify the respondent in writing, of the charges against
the latter, to which shall be attached copies of the complaint, sworn
statements and other documents submitted, and the respondent shall be allowed
not less than seventy-two hours after receipt of the complaint to answer the
charges in writing under oath, together with supporting sworn statements and
documents, in which he shall indicate whether or not he elects a formal
investigation if his answer is not considered satisfactory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the answer is found satisfactory, the
disciplining authority shall dismiss the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Although a respondent does not request a
formal investigation, one shall nevertheless be conducted when from the
allegations of the complaint and the answer of the respondent, including the
supporting documents, the merits of the case cannot be decided judiciously
without conducting such an investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contentions appear meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that under Section 37 (b) as <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>, the decisions of heads of departments become
final only in cases where the penalty imposed is suspension for not more than
thirty (30) days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty (30) days
salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case, therefore, of petitioner
who had been made to suffer the penalty of suspension for one (1) year, such
penalty should not have been implemented without the appeal to the Civil
Service Commission for proper review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notably, paragraph (a) of the above Section explicitly provides
that the Commission shall decide upon appeal all administrative disciplinary
cases involving the imposition of a penalty of suspension for more than 30
days, or fine in an amount exceeding 30 days salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the enforcement of the penalty imposed
upon petitioner under the resolution of the Secretary of the Department of
Transportation and Communications was premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the very start, the basis upon which this case was
investigated had been defective and irregular.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For, the letter-complaint of <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> Arroyo
was not verified and yet, the name was haphazardly made the basis of the
informal inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be stressed
that par. (a) <span class="GramE">of</span> Sec. 38 mandates that administrative
proceedings may be commenced against an employee by the head of the department
or office of equivalent rank or upon <u>sworn</u> <u>written</u> <u>complaint</u>
of any other person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should also be
noted that under paragraph (b) of said Section, a respondent is given the
option to elect a formal investigation of the charge against him if his answer
is not found satisfactory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of petitioner, it appears that when her answer to the unverified complaint was
found unsatisfactory, she was never given a chance to decide whether or not to
submit <span class="GramE">herself</span> to a formal investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Memorandum of Telecom Investigator <span class="SpellE">Calapano</span>
to the Regional Director is merely recommendatory since it was only the outcome
of a fact finding investigation based on the unverified complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that the informal investigation was only
an inquiry into the alleged dishonest acts of petitioner in which case, the
Memorandum could not be made as the basis for any final resolution of the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legal and proper procedure
should have been for the Regional Director of Region V, the alter ego of the
department <span class="GramE">secretary <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>to</span> initiate the formal complaint on the
basis of the results of the inquiry of the Telecom Investigator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of observing the mandatory rules on
formal investigations as prescribed by PD No. 807, the DOTC Secretary cut
corners and apparently railroaded this case by rendering the assailed
resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even the Telecom Investigator did not know what he was
doing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He exceeded his authority by
imposing in the Memorandum a penalty in the form of a warning to
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His job was limited to an
inquiry into the facts and a determination on whether or not a prima facie case
existed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His findings were merely
preparatory to the filing of the necessary formal administrative case by the
Regional Director.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted with alarm that the Telecom Director who was
supposed to review the findings of the Telecom Investigator merely affixed his
approval within the Memorandum (p. 7 of Memorandum), thus obviously indicating
that he never reviewed the merits of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears highly irregular that Asst. Secretary <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> of the DOTC, in his letter dated <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1989</st1:date> to Chairman <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>
of the Administrative Action Board, informed the latter that his Office did not
file any administrative complaint against petitioner nor had it filed a formal
charge against her for whatever administrative offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that even with this <span class="GramE">letter,</span>
Chairman <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> proceeded to order the hearing of
this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is <span class="GramE">a
clear indication that for lack of coordination among the DOTC authorities and
the Regional Office, the mandatory requirements of due process to which
petitioner was entitled were</span> irreverently ignored.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the case of Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span class="SpellE">Colege</span> v. National Labor Relations Commission (G.R. No.
65482, December 1, 1987) this Court reiterated the "cardinal primary"
requirements of due process in administrative proceedings and these are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the right to a hearing which includes the
right to present one's case and submit evidence in support thereof; (2) the
tribunal must consider the evidence presented; (3) the decision must have
something to support itself; (4) the evidence must be substantial, and
substantial evidence means such evidence as a reasonable mind must accept as
adequate to support a conclusion; (5) <u>the</u> <u>decision</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u>
<u>based</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>evidence</u> <u>presented</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u>
<u>hearing</u>, or at least contained in the record and disclosed to the
parties affected; (6) the tribunal or body or any of its judges must act on its
or <u>his</u> <u>own</u> <u>independent</u> <u>consideration</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>law</u> <u>and</u> <u>facts</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>controversy,</u> <u>and</u>
<u>not</u> <u>simply</u> <u>accept</u> <u>the</u> <u>view</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u>
<u>subordinate</u>; (7) the board or body should in all controversial
questions, render its decision in such manner that the parties to the
proceeding can know the various issues involved, and the reason for the
decision rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Underlining
supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, respondents denied petitioner her right <span class="GramE">to a formal and full-blown administrative proceedings</span> which
she never had.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1988</st1:date> of the Secretary of the
Department of Transportation and Communications and the proceedings before the
Administrative Action Board are hereby declared NULL and VOID.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of the DOTC is hereby directed
