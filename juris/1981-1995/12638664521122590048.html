<p class="2Q">"SO ORDERED."</p>

<p class="BODY">An information was filed by the Second Assistant Fiscal Alberto
G. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> at the Regional Trial Court, First
Judicial Region, Branch V, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City on December 3,
1985 charging the accused, Dante Marcos y <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>, of
violation of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425 (Sale and
Distribution of Prohibited Drugs), having been committed as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"That on or about the 4th day of December, 1985, in the City
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, and without any authority of
law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and
distribute dried marijuana leaves weighing about nine (9) kilos, more or less,
contained in a big sack, for P700.00 per kilo or a total of P6,300.00, <span class="SpellE">Phiippine</span> Currency, knowing fully well that said leaves of
marijuana is a prohibited drug in violation of the above-mentioned provision of
law.</p>

<p class="2Q">"CONTRARY TO LAW."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused entered a plea of not guilty and
trial on the merits ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered from the records, Major <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Junio</span>, Commanding Officer of the First Narcotic
Regional Unit, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, acting upon an information
given by a confidential informer that accused-appellant Dante Marcos was
selling marijuana at the Holy Ghost Hill Proper, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, organized on December 4, 1985 a "buy bust" operation team
composed of A2C <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span>
who was to pose as the buyer of the prohibited stuff, with Major <span class="SpellE">Junio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Peralta, Freddie <span class="SpellE">Cortel</span> and Philip de Vera providing the back-up support (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 58-59).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony of this team which eventually apprehended the accused,
constitutes the major part of the prosecution's evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented the testimonies of the following
witnesses:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Lt.</u> <u>Carlos</u> <u>V.</u> <u>Figueroa</u>, a forensic
chemist at the PC Crime Laboratory, Camp <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span>, La
Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, testified that on January 2, 1986,
he received a request for laboratory examination dated December 16, 1985
(Hearing of March 18, 1986; TSN, p. 3; Record, p. 4) for nine (9) bundles of
marijuana stuff, weighing 9.2 kilos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
examined the same by means of the <span class="SpellE">Duquenois</span>-Levine
test and the thin-layer chromatography test.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both tests showed that the bundles were positive for marijuana (Hearing
of March 18, 1986; TSN, p. 4; Records, pp. 5-6).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>A2C</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Serafin</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Artizona</u></span>, a soldier, assigned at the 1st Regional
Narcotics Command, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, testified that on
December 4, 1985, he was assigned by his immediate chief Major <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Junio</span> to compose a team
to entrap accused Dante Marcos in the Holy Ghost Proper (Hearing of April 28,
1986; TSN, pp. 13-14; Records, pp. 14-15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, together with the confidential informer they went to the
Holy Ghost Proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also
accompanied by the back-up team strategically positioned within the vicinity,
namely Major <span class="SpellE">Junio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
Peralta, Freddie <span class="SpellE">Cortel</span> and Philip de Vera (Hearing
of April 28, 1986; TSN, pp. 14-15; Records, pp. 15-16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once at the Holy Ghost Proper, he was
introduced by the confidential informer as a buyer of marijuana to the accused
who was then standing at the stairway together with his companion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, they were asked to proceed to
the second floor (Hearing of April 28, 1986; TSN, pp. 20-22; Records, pp.
21-23).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then ordered ten (10) kilos
of marijuana priced at seven hundred pesos per kilo (P700.00).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused left the room to get the stuff,
and returned with a light blue sack and gave it to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After inspecting the contents of the
aforesaid sack, he gave the preÂ­arranged signal to his companion by spitting
through the window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
back-up team went inside the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, he introduced himself to the accused as a NARCOM agent
(Hearing of April 28, 1986; TSN, pp. 16-17; Records, pp. 17-18).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the accused was arrested while
his companion was able to evade the arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also testified that he did not execute any affidavit to support his
complaint against the accused (Hearing of April 28, 1986; TSN, p. 18; Records,
p. 19).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Pat.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Maximiano</u></span> <u>Peralta</u>,
an investigator of the 1st Narcotics Regional Unit, testified that on December,
1985, he was a member of the back-up team of A2C <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span>
who negotiated with the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
rushed to the house when Major <span class="SpellE">Junio</span> who posted
himself near the house of the accused gave the pre-arranged signal that the
accused was already held by A2C <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> (Hearing of January 14, 1987; TSN, pp. 31-32;
Records, pp. 32-33).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside the house,
he saw <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> holding the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further disclosed that the sack contained
ten (10) bundles of marijuana weighing more or less 9-1/2 kilos (Hearing of
January 14, 1987; TSN, pp. 33-34; Records, pp. 34-35).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he testified that he was the one
who prepared the affidavit of arrest and other supporting papers (Hearing of
January 14, 1987; TSN, pp. 34-35; Records, pp. 35-36).</p>

<p class="BODY">With the presentation of the oral testimonies of the witnesses by
the prosecution and the documentary evidence which consist of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) Letter-request for laboratory examination
dated December 16, 1985, signed by Murphy <span class="SpellE">Bugtong</span>,
Chief of Narcotics Division, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City Police
Station (Exhibit "A", Original Record, p. 195); (b) Blue sack which
contained marijuana leaves (Exhibits "B" - "B-10", <u>ibid</u>.,
p. 196; (c) Chemistry Report (Exhibit "C", <u>ibid</u>., p. 197); (d)
Sketch (Exhibit "D", <u>ibid</u>., p. 198); (e) Joint Affidavit
(Exhibit "E", <u>ibid</u>., p. 199); as well as the physical
evidence, the prosecution rested its case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presented the accused <u>Dante</u>
<u>Marcos</u> as its principal witness who vehemently denied the accusation
against him and claimed instead that the sack of marijuana belonged to a
certain Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that he was a security guard of the <st1:city><st1:place>Freeport</st1:place></st1:city>
and Vito Security Agency and an Architectural drafting student at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was boarding at the ground floor of <st1:street><st1:address>No.
  23-C <span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, a
two-storey boarding house owned by <span class="SpellE">Melita</span> <span class="SpellE">Adase</span> (Hearing of August 24, 1987; TSN, pp. 2-3; Records,
pp. 74-75).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1985</st1:date>, he went to his class until <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 p.m.</st1:time><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he went to his boarding house and reviewed for his last
subject at <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 p.m.</st1:time> (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 4-5; 15; Records, pp. 76-77; 87).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, while reviewing, Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span>, a
student from <span class="SpellE">Kalinga-Apayao</span> who was occupying a room
on the second floor (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 4; Records, p. 76) knocked at his door
and asked him to go to his (Roland's) room to entertain his visitors as he was
to go somewhere for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
he went to Roland's room, and there met Roland's visitors, an American, a
Filipino and a Negro boy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
introduced to the three visitors and then Roland left (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 5-7;
Records, pp. 77-79).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ten (10) minutes
after, Roland returned carrying a big sack which he brought near the bed which
was hidden from his view by a curtain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Roland then called for the Negro boy who in turn called for the
American.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the American saw the
contents of the sack he overheard him say, "Okay, I'll pay it", at the
same time brought out his money as he emerged from behind the curtain (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 7-8; Records, pp. 79-80).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that as Roland was sitting on his bed he was called by the Filipino
visitor, who held the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
also called by the same visitor who held his hands saying, "Relax <span class="SpellE">lang</span> kayo, this is NARCOM." He saw the Negro boy jump
out of the window while panicked-stricken Roland tried to free himself from the
hands of the Filipino, but the Filipino visitor pulled them both outside the
door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they were near the stairs
Roland was able to free himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Roland
ran downstairs and fled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, he
heard a shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Filipino held on to
him while the American went back to the room and got the sack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, accompanied by the Filipino and the
American, they were met by two male persons at the foot of the stairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was pulled inside a vehicle and brought to
the police station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further declared
that once inside the said vehicle, he heard one of them say, "Hindi <span class="SpellE">ito</span> <span class="SpellE">talaga</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
target <span class="SpellE">natin</span>, <span class="SpellE">yong</span> <span class="SpellE">nakatakbo</span>." (Hearing of August 24, 1987; TSN, pp.
8-10,; Records, pp. 80-82).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further
stated that A2C <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span>
was not one of the visitors of Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He and Pat. Peralta were never at the
boarding house during the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
also claimed that the sketch of the place as presented by A2C <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> is erroneous (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 12; Record, p. 84)
and insisted that his only purpose in going to the room of Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span> was to entertain the latter's visitors.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross examination, the accused admitted that he came to know
Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span> only on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their relationship was casual and he had been to the room of <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span> for the second time only on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1985</st1:date>, the day of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Renato</u></span> <u>Padua</u>, a law
student at the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Colleges Foundation, testified
and corroborated the testimony of the accused that at about 3:30 to 4:00
o'clock p.m. of December 4, 1987, he was reading in the second floor of No.
23-D Holy Ghost Proper, about 1.5 meters from No. 23-C where the accused Dante
Marcos lived (Hearing of March 11, 1987; TSN, pp. 1-5; Record, pp. 49-53); that
on the said afternoon he heard a commotion at 23-C which was followed by
successive stamping of feet going down to the first floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He went out from his room and stayed at the
porch of his boarding house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, he
saw Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span>, a boarder of 23-C running toward
a small alley (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.7-10; Record, pp. 55-58).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, he saw two persons who were then
standing fire a shot into the air (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 10; Record, p. 58).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the two men came down to 23-C and
met the accused (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 11; Record, p. 59).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, the accused was being held
by a certain man followed by an American holding a sack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, they boarded a jeep and then left (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 11-14; Records, pp. 59-61).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the defense presented <u>Raul</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bayangdan</u></span>,
an AB-BSE student at <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Colleges Foundation, a
board mate and province mate of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that he has been a boarder at the first floor of <st1:street><st1:address>23-C
  Holy Ghost St.</st1:address></st1:street> from June 1984 to March 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He corroborated the testimony of the accused
as to the boarders of that house including Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span>
and his sister Anita.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He declared that
he came to know about the incident from <span class="SpellE">Melita</span> <span class="SpellE">Adasen</span> and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Padua, a neighbor,
when he went home from school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also
learned that Roland <span class="SpellE">Bayogan</span> ran away and never
returned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asserted that he has no
knowledge of the incident except that which has been told to him (Hearing of
February 8, 1988; TSN, pp. 2-9; Records, pp. 94-100).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave more weight to the evidence of the
prosecution and found the accused-appellant Dante Marcos guilty as charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1988</st1:date>,
accused-appellant through his counsel filed his brief (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 35), while on <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1989</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief was filed (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 54).</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue of this case is whether or not there is
instigation or entrapment of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that there was an instigation or even frame up
and not a real entrapment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
"buy-bust" operation team who went to the place does not know the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the alleged buyer had
to be introduced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no marijuana
yet when the authorities came or when the alleged poseur buyer came to buy the
prohibited drug.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the accused was
not about to commit a crime or committing a crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span>, the poseur
buyer, was clear and convincing and demonstrated that the accused needed no
instigation or prodding to commit a crime he would not otherwise have
committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Noteworthy is the fact that
the accused, as gathered from the records, had a ready supply of marijuana for
sale and disposition to anyone willing to pay the price asked for the
prohibited material.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the acts of
the arresting officers here constituted entrapment, a process not prohibited by
the Revised Penal Code (People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 77588, May 12, 1989; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, G.R. No. 71838, February 26, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that in instigation, where the officers of the
law or their agents incite, induce, instigate or lure an accused into
committing an offense, which he otherwise would not commit and has no intention
of committing, the accused cannot be held liable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But in entrapment, where the criminal intent
or design to commit the offense charged originates from the mind of the accused
and law enforcement officials merely facilitate the commission of the offense,
the accused cannot justify his conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instigation is a "trap for the unwary innocent".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Entrapment is a trap for the unwary criminal
(Cabrera v. Judge <span class="SpellE">Pajares</span>, Adm. Mat. R-278-RTJ &amp;
R-309-RTJ, <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1986</st1:date>, En
Banc, Per <span class="SpellE">Curiam</span>, 142 SCRA 124).</p>

<p class="BODY">In entrapment, the entrapper resorts to ways and means to trap
and capture a lawbreaker while executing his criminal plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, in instigation the
instigator practically induces the would-be defendant into committing the
offense, and himself becomes a co-principal (People v. <span class="SpellE">Natipravat</span>,
<span class="SpellE">inpra</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Entrapment is no bar to prosecution and conviction while in instigation,
the defendant would have to be acquitted (People v. <span class="SpellE">Lapatha</span>,
167 SCRA 159).</p>

<p class="BODY">The difference in the nature of the two lies in the origin of the
criminal intent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In entrapment, the
means originates from the mind of the criminal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The idea and the resolve to commit the crime come from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In instigation, the law enforcer conceives
the commission of the crime and suggests to the accused who adopts the idea and
carries it into execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legal
effects of entrapment do not exempt the criminal from liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instigation does (<span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 142 SCRA 534 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that the authorities deceived the appellants into
believing that the former were buyers of heroin does not exculpate the latter
from liability for selling the prohibited drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police can legitimately feign
solicitation to catch criminals who habitually engage in the commission of the
offense (People v. <span class="SpellE">Natipravat</span>, 145 SCRA 483 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as noted by this Court, the defense that the accused
was framed by the apprehending officer can be easily fabricated and not
acceptable for accused being a drug pusher or seller almost always uses such
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>,
154 SCRA 694 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the defense of
having set up or framed up to prosper, the evidence adduced must be clear and
convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like alibi, it is a weak
defense, that is easy to concoct and is difficult to prove (People v. <span class="SpellE">Nabunat</span>, No. 84392, February 7, 1990, First Division, <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, J.).</p>

<p class="BODY">But the more important consideration is the fact that the
appellant was positively identified by the prosecution witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This should prevail over his denial and <span class="SpellE">inadmission</span> of having committed the crime for which he was
charged, since greater weight is generally accorded to the positive testimony
of the prosecution witnesses than the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
denial (People v. de Jesus, 145 SCRA 52 [1986]; People v. Khan, 161 SCRA 406
[1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span>, G.R. No. 71681, September
5, 1989).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As between the positive
declaration of the prosecution witnesses and the negative statement of the
accused, the former deserves more credence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span>,
G.R. No. 75268, 157 SCRA 718; People v. <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span>, G.R.
No. 71861, September 5, 1989).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
even if the appellant denied the participation in the crime, his presence
during the negotiation and actual delivery indicates a common purpose with
other accused to sell marijuana (People v. <span class="SpellE">Natipravat</span>,
supra).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the findings of the trial court are as
follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
pretension that he went to Roland's room that afternoon of <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1985</st1:date> only to entertain the latter's
visitors lacks appeal to reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering his own admission that he met Roland only on November 15,
1985; that he had gone to Roland's room only once before<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>December 4, 1985; that they are not even <span class="SpellE">townmates</span> as Roland is from <span class="SpellE">Kalinga-Apayao</span>
while the accused is from Pinged, <span class="SpellE">Sabangan</span>, Mt.
Province, there is simply no discernible special relationship between them that
could have moved Roland to pick on the accused as his surrogate to entertain
his visitors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the accused
had a scheduled examination at <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 o'clock</st1:time>
for which he had to review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why should
he accede to Roland's request and thereby lose precious time he badly needed
for his review?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To top it all, even as
Roland had already returned to attend to his visitors, the accused still did
not leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court is thus inclined to
believe that Roland and the accused were together that afternoon because both
were engaged in the illegal trafficking of marijuana."</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be pointed out that ownership and possession are not
indispensable elements of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
mere act of selling or even acting as broker in the sale of marijuana and other
prohibited drugs consummates the crime (People v. <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>,
147 SCRA 123 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore <span class="SpellE">Artizona's</span> testimony was
corroborated by the "buy-bust" operation team especially Pat. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Peralta who confirmed that appellant was truly a
marijuana dealer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The commission of the
offense of illegal sale of marijuana requires merely the consummation of the
selling transaction (People v. <span class="SpellE">Macuto</span>, G.R. No.
80112, August 25, 1989).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, the appellant handed over the blue sack containing the ten kilos of
marijuana upon the agreement with <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> to
exchange it for money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances
show that there was an agreement between the poseur-buyer and the appellant to
consummate the sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the
appellant returned with the amount of marijuana corresponding to the aforesaid
price suffices to constitute if not sale, then delivery or giving away to
another and distribution of the prohibited drug punishable under Section 4,
Article 11 of Republic Act 6425 (People v. Rodriguez, April 25, 1989, G.R. No.
81332; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, G.R. No. 81520, February 21,
1989).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is important is the fact
that the poseur-buyer received the marijuana from the appellant and that the
contents were presented as evidence in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Proof of the transaction suffices (People v. <span class="SpellE">Macuto</span>,
supra).</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can the appellant aver that no consideration or payment
was made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, supra, this Court held that so long as the
marijuana actually given by the appellant was presented before the lower court
the absence of the marked money does not create a hiatus in the prosecution's
evidence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, G.R. No. 81332, April 25,
1989).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Recently, this Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q">"It is true that police officers did not have the amount of
P1,600 with them to buy marijuana from the appellants during the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, it was not indispensable
for their operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> went through the motion as a buyer and his offer
was accepted by the appellants who produced and delivered the marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no need to hand the marked money to
the appellants in the payment thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The crime was consummated by the delivery of the goods." (People v.
<span class="SpellE">Galtong</span>-o, 168 SCRA 716 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged contradiction in the date of the affidavit or the
fact that prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> and Peralta
did not know the number and owner of the raided house will not impair their
testimonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no cogent reason
for the witnesses to know the number nor the owner of the house at Holy Ghost
Hills in <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
because <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> who posed as a buyer was accompanied
by a confidential informer, who was familiar with the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been ruled that contradictions in the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses not on material points is not fatal
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Pulo</span>, 147 SCRA 551 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctrinal jurisprudence has consistently
held that minor contradictions are to be expected but must be disregarded if
they do not affect the basic credibility of the evidence as a whole (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>, 148 SCRA 178; People v. <span class="SpellE">Natipravat</span>,
145 SCRA 483; People v. <span class="SpellE">Reriodica</span>, Jr., September 29,
1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">Conversely, the actuations of the appellant during his arrest
during which he did not make a protest, indicates his guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unusually submissive stance of the appellant
after his entrapment and absence of vigorous protest when he was arrested,
destroy his alleged innocence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>,
supra).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant failed to show that the police officers were actuated
by any improper motive in testifying as they did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the records to suggest
that the arrest was motivated by any reason other than the desire of the police
officers to accomplish their mission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Courts generally give full faith and credit to police officers for they
are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner (Rule 131,
Section 5(m), Rules of Court; People v. <span class="SpellE">Lamong</span>, et
al., G.R. No. 82373 April 17, 1989; People v. <span class="SpellE">Gamayon</span>,
121 SCRA 642; People v. <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> 158 SCRA 85;
People v. <span class="SpellE">Patog</span>, G.R. No. 69620, September 24, 1989;
People v. <span class="SpellE">Natipravat</span>, supra; People v. de Jesus,
supra).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, their testimonies
cannot be discredited where no motive is shown why they would frame up the
appellant (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ranola</span>, April 12, 1989, No.
71752; People v. Line, 71 SCRA 249 [1976]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Well-settled is the rule that findings of the trial court on the
issue of credibility of the witnesses' testimonies are accorded great weight
and respect on appeal because the trial judge has first hand opportunity to
examine and observe the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses during the giving
of their testimonies (People v. Rodriguez, G.R. No. 81332, April 25, 1989;
People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, supra; People v. <span class="SpellE">Abonada</span>, G.R. No. 50041, January 27, 1989; People v. <span class="SpellE">Turla</span>, G.R. No. 70270, November 11, 1988; People v. <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, 147 SCRA 404 [1987]).</p>
