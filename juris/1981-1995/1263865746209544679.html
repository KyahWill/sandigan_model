as affirmed by the appellate court on August 28, 1979, directing the amicable
partition of two parcels of land between Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>
(private respondent) and her aunt Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>
(petitioner), as well as the Resolution, dated October 5, 1979, denying
petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The affirmed decision of the lower court, rendered on <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1975</st1:date>, disposes as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(a) That Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> and Cristina
<span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> are the only surviving co-heirs and co-owners
and entitled in equal shares over the parcel of land in litigation and
described under paragraph 3 of the complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) That the alleged deeds of <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>
executed by Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> covering and affecting the
two parcels of land in suit are declared null and void in so far (sic) as they
affect and/or cover the one-half undivided share and inheritance of plaintiff
Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c) Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> is ordered to account
and/or pay the value corresponding to the one-half (1/2) undivided shares of
Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> in the yearly fruits of the land and
to commence from the filing of this complaint; that is seventy five bundles of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> valued at P375.00 with legal interest fully paid;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d) That the parties are hereby ordered within (15) days from
receipt of this decision to amicably agree upon a written partition and to
submit the same for approval, parties shall appoint a Commissioner to effect
and carry out effectively the partition of the 2 parcels of land in equal parts
between the plaintiff and the defendant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(e) Defendant and her hirelings and representatives are forever
ordered to refrain from molesting the Commissioner in the discharge of his duty
to partition said two (2) parcels of land in suit;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(f) And, Defendant to pay Attorney's fee and the cost of this
suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (pp. 40-41, Record on Appeal)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-defendant Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>
appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision; hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case dwells on ownership rights over the
litigated parcels of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">As established by the trial court, <span class="SpellE">Sps</span>.
Juan <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Bidaya</span> were the original co-owners of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">two </span>parcels of land described as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cornland</span> in <span class="SpellE">Palao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, bounded on the North - Hill, on the East - <span class="SpellE">Brono</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>, on the South - <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> Palos, and on the West - <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baldozan</span>, of about 8,721 sq. m., assessed at P400.00
under Tax Dec. No. 7764;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Riceland in <span class="SpellE">Palao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, bounded on the

and West--<span class="SpellE">Telesporo</span>, about 1,539 sq. m., assessed at
P60.00, under Tax Dec. No. 7765;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (p. 10, Record on
Appeal)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The spouses died intestate and were
survived by three children - <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>, Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> and
Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> died when he was a little boy
and without any issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> died intestate,
survived by her only daughter, Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cristina claims that upon the death of her grandparents, <span class="SpellE">Sps</span>. Juan and <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>, her
mother <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> and her aunt, Maria, became
co-owners or co­-heirs of the litigated parcels of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the death of her mother, <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>, Cristina became co-heirs with Maria, having
inherited the share and interest of her mother corresponding to one-half of the
two parcels of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cristina instituted this action for partition, because her aunt,
Maria, refused to share with her the yearly fruits of the disputed parcels of
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria, however, maintains that
"she acquired these two parcels of land in 1925 (<span class="SpellE">cornland</span>)
and 1926 (<span class="SpellE">riceland</span>) from the deceased spouses Placida
<span class="SpellE">Bidaya</span> and Margarita Bose and since then until the
present, had been in open, public, peaceful, continuous, adverse possession and
enjoyment and in the concept of absolute owner thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria further claims that Cristina, her
niece, never shared or contributed to the payment of taxes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>said two parcels of land; and,
finally, that Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> was presumed already
dead" (p. 35, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">In ruling Maria and Cristina to be co-heirs, the trial court
relied on a provision separately stated in three deeds of sale executed by
Maria as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"That
I </span>am the sole and absolute owner over the above described <span class="SpellE">cornland</span> <u>having</u> <u>acquired</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u>
<u>by</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">inheritance</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> <u>from</u> <u>my</u></span> <u>late</u> father Juan <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>;" (See Exhibits '4,' '5,' '6,' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and '7,' or Exhibits 'A-1,' 'B-1,</span>' '<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">C-1,' and 'D-1;' " (p. 37, Record on
Appeal, emphasis ours)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court stated that the provision was in the nature of a
trust provision in favor of Cristina as a co-owner/co-heir.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By admitting
that the <span class="SpellE">cornland</span> is inherited property, Maria, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">effect, </span>recognized Cristina's rights
thereto as a co-heir/co-owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
trial court theorized:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">“(6)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That </span><span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> <u>never</u>
<u>partitioned</u> <u>even</u> <u>orally</u> the two parcels of lands which
were then owned in common <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">by them;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(7)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That even after the
death of <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>,
the land in suit <u>remained</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>undivided</u>
and were therefore in the possession of Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>
because her niece Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> went to Manila and
now married and presently residing at No. 22, 11th Avenue, Grace Park, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(8)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That without the
knowledge and consent of Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> who was
then of legal age, her aunt Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> executed on
April 27, 1973 a Deed of absolute Sale (Exhibit 'A') in favor of Marina Pizarro
who acquired portion No. 3 of the <span class="SpellE">cornland</span>; on the
same date she also executed another Deed of Sale (Exhibit 'B') in favor of <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacopia</span>, who acquired
portion No. 2 of the <span class="SpellE">cornland</span>; and, on June 16, 1965
again Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> executed a third Deed of Sale
(Exhibit 'C') in favor of <span class="SpellE">Casimira</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacopia</span>, who acquired portion No. 1 of the <span class="SpellE">cornland</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(9)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That these three (3)
separated (sic) Deeds of Sale all executed by Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>
over the <span class="SpellE">cornland</span> have a respective total area of 740
square meters, more or less, for portion No. 3; 1,836 square meters, more or
less for portion No. 2; and 1,265 square meters, more or less for portion No.
1, or a total area of 3,481 square meters more or less;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(10) That in these three separate Deeds of Sale, Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span> expressly provided the aforesaid trust
provision." (pp. 36-37, Record on Appeal, emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Despite admission during the hearing on the identity of the lands
in question (see p. 21, Record on Appeal), Maria's counsel, on appeal,
re-emphasized her original claim that the two parcels of land in her possession
were acquired from the <span class="SpellE">Sps</span>. <span class="SpellE">Placido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Biduya</span> and Margarita Bose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the private document relative to the
purchase, was not produced at the trial, allegedly because "they were
placed in a trunk in their house which were burned during the Japanese
Occupation." In 1945, Maria sold the <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No written evidence was submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For all legal intents therefore, the <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> remained inherited property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The identity of the <span class="SpellE">cornland</span>
as inherited property can no longer be disputed, in view of Maria's admission
in the deeds of sale she had executed, containing the trust provisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having established Cristina's co-ownership rights, Maria
nonetheless insists that Cristina's rights are barred by prescription under <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 40 and 41 of Act 190 (Code of Civil Procedure,
Article 1116, Civil Code) then the applicable law, where the longest period of
both acquisitive and extinctive prescription was only ten years (Diaz v. <span class="SpellE">Garricho</span>, 103 Phil. 261, 266). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In the present case, Cristina, it is alleged,
asserted her claims 34 years after her right of action accrued, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></span> After Cristina left barrio <span class="SpellE">Palao</span> at the age of eleven (11), she never returned until
she was twenty two (22) years old and married (pp. 32-34, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
Nov. 4, 1974).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon her return her
grandmother <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Bidaya</span>
was already dead (p. 33, id).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that
time, Cristina claimed her hereditary share in the lands in question but her
demands were ignored and repudiated by her aunt Maria, Cristina admitted that
ever since the Japanese occupation when she was already of age, her aunt Maria
refused to recognize her rights to said lands (pp. 41-42, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From that moment when Maria ignored and
repudiated Cristina's hereditary rights, Cristina's right of action already
accrued and the period of prescription began to run.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The instant action was filed only in 1974 (p. 1, Record on
Appeal), or some 34 years after it accrued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If she had any rights at all, Cristina slept on her rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The present action is unquestionably barred
by prescription." (pp. 27-28, Appellants' Brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Against Maria's claims of acquisitive prescription, the lower
court ruled that Maria was a trustee with respect to Cristina's share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">As </span>such,
prescription, as a mode of acquiring title, could not apply:</p>

<blockquote>"A co-owner is a trustee for the other co-owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No one of the co-owners may acquire exclusive
ownership of the common property thru prescription for possession by one
trustee alone is not deemed adverse to the rest (<span class="SpellE">Castrillo</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, 10 SCRA 549; <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>, 9 SCRA 841 and, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>, 20 SCRA 219)." (p. 6, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While We agree with the trial court that Maria and Cristina are co-heirs,
and that with respect to them prescription, as a mode of acquisition, cannot
apply, We hasten to elaborate on certain aspects, which need clarification.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is correct to say that possession by one co-owner (trustee) is
not deemed adverse to the others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this sense, an action to compel partition will lie at any time and does not
prescribe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, not legally
correct to say that by virtue of the <span class="SpellE">imprescriptibility</span>
of an action for partition, prescription as a mode of acquiring title, can
never be invoked, or in the present case, that Maria, as a co-owner can never
acquire the property by prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">An action for partition implies that the thing is still owned in
common.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If a co-owner or co-heir holds
the property in exclusive adverse possession as owner, asserting sole and
exclusive dominion for the required period, he can acquire sole title to it as
against the co-heirs or co-owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>imprescriptibility</u></span> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>action</u>
<u>for</u> <u>partition</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>thus</u> <u>be</u> <u>invoked</u> <u>when</u>
<u>one</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>co-owners</u> <u>has</u> <u>possessed</u> <u>the</u>
<u>property</u> <u>as</u> <u>exclusive</u> <u>owner,</u> <u>and</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u>
<u>period</u> <u>sufficient</u> <u>to</u> <u>acquire</u> <u>it</u> <u>by</u> <u>prescription</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the moment one of the co-owners claims
that he is the absolute and exclusive owner of the properties and denies the
others any share therein, the question involved is no longer one of partition, <u>but</u>
<u>of</u> <u>ownership</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(A. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Civil Code of the Phil., Ann., Vol. II, pp.
192-193; <span class="SpellE">Bargayo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Comumot</span>,
40 Phil. 856, at p. 870).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this sense,
the trial court erred in saying that there can be no prescription (as a mode of
acquiring title) in favor of a co-owner/trustee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having clarified this issue, the main question to be resolved is
whether or not Maria has been in possession of the lands in question <u>under</u>
<u>the</u> <u>conditions</u> <u>required</u> by Section 41 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, as to uphold acquisitive prescription in her favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the conditions imposed by said section is that the
possession must be adverse against the whole world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order that a possession may be deemed
adverse to the <span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>que</u></span>
trust, or the other co-owner the following must concur:</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></span> (1) that he has performed unequivocal acts
of repudiation amounting to an ouster of the <span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>que</u></span> <u>trust</u> or other co-owner, (2) that
such positive acts of repudiation have been made known to the <span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>que</u></span> <u>trust</u>
or other co-owners, and (3) that the evidence thereon must be clear and
convincing." (A. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Civil Code of the <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>., Ann., Vol. II, p. 193)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, Maria <span class="SpellE">Bicarme</span>
disclaims the co-ownership by denying that subject properties are the inherited
properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other than the tax
declarations in her name, there is no written evidence that these were
acquired/purchased from <span class="SpellE">Sps</span>. <span class="SpellE">Placido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Biduya</span> and Margarita Bose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Payment of land taxes does not constitute
sufficient repudiation of the co-ownership, as it is not an act adverse to
Cristina's rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Cristina,
being a minor, until she claimed her rights, was not even aware thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did Maria make known her repudiation
to Cristina, because all along, Maria presumed her to be dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her refusal to share with Cristina the yearly
profits stemmed from Cristina's failure to share in the yearly taxes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acquisitive prescription cannot therefore
apply in this case:</p>

<blockquote>"Acts which are adverse to strangers may not be sufficiently
adverse to the co-owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A mere silent
possession by a co-owner, his receipt of rents, fruits or profits from the
property, the erection of buildings and fences and the planting of trees
thereon, and the payment of land taxes, cannot serve as proof of exclusive
ownership, if it is not borne out by clear, complete and conclusive evidence
that he exercised acts of possession which unequivocally constituted an ouster
or deprivation of the rights <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>the
other co-owners." (<span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ilan</span>, 28 O.G. 62; Laguna v. <span class="SpellE">Levantino</span>,
40 O.G. (14th <span class="SpellE">Suppl</span>.) 136, cited in A. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Civil Code of the Philippines, Ann., Vol. II,
pp. 193-194)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">follows </span>that
neither can the doctrine on <span class="SpellE">laches</span> apply, for absent
acquisitive prescription, (i.e., where it has <u>not</u> been shown that the
possession of the claimant has been adverse and exclusive and opposed to the
right of the others) the case is not one of ownership, in which case, the
doctrine on <span class="SpellE">imprescriptibility</span> of an action for
partition will apply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cristina's right
to partition will therefore prosper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, We eliminate the award on attorney's fees in the absence
of any specific allegation thereon in her complaint, or that the same is
covered by any of the eleven (11) exceptions enumerated in Art. 2208 of the New
Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if We were to concede
exerci<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">s</span>e of judicial discretion
in the award of attorney's fees under Art. 2208, par. 11, this provision
"demands a factual, legal or equitable justification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without such justification, the award is a
conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation
and conjecture." (<span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> v. De la Cruz, G.R.
L-32552, July 31, 1978; 84 SCRA 337.) Likewise, "the matter of attorney's
fees cannot be touched once and only in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The text itself
must expressly state the reason why attorney's fees are being awarded" (<u>ibid</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the matter of such fees
was touched but once and appears only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition for review is DENIED and the

the modification that the award on attorney's fees is eliminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
