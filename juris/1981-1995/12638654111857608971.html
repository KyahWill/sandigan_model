"Agrarian reform," according to SEC. 3 of RA 6657, "means redistribution
of lands, regardless of crops or fruits produced, to farmers and regular
farmworkers who are landless, irrespective of tenurial arrangement, to include
the totality of factors and support services designed to lift the economic
status of the beneficiaries and all other arrangements alternative to physical
redistribution of lands, such as production or profit-sharing, labor
administration, and the distribution of shares of stock, which will allow
beneficiaries to receive a just share of the fruits of the lands they
work." "Agrarian dispute," in the context of the DAR's power to
"hear and decide all cases, disputes or controversies" set out in the
second paragraph of SEC. 50, "refers," according to the same SEC. 3, "to
any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy,
stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes
concerning farmworkers' associations or representation of persons in
negotiating, fixing, maintaining changing or seeking to arrange terms or
conditions of such tenurial arrangements.," including "any
controversy relating to compensation of lands acquired under ** (the) Act and
other terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to
farm-workers tenants and other agrarian reform beneficiaries, whether the
disputants stand in the proximate relation of farm operator and beneficiary,
landowner and tenant, or lessor and lessee."</p>
