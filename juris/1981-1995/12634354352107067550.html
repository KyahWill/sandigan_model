				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Defendant-appellant Roberto Oliquino alias "Berto" was
convicted of the crime of rape by the RTC of Calauag, Quezon, Branch 63 and
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion perpetua</u> and to indemnify
the complainant in the amount of P30,000.00.  Now seeking a reversal of the decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> of the
trial court, appellant claims that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt
beyond reasonable <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">doubt
because his conviction was based merely on presumptions and that the testimony
of the complainant is not credible because the same was made after the
complainant had the opportunity to think and reflect, the alleged rape being
reported to the authorities three (3) months after it supposedly occurred.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Complainant Eden Argudo was at the time of the incident a twenty
(20) year old second year college student of the Polytechnic University of the
Philippines in Lopez, Quezon.  She was
living with her parents in Barangay Inalusan, Lopez, Quezon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Oliquino was the "compadre" of the
complainant's mother, Tarciana Argudo.  Appellant's ability as an "herbolario" or faith healer was
well known in their <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">place and
he had previously treated Eden for various ailments when she was younger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In May 1988, Eden complained of intense stomach pain.  She was brought by her mother, Tarciana
Argudo, to appellant Oliquino for treatment at the latter's house situated near
a mountain at Barangay Rosario in Lopez, Quezon.  Appellant gave Eden a prescription for her stomach pain and
instructed her to return for regular treatment every Tuesday and Friday.  Accompanied by her mother, Eden returned to
appellant's place for treatment regularly as instructed until 5 August 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 5 August 1988 at about 12:30 o'clock in the afternoon, Eden
and her mother arrived at appellant's house.  He and his young children were the only persons inside the house.  Appellant had no other patients when Eden
and her mother arrived at his residence; neither were there other patients during
the time Eden was being treated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before proceeding with Eden's treatment, appellant informed
Tarciana that he would treat Eden at the foot of the mountain at the back of
his house.  He instructed Tarciana to
stay inside the house to pray and to continue doing so until they were
back.  Tarciana complied with
appellant's instruction and started to pray.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Taking a candle and his medals with him, appellant took Eden to the foot of the
mountain at the back of his house.  The
grass and coconut trees concealed them from the view of those who were inside
the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant then ordered Eden to sit under one of the coconut
trees.  When she was seated, appellant
started touching Eden's breasts and embraced her.  Eden tried to resist but appellant poked a knife or
"itak-itakan" at her neck, told her not to try to escape and to
follow what she was instructed to do.  Then, appellant ordered Eden to stand up.  Stricken with fear, Eden complied with her eyes closed and
resigned herself to her fate.  With the
knife still pointed at Eden's neck, the latter was not able to stop appellant
from removing her "maong" pants and panty.  Overwhelming fear caused by the threat on her life outweighed
Eden's instinctive desire to struggle and resist appellant's lustful
intentions.  Thus appellant succeeded in
separating Eden's legs, placed himself on top of her and had carnal knowledge
of her against her will.</p>

<p class="BODY">After satisfying his lust, appellant ordered Eden to dress up and
threatened her not to report the incident to <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">anyone, otherwise, he would kill her and her parents by putting
a curse or "kulam" upon them.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When appellant and Eden returned to the house after being out for
about an hour, Tarciana noticed that her daughter was crying.  When she asked Eden why she was crying, appellant
admonished Tarciana not to ask questions and to refrain from doing so even
after they have reached their house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since her last visit for treatment at appellant's house on 5
August 1988, Eden's family noticed some strange changes in her behavior.  She was always depressed and crying; and as
a result, she became thinner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Despite her mother's insistence, Eden refused to go back to appellant's house
for further treatment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Worried about her daughter's condition, in September 1988,
Tarciana fetched appellant Oliquino to treat Eden at their own house, since
Eden refused to go back to the appellant's place.  Upon seeing appellant, Eden became hysterical and she started
shouting and crying.  The second time
appellant was summoned to treat Eden in October 1988, Eden once more became
hysterical.  She began crying and <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">shouted that she did not want
appellant to come near her.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In November 1988, Eden's parents became extremely worried about
her condition when she started vomiting.  When Eden was asked by her parents as to what was wrong with her, she
revealed to them that she was raped by appellant during her last visit for
treatment on 5 August 1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 November 1988, Eden was brought by her parents to the
Magsaysay Memorial Hospital for medical examination.  Dr. Romeo Tapales, the examining doctor, made a diagnosis that
Eden's hymen was lacerated at 3:00 o'clock and the pregnancy test confirmed
that she was pregnant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> After
said examination, Eden and her parents proceeded to the police station in
Lopez, Quezon to file a criminal complaint for rape against the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an information dated 7 February 1989,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

appellant Roberto "Berto" Oliquino was charged with the crime of rape
before the RTC of Calauag, Quezon, Branch 63, docketed as Criminal Case No.
89-1577-C.  The information reads as
follows?</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about 5th day of August 1988, at Barangay Rosario,
Municipality of Lopez, Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court.  The above-named accused, with lewd design, armed with a knife, by means
of force, violence, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of said Eden V. Argudo,
against her will.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment on 5 July 1989, appellant entered a plea of
not guilty.  For his defense, appellant
denied the charge against him, alleging that it was impossible for him to have
raped Eden at the back of his house because there were other houses near his
house and that several patients were present when he treated Eden inside his
house on 5 August 1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant presented as one of his witnesses, Rosario de los
Reyes, who testified that she was a neighbor of appellant and that the latter's
house was surrounded by several houses; that there were several patients inside
the house of appellant including herself and her son, when Eden <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">was treated by petitioner.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

he was one of the patients present when Eden was treated by appellant inside
the latter's house.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the pendency of the case, Eden had a miscar­riage.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
After the case was heard, the trial court found appellant guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in its decision dated 20 June 1990, the
dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused
ROBERTO OLIQUINO alias "Berto" guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of rape committed with the use of a deadly weapon and hereby sentences
him to suffer the single indivi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">sible penalty of <u>reclusion perpetua</u>
with its accessory penalties and to indemnify the offended party EDEN V. ARGUDO
in the amount of thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00) as moral and actual damages
and attorney's fees with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the crime of rape is
committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under the following
circumstances:  by using force or
intimidation; when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or
when the woman is under twelve (12) years of age, even though neither of the
two (2) aforementioned circumstances are present.</p>

<p class="BODY">In most cases, the crime of rape is committed without any
witnesses other than the victim and the culprit.  Because of the intrinsic nature of the crime, the conviction or
acquittal of the accused depends almost entirely on the credibility of the
complainant's testimony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> The
evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot
be allowed to draw its strength from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">weakness of the evidence of the accused.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The delay in filing the complaint three (3) months after the
incident occurred does not automatically render Eden's testimony as
incredible.  Eden's fear caused by the threat
made by appellant that he would kill her and her parents by putting a curse or
"kulam" upon them, if she would tell anyone that she was raped by
him, prevented her from immediately reporting the incident to her family and
the authorities.  While a threat of a
curse or "kulam" may be shrugged off by some individuals who will
consider the same as unbelievable or a farce, however, for a young and
unsophisticated lass like Eden, it is not inconceivable that she took such
threat seriously.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eden had been treated by appellant for various ailments since she
was a young girl and had known him as her mother's "compadre." Her
whole family had trusted appellant.  The
latter's act of raping Eden caused her emotional distress, for which reason,
she suffered depression and became hysterical whenever she saw the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also quite apparent that Eden's fear that appellant would
kill her and her parents if she would report the incident to anyone and her
troubled state of mind were the reasons for the delay in reporting the incident
to the authorities and in the filing of the charge against appellant.  There was a valid cause for the delay in
filing the complaint.  Delay in the
filing of said complaint alone is not sufficient to destroy the veracity of the
testimony of the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully going over the records of the case, we find the
testimony of Eden as credible, logical and consistent.  There is no doubt in our mind that appellant
had carnal knowledge of her against her will and with the use of force and
intimidation.  For, as oft-repeated, no
young Filipina would publicly admit that she had been criminally ravished
unless that is the truth and her natural instinct is to protect her honor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
As observed by the trial court, although Eden was crying and trembling while
testifying on the witness stand, Eden was sincere and truthful in her narration
of events that occurred on 5 August 1988.  We find no reason to overthrow the trial court's finding as to the
credibility of the complainant.  The
trial court's decision was based on the evidence presented before it and not
based merely on presumptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant claims that Eden's ulterior motive in filing the charge
for rape against him was to protect her boyfriend who, according to appellant,
was the one who actually impregnated her.  However, appellant not only failed to present evidence to substantiate
the alleged ulterior motive on the part of the complainant, but we find his
contention to be absurd.  It is
inconceivable for a young and promising college student to expose herself to
public trial for rape just to protect her boyfriend from the responsibility of
impregnating her.  An admission on her
part that she got pregnant by her boyfriend would be less traumatic than going
through a long and embarrassing trial, wherein she had to testify as to the
gory details of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise find no merit in appellant's pretense that it was
impossible for him to have raped Eden at the back of his house where his
neighbors would have witnessed the incident, because his house near the school
is surrounded by other houses.  It was,
however, established before the trial court that in July 1988, appellant sold
his house near the school.  He and his
family transferred to his new residence near the mountain where they had no
neighbors.  On 5 August 1988, Eden and
her mother went to see appellant at his <u>new</u> <u>residence</u> and not at
his old house which he had already sold.  Since appellant's house near the mountain was not surrounded by other
houses for it was quite isolated, no neighbor of his could have witnessed the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of the trial court
finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape is hereby
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">AFFIRMED.   </span>Costs against the appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
