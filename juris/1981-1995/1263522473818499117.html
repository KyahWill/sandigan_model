This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, 
now Intermediate Appellate Court, affirming a judgment of the then Court
 of First Instance of Rizal dismissing the petition for declaratory 
relief and/or reformation of instrument filed by the petitioners against
 the respondents and ordering the petitioners to pay jointly and 
severally the amounts of P200,000.00 for respondent Edna Camcam and 
P50,000.00 for respondent Littawa, as moral damages; the amount of 
P50,000.00 for both respondents as exemplary damages; the amount of 
P30,000.00 for and as attorney's fees, and to pay the costs of the suit.
<p>
On July 1, 1975, the petitioners purchased from the Estate of the 
Deceased Agapita Sarao Vda. de Virata three (3) contiguous parcels of 
land located at San Juan, Rizal, containing an aggregate area of 3,328 
square meters, more or less, for and in consideration of the amount of 
P499,200.00.
</p><p>
The following day, July 2, 1975, the petitioners, in a contract 
denominated as Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase, sold to the 
private respondents the same three contiguous parcels of land for the 
same amount of P499,200.00 under specified terms and conditions. One of 
the terms and conditions was that the repurchase price would escalate 
month after month, depending on when repurchase would be effected. The 
price would be P532,480.66 computed at P160.00 per square meter after 
the first month; P565,760.00 computed at P170.00 per square meter after 
the second month; P599,040.00 computed at P180.00 per square meter after
 the third month; and P632,320.00 computed at P190.00 per square meter 
after the fourth month, from and after the date of the instrument. It 
was also stipulated in the same contract that the vendor shall have the 
right to possess, use, and build on, the property during the period 
pending redemption.
</p><p>
On August 26, 1976, the petitioners filed a petition for declaratory 
relief and/or reformation of instrument before the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal at Pasig, Metro Manila to declare the Deed of Sale 
with Right to Repurchase an equitable mortgage and the entire portion of
 the same deed referring to the accelerating repurchase price null and 
avoid for being usurious, and to reduce the loan obligation to 
P474,200.00, contending that the amount actually loaned was only 
P474,200.00 and the petitioners put up P25,000.00 of the wife's money 
when the purchase from the estate of Mrs. Virata was consummated.
</p><p>
On August 27, 1976, the private respondents, in turn, filed a petition 
for the consolidation of ownership on the ground that "more than a year 
has elapsed since the execution of the Deed of Sale with Right to 
Repurchase by the vendor on July 2, 1975." The private respondents 
contended that "notwithstanding which the vendor has failed to avail of 
its rights under the provisions of Article 1607 in relation to Article 
1616 of the New Civil Code, the vendor has lost all his rights to avail 
himself of the right to consolidate ownership of the property subject of
 the Deed of Sale." To this petition for consolidation of ownership, the
 petitioners filed their opposition upon the following grounds: (a) 
there is a pending suit between the same parties involving the same 
cause and subject matter; (b) consolidation will be improper considering
 that the basic document upon which it is being sought is in fact and in
 law only an equitable mortgage; and (c) consolidation cannot be 
effected thru the instant petition.
</p><p>
Accordingly, the Court of First Instance of Rizal ordered the transfer 
of the petition for consolidation of ownership to Branch XXIV of the 
same Court where the petition for declaratory relief and/or reformation 
of instrument was pending in order that the two cases may be considered 
together.
</p><p>
A supplemental petition was subsequently filed by the petitioners 
alleging that the private respondents' petition for consolidation of 
ownership was made in order to frustrate and render nugatory whatever 
orders or judgment may be issued by the trial court in the petition for 
dec­laratory relief and/or reformation of instrument.
</p><p>
After the trial and presentation of the parties' respective memoranda, 
the trial court rendered the decision in favor of the private 
respondents.
</p><p>
The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals. The appellate court 
affirmed in toto the decision of the trial court. Two motions for 
reconsideration having been denied, the petitioners filed the present 
petition based on the following grounds:

DEED OF SALE WITH RIGHT TO RE­PURCHASE TO BE AN EQUITABLE MORTGAGE.
</p><p>
The issue in this case is whether or not the deed of sale with right to repurchase should be declared as an equitable mortgage.
</p><p>
We find meritorious the petitioners' contention that under Article 1602 
of the Civil Code the deed of sale with right to repurchase should be 
presumed to be an equitable mortgage due to the following reasons:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(1)    The two contracts involving the subject properties came 
one after another in the space of two (2) days. The Deed of Absolute 
Sale between petitioner Jose R. Bundalian as vendee and Romeo S. Geluz, 
in his capacity as Administrator of the Estate of the deceased Agapita 
Sarao Vda. de Virata, as vendor, was executed on July 1, 1975 (pp. 
19-26, Annex "A"). The purported Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase 
bet­ween petitioner, Jose R. Bundalian as vendor and respondents Juanito
 Littawa and Edna Camcam as vendees was executed on July 2, 1975 (pp. 
26-32, Annex "A"). This already indicates, at a very early stage, that 
the two transactions must be intimately related. </p>
  <p> "(2)    Such intimate relation between the aforementioned Deed of 
Absolute Sale and Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase is already clear
 in the statement in the latter instrument that the subject property had
 just been purchased by Jose R. Bundalian from the estate of the 
deceased Agapita Sarao Vda. de Virata, 'with funds loaned to him by the 
herein VENDEES' the latter being no other than respondents Littawa and 
Camcam (p. 28, Annex "A"). Patently, peti­tioner Jose R. Bundalian was 
funded by private respondents to enable him to purchase the pro­perty 
from the said estate. </p>
  <p> "(3)    Having just purchased the property from the estate by way 
of Deed of Absolute Sale on July 1, 1975, for which he had just paid 
P499,200.00 as purchase price, it would have been utterly senseless for 
petitioner Jose R. Bundalian to sell the same property to private 
respondents the very next day, July 2, 1975, with or without the right 
of repurchase. No other conclusion is possible except that the Deed of 
Sale with Right to Repurchase is precisely the security - the equitable 
mortgage - to petitioner Jose R. Bundalian to enable the latter to 
purchase the property from the aforementioned estate. </p>
  <p> "(4)    It would have been more senseless for petitioner Jose R. 
Bundalian to sell the property to private respondents at the same price 
of P499,200.00 he had paid the estate of the deceased Agapita Sarao Vda.
 de Virata, without profit and at a sure loss. By the terms of the Deed 
of Sale with Right to Repurchase he would have to repurchase the 
property at a continually increasing price, from P150.00 per square 
meter to P190.00 per square meter, that is, up to P133,120.00 over and 
above the original price of P499,200.00, in only four (4) months. Again,
 no other conclusion is possible but that the contract is an equitable 
mortgage, not a sale. </p>
  <p> "(5)    It is provided in the Deed of Sale with Right to 
Repurchase that 'It is agreed that the vendor (Jose R. Bundalian) shall 
have the right to possess, use, and build on, the property during the 
period of redemption' (p. 30, Annex "A"). It has been held that there is
 a 'loan with security' rather than a pacto de retro sale where by 
agreement the vendor was to remain in possession of the lands (Escoto 
vs. Arcilla, 89 Phil. 199, 204). Where there was an acknowledgment of 
the vendor's right to retain possession of the property, as in the case 
at bar, the contract was one of 'loan guaranteed by a mortgage' rather 
than a conditional sale (Macoy vs. Trinidad, 95 Phil. 192, 202). Indeed,
 there can be no question that petitioner Jose R. Bundalian remained 
legally in possession of the subject property. Again, the conclusion is 
ineluctable that the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase was executed 
as security for the loan extended by private respondents to petitioner 
Jose R. Bundalian, i.e., as equitable mortgage. </p>
  <p> "(6)    The increase <em>per month</em> in the alleged redemption 
price is very compatible with the idea that the transaction was really 
intended by the parties to be a mortgage. It bears emphasis, at this 
juncture, that the supposed repurchase price is <em>in the same amount</em> as the original 'price' of P499,200.00 should 'repurchase' be effected during the <em>first month</em>
 from and after the date of the instrument; P532,480.00 computed at 
P160.00 per square meter should 'repurchase' be effected after the first
 month; P565,760.00 computed at P170.00 per square meter should 
'repurchase' be after the second month; P599,040.00 computed at P180.00 
per square meter should 'repurchase' be after the third month; or 
P632,320.00 computed at P190.00 per square meter should 'repurchase' be 
effected even 'after the fourth month (pp. 29-30, Annex "A"). The 
monthly increases in the alleged 'redemption price' clearly represent 
nothing but interest. It is well-settled that provision for interest 
payments is a clear indication that the supposed sale is actually an 
equitable mortgage (Macoy vs. Trinidad, 95 Phil. 192, 202; Escoto vs. 
Arcilla, 89 Phil. 199, 204). This would fall under the legal situation 
'where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties 
is that the transaction shall secure the payment of a debt or the 
performance of any other obli­gation' (No. 6), Art. 1602, Civil Code). 
To make matters worse, <em>the monthly increase in the supposed 'redemption price</em>',
 meaning the interest of course, are clearly usurious, precisely one of 
the evils sought to be negated by the provisions of Articles 1602, 1603 
and 1604 of the Civil Code, as noted previously herein. </p>
  <p> "(7)    While the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase supposedly
 provided for a 'redemption' period of 'four (4) months from and after 
the date of this instrument' (p. 29, Annex "A"), it later necessarily 
provided for a built-in extension of the period of 'redemption' by 
providing for payment of the amount of P632,320.00 computed at P190.00 
per square meter should 'repurchase' be effected <em>'after' the fourth month</em>
 (p. 30, Annex "A"). In other words, it was implicitly agreed that the 
period of 'repurchase' was not limited to 4 months from and after the 
date of execution of the instrument, in as much as said 'repurchase' 
could be effected even 'after' the fourth month. It is well-settled that
 extension of the period of 'redemption' is indicative of equitable 
mortgage (Nos. (3) and (6), Art. 1602, Civil Code; Reyes vs. De Leon, 20
 SCRA 369, 370). </p>
  <p> "(8)    It may be argued, as private respondents have argued, that
 normally a loan does not exceed 60% of the price of the land given as 
security, so that private respondents could not have loaned P499,200.00 
on the land the value of which was claimed to be also P499,200.00. 
However, such reasoning is clearly unsound. It loses sight of the fact 
that private respondents precisely funded or financed petitioner Jose R.
 Bundalian's acquisition of the property from the estate of the deceased
 Agapita Sarao Vda. de Virata. In other words, petitioner Jose R. 
Bundalian could not have acquired the land to serve as security for the 
repayment of the loan unless private res­pondents had extended the loan 
in the first place. Surely, private respondents stood to benefit 
enormously from such financing transaction in view of the patently 
usurious monthly interests transparently disguised as the accelerating 
or increasing monthly 'repurchase' price. At any rate, in the event that
 petitioner Jose R. Bundalian ultimately failed to pay the loan, the 
rapid increase in the price of the land, which was estimated to be worth
 at least P632,320.00 after 4 months (from the initial P499,200.00), 
practically guaranteed a very good return on the money investment of 
private respondents as money-lenders. </p>
  <p> "(9)    It cannot be questioned that petitioner Jose R. Bundalian <em>paid taxes</em>
 on the land, even after the supposed 4-month period of 'redemption'. 
Payment of taxes after expiration of the supposed 'redemption' period 
has been considered as indicative of equitable mortgage (Escoto vs. 
Arcilla, supra). </p>
  <p> "(10)  It is an admitted fact that private respondents took some 
time before filing their petition for consolidation of ownership. 
Private respondents admitted in said petition that 'more than a year has
 elapsed since the execution of the Deed of Sale with Right to 
Repurchase' (p. 34, par. 3, Annex "A"). Reckoning 4 months from July 2, 
1975, it would appear that the 'repurchase' period expired supposedly on
 November 2, 1975. As private respondents filed their petition for 
con­solidation on August 27, 1976, it is clear that they <em>delayed</em> filing said petition by <em>more than 9 months</em>.
 A similar delay in the filing of the supposed 'vendee's' petition for 
consolidation was considered as indicative of equitable mortgage (Reyes 
vs. de Leon, 20 SCRA 369, 378). </p>
  <p> "(11)  If the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase would not be 
considered as an equitable mortgage, it would result that there was 
actually <em>no security for the loan</em> of P499,200.00 extended by private respondents to petitioners Jose R. Bundalian, <em>which would make no sense at all</em>,
 considering the enormity of the loan. There was, to be sure, a security
 for said loan, none other than the equitable mortgage tainted with 
usury and disguised as the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The private respondents argued that the petitioners' contention is true 
only in cases where the contract or instrument is not reflective of the 
true intentions of the contracting parties as would warrant reformation 
of the same. They stated that if the intention of the parties is to 
execute a deed of sale with pacto de retro, the contract should be held 
as such. The petitioners were allegedly fully aware that the deed of 
sale with pacto de retro is what it purports to be and nothing else. 
Furthermore, the petitioners waited for the period of redemption to 
expire before availing of the relief granted by the Civil Code of 
reformation of contracts.
</p><p>
We find the stand of the private respondents without merit. The intent 
of the parties to circumvent the pro­vision discouraging pacto de retro 
transactions is very apparent from the records. Article 1602 of the 
Civil Code states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Article 1602. The contract shall be presumed to be an equitable mortgage, in any of the following cases: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "(1)    When the price of a sale with right to repurchase is unusually inadequate; </p>
    <p> "(2)    When the vendor remains in pos­session as lessee or otherwise; </p>
    <p> "(3)    When upon or after the expiration of the right to 
repurchase another instrument extending the period of redemption or 
granting a new period is executed; </p>
    <p> "(4)    When the purchaser retains for himself a part of the purchase price; </p>
    <p> "(5)    When the vendor binds himself to pay the taxes on the thing sold; </p>
    <p> "(6)    In any other cases where it may be fairly inferred that 
the real intention of the parties is that the transaction shall secure 
the payment of a debt or performance of any other obligation. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "In any of the foregoing cases, any money, fruits, or other 
benefit to be received by the vendee as rent or otherwise shall be 
considered as interest which shall be subject to the usury laws."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Significantly, a portion of the document in question reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(The vendor) having just purchased the same from the Intestate 
estate of the deceased Agapita Sarao Vda. de Virata (Special Proceedings
 No. N-710) of the Court of First Instance of Cavite), <em>with funds loaned to him </em>by the herein VENDEES." (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This statement appearing in the supposed pacto de retro sale confirms 
the real intention of the parties to secure the payment of the loan 
acquired by the petitioners from the private respondents. The sale with 
the right to repurchase of the three parcels of land was for 
P499,200.00, which was exactly the same amount paid to the estate of the
 deceased Agapita Sarao Vda. de Virata. After having purchased the three
 lots for P499,200.00, the vendors should at least have earned a little 
profit or interest if they really intended to resell the lots the 
following day. Instead, they suffered a loss of P25,000.00 because the 
amount borrowed, and we find grounds to believe their statement of 
having advanced P25,000.00 of their own funds as earnest money, was 
actually only P474,000.00. The petitioners also bound themselves to pay 
exceedingly stiff prices for the privilege of repurchase. The intent of 
the parties is further shown by the fact that the Bundalians P500,000.00
 collectibles due from the government for completed construction 
contracts could not be collected on time to pay for the lots advertised 
for sale in <em>Bulletin Today.</em> The petitioners had to run to the 
private respondents who had money to lend. The Bundalians received the 
accounts due from the government only in 1977 after the proceedings in 
the trial court were well underway.
</p><p>
The stipulation in the contract sharply escalating the repurchase price 
every month enhances the presumption that the transaction is an 
equitable mortgage. Its purpose is to secure the return of the money 
invested with substantial profit or interest, a common characteristic of
 loans.
</p><p>
The private respondents try to capitalize on an admission by Mrs. 
Bundalian that she "accepted" the transac­tion knowing it to be a 
contract of sale with right of re­purchase. The reliance is grounded on 
shaky foundations. The Bundalians were in the construction business and 
knew quite well what they were signing. But vendors covered by Article 
1602 of the Civil Code are usually in no position to bargain with the 
vendees and will sign onerous contracts to get the money they need. It 
is precisely this evil which the Civil Code guards against. It is not 
the knowledge of the vendors that they are executing a contract of sale 
pacto de retro which is the issue but whether or not the real contract 
was one of sale or a loan disguised as a pacto de retro sale.
</p><p>
The contract also provides that "it is agreed that the vendor shall have
 the right to possess, use, and build on, the property during the period
 of redemption". When the vendee acknowledged the right of the vendor to
 retain possession of the property the contract is one of loan 
guaranteed by mortgage, not a conditional sale or an option to 
repurchase. (Macoy vs. Trinidad, et al., 95 Phil. 192).
</p><p>
The respondents' contention that the right to possess, use, or build on 
the lots embodied in the contract was a mere "right" and not actual 
possession appears to be sophistry. The records show that the Bundalians
 construction equipment such as tractors, payloaders, and bulldozers 
were on the lots. A shop was built on the premises. Mr. Bundalian 
testified that from the time he purchased the property from the estate 
of Mrs. Virata up to the "minute" he testified, he never lost 
possession. The Bundalians paid the real estate taxes on the lots. As 
against the express provision of the contract and the actual possession 
by the petitioners, the private respondents come up with a far fetched 
argument that since the titles to the lots were in their hands, they 
were the ones in legal possession. Parenthetically, the titles in their 
hands were still in the name of the estate of Agapita Sarao Vda. de 
Virata, the original vendor-owner.
</p><p>
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decisions of the respondent Court of 
Appeals and the trial court are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The deed 
of sale with right to repurchase is declared as an equitable mortgage. 
The petitioners are ordered to pay their debt to the private respondents
 with legal rate of interest from the time they acquired the loan until 
it is fully paid.
SO ORDERED.
