of the Director of Bureau of Labor Relations ordering the holding of a
certification election among the workers of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
Fruits Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">are </span>as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Associated Labor Unions, ALU for brevity, had a
collective bargaining agreement with the employer <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
Fruits Corporation <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">whic</span>h<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>expired on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the said date, or on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1987</st1:date>, petitioner and the
employer signed a collective bargaining agreement which was to take effect on <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1987</st1:date> and <span class="GramE">was</span> to remain so until <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>said collective
bargaining agreement was unanimously approved and ratified by the members of
the bargaining unit.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10,
 1987</st1:date>, private respondent National Federation of Labor (NFL<span class="GramE">),</span> filed a petition for certification election questioning
the majority status of the incumbent union, pursuant to Executive Order 111 and
its Implementing Rules, there being more than majority of its members who have
expressed doubts on the sincerity of the incumbent union.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Acting on the said petition the Med-Arbiter scheduled a hearing on August 21,
1987 to determine the majority status of herein petitioner but the NFL
representative failed to appear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">despite </span>due
notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the hearing was
reset to <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1987</st1:date>
to give NFL an opportunity to substantiate its claim but again, the NFL was not
<span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">represented</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter,
the parties were asked to submit their position papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To bolster its claim, ALU submitted several
petitions signed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">members of </span>the
bargaining unit to dismiss any petition filed by any union which seeks to
question the majority status of the incumbent union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The signatories to the petition also
reaffirmed its loyalty to ALU.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1987</st1:date>,
the Med-Arbiter promulgated an Order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing the petition for certification election on the ground of failure to
prosecute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An appeal to the Bureau of
Labor Relations however, proved fruitful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1987</st1:date>
the respondent Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations held that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Med-Arbiter erred in dismissing </span>the
petition for certification election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">decision </span>reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>'"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the appeal of
petitioner, National Federation of Labor is hereby given due course and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Order </span>of the Med-Arbiter is set

<p class="BODY">ALU sought <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> of the
above-cited decision but to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the instant petition for <i>certiorari.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleges that in granting the petition for
certification election, the respondent Director acted with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in that:</p>

<blockquote>"I<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>THE</span> HONORABLE
DIRECTOR MISSED THE LEGAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 257 AS AMENDED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER
111.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II<span class="GramE">.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>THE</span> HONORABLE DIRECTOR ERRED IN
CLAIMING THAT THE PETITION IS SUPPORTED BY MORE THAN TWENTY (20%) <span class="GramE">OF THE RANK AND FILE.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>III<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>THE</span> RATIFICATION OF
THE CONCLUDED COLLECTIVE <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">BARGAINING </span>AGREEMENT
RENDERS THE CERTIFICATION ELECTION MOOT AND ACADEMIC."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds the petition bereft of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner hinges its claim on Art. 257 of the Labor Code which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 257.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Petitions in unorganized establishments</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any establishment where there is no
certified bargaining agent, the petition for certification <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">election filed by a legitimate labor
organization shall be supported by the written consent of at least twenty (20%)
</span>percent of all the employees in the bargaining unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">verification of such petition, the Med-Arbiter shall automatically
order the conduct of a certification election."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But this provision finds no application in the case at bar
primarily because it applies to unorganized establishments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the said provision to apply, the
establishment concerned must have no certified bargaining agent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This </span>is
not the case in the present <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petition </span>where
there was a collective bargaining agreement entered into by the management of
the <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> Fruits Corporation and ALU, the
petitioner, which was then the bargaining agent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court however, finds that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is Article </span>256 as amended by Executive Order 111 which must be
considered in the resolution of the present petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said article states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><u>"Article 256.</u></span><u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Representation Issues in
Organized Establishments<span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">.</span></span></u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In organized establishments, when a petition
questioning the majority status of the incumbent bargaining agent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">before the Ministry <u>within the sixty (60) day period before the
expiration of the collective </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

12.0pt"> the Med-Arbiter shall automatically order an election</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> by secret ballot to ascertain the will of
the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit." (Underscoring supplied)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A review of the records of this case would confirm the fact that
the petition for certification election filed by NFL on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1987</st1:date> was well within the prescribed
sixty (60) day freedom period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner however maintains that the respondent Director
misconstrued the legal intent behind the above-cited provision and that it
should not have been given a literal interpretation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">insists </span>further that the right of the
members of the bargaining unit to choose which union should represent them is
not an absolute one since a prior hearing must be had to ascertain the veracity
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the allegations contained in
the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of Article 256 which provides that <u>the Med-Arbiter
shall automatically order an election</u> is clear and leaves no room for
further interpretation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere filing
of a petition for certification election within the freedom period is
sufficient basis for the respondent Director to order the holding a
certification election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
NFL did not appear during the hearings set by the Med-Arbiter is of no
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the S</span>olicitor General correctly pointed out, there is no
prohibition on the conduct of hearings by the Med-Arbiter on the competing
stands of the unions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither does the
law require the same to be held whereby the absence or presence <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> of any union representative would affect the
petition for certification election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">it is </span>the denial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the </span>petition for certification election grounded solely on the
absence of NFL in the scheduled hearings which is frowned upon by the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is consistent with the principle in
labor legislation that "certification proceedings is not a litigation in
the sense in which the term is ordinarily understood, but an investigation of
non-adversary and fact finding character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As such, it is not bound by technical rules of evidence."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner suggests that to grant the petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for </span>certification election would “open
the floodgates to <span class="GramE">unbridled</span> and scrupulous (sic)
petitions whose only objective is to prejudice the industrial peace and
stability existing in the Company."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court believes however that the workers’ choice regarding their
representative who inevitably reflects and works for their common interest is
of paramount importance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This policy was
lengthily explained in the concurring opinion of then Chief Justice Fernando in
the case of <span class="SpellE">Confediration</span> of Citizens Labor Unions
(CCLU) vs. National Labor Relations Commission<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
where he categorically stated that "the slightest doubt therefore cannot
be entertained that what possesses significance in a petition for certification
is that through such a device the employees are given the opportunity to make
known <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">who shall have the right to
represent them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is equally
important is that not only some but all of them </span>should have the right to
do so."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next contends that the respondent Director erred in
relying upon the claim of the respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place> that the
petition for <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">certification election is
supported </span>by more than twenty <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">percent
</span>(20%) <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of the rank and file
considering </span>that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">said </span>petition
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">merely contained </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">lone </span>signature of the NFL
representative.</p>

<p class="BODY">This averment is likewise unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner bases <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">its
argument again on Article 257 which </span>prescribes the twenty percent (20%)
requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">it </span>must be reiterated that the said requirement applies only to
unorganized establishments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
Article 256 instead which must be applied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A perusal of the said Article would confirm the falsity of the claim of
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">said provision </span>does it require the
written consent of twenty percent (20%) of the employees <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in the bargaining </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence,
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">issue </span>of whether or not the
petition for certification election is supported by twenty percent (20%) of the
bargaining unit concerned is immaterial to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is
essential is </span>that the petition was filed during the sixty-day freedom
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition to dismiss the petition for certification election<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
filed by NFL and signed by some 224 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">employees
</span>signifying their satisfaction with the services of the incumbent union
should not be given any weight at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The possibility that the workers were merely coerced to sign the
petition such that they did so for fear of reprisal from the members of ALU is
not remote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this does not
discount the possibility that the workers voluntarily signed the said
petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever reason the workers
may have had for signing the same may be ascertained once a certification
election is held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in this
democratic process that the workers are given the opportunity to freely choose,
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>secret </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">ballot</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">who </span>they want to
represent them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this manner, the
workers are free of any undue pressure which either competing union may exert
upon them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the petitioner assails the decision of the respondent
Director on the ground that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">"the </span>ratification
of the collective bargaining agreement renders the certification election moot
and academic."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This contention finds no basis in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was obviously referring to the contract-bar rule
where the law prohibits the holding of certification elections during the
lifetime of the collective bargaining agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said agreement was hastily and prematurely
entered into apparently in an attempt to avoid the holding of a certification <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The records </span>show that the old collective bargaining agreement of
the petitioner with <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> Fruits Corporation was to
expire on <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, three (3) months and eight (8) days
before its expiry date, or on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="6">June 22,
 1987</st1:date>, the petitioner renewed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
same with the consent </span>and collaboration of management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The renewed agreement was then ratified by
the members of the bargaining unit and was thereafter sent to the Bureau of
Labor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Relations for </span>certification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1987</st1:date> (21 days before the expiration of
the old collective bargaining agreement on <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1987</st1:date>) a petition for certification election was
filed by respondent union, NFL.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the
foregoing facts, it is quite obvious that the renewed agreement cannot
constitute a bar to the instant petition for certification election for the
very reason that the same was not yet in existence when the petition for
certification election was filed on August 10, 1987 inasmuch as the same was to
take effect only on September 1, 1987, after the old agreement expires on
August 31, 1987.</p>

Article 254 provides that "when there is a collective bargaining agreement,
the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that neither party shall
terminate or modify such agreement during its lifetime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, either party can serve a written
notice to terminate or modify the same at least sixty (60) days prior to its
expiration date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the duty of
both parties to respect the terms and conditions of the existing agreement
during the sixty-day period and/or until a new agreement is reached by the
parties."</p>
