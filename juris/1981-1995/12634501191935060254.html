aside Resolution No. 1766 of the Monetary Board of the Philippines, dated
September 15, 1972, which forbade the Provident Savings Bank from doing
business in the <span style="">Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the Provident Savings Bank, hereinafter
referred to as PROVIDENT, for short, was incorporated after the Central Bank
had approved its establishment under Monetary Board Resolution No. 572, dated <st1:date month="5" day="3" year="1963">May 3, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its Articles of Incorporation was registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on <st1:date month="10" day="31" year="1963">October 31, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PROVIDENT was granted authority to operate <span style="">by </span>the Monetary Board on <st1:date month="12" day="4" year="1963">December
 4, 1963</st1:date> and started business on <st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1963">December 9, 1963</st1:date> with principal office at <st1:street><st1:address>Villalobos
  St.</st1:address></st1:street>, Quiapo, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within four (4) years of operation, PROVIDENT
had established six (6) extension offices within the greater <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
area.</p>

<p class="BODY">PROVIDENT has an authorized capital of P10 million, divided into
100,000 shares of common stock with a par value of P100.00 each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of its incorporation, 25% of the
stock was subscribed and paid for by its incorporators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were subsequent subscriptions received
so that by the end of 1967 the total paid up capital of the bank amounted to
P6.7 million out of the aggregate P7.5 million subscribed shares of stock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein private respondents, Isidro E.
Fernandez and Jesus R. Jayme, are the majority and controlling stockholders
thereof, holding 41% and 22%, respectively, of the total subscribed capital
stock of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">A major portion of PROVIDENT's loanable funds was granted to
directors, officers and stockholders and their related interests and the bank
was cautioned to avoid con-entration of credits and to adopt a policy where
loans would be granted to a larger number of borrowers who had no financial
interest in the bank.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In September, 1968, a
number of savings banks, PROVIDENT among others, experienced a bank run which
was triggered off by adverse publicity in the newspapers, radio, and television
of investigations conducted by Congress that some banks were unable to pay
deposit withdrawals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the
unusually heavy withdrawals, PROVIDENT had no recourse but to request emergency
loans from the Central Bank to meet the demands of the depositors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Monetary Board, however, denied these
requests for emergency loans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PROVIDENT,
therefore, had to borrow from other banks, foremost of which is the Banco
Filipino Mortgage and Savings Bank which granted PROVIDENT advances up to P8
million, on the security of real estate properties and a pledge of P4.074
million worth of shares of stock representing about 60% of the outstanding
shares of stock of PROVI足DENT owned by Fernandez and Jayme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, these loans were not enough to meet the
demands of the depositors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result,
PRO足VIDENT was forced to temporarily close its doors to the public on </span><st1:date month="9" day="12" year="1968"><span style="">September
 12, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, however,
the Central Bank extended emergency loans to PROVIDENT in order to stop the
bank run and to prevent the bank run from eroding the confidence of the public
in the banking system, thus enabling PROVIDENT to reopen on </span><st1:date month="9" day="16" year="1968"><span style="">September
 16, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hon. Alfonso Calalang, then Governor of
the Central Bank, together with other high officials of the Central Bank,
visited the premises of PROVIDENT soon after its reopening and assured the
public that PROVIDENT was sound and had the full backing of the Central Bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then followed a series of
emergency releases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the assistance
given to PROVIDENT was not sufficient to meet and service the unusually heavy
withdrawals of deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernandez and
Jayme appealed to the Central Bank for continued assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one time, Fernandez and Jayme were
summoned to the Central Bank for a conference with the Governor and Deputy
Governor and were introduced to representatives of the </span><i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo (INK)</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">which had a sizeable deposit of P5.5 million
with PROVIDENT and was having difficulty in withdrawing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Central Bank Deputy Governor Amado Bri単as
voiced the decision of the Central Bank that unless Fernandez and Jayme
relinquished and turned over the management and control of PROVIDENT to the </span><i><span style="">I</span></i><i><span style="">g</span></i><i><span style="">lesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">the Central Bank would not further support
and assist the distressed PROVIDENT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Governor
Bri単as, in turn, persuaded the representatives of the </span><i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">headed by Rogelio Manalo, that the only way
they could withdraw their deposit was to take control and management of
PROVIDENT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Left with no other
alternative, but to accede, and in order to protect their investment, Fernandez
and Jayme reluctantly executed a Memorandum Agreement with the Eagle
Broadcasting Corporation, a company identified with the </span><i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date month="12" day="6" year="1968"><span style="">December 6, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
parties therein made the following commitments:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span style="">the
</span><i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span>will
convert its time deposit <span style="">with the </span>Bank
in the amount of P5.5 million into voting preferred shares of stock;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the stockholders will cause the <span style="">amend</span>ment of the Articles of
Incorporation to increase the capital stock by creating voting preferred shares
of <span style="">stock at a par value of P</span>70.00
<span style="">per shares;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the <i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span>shall
purchase from Fernandez and Jayme group 53,000 shares of stock within the
period of <span style="">six
</span><span style="">months;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Fernandez and Jayme group shall
execute a voting trust agreement in favor of the <i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">group
to subsist only until the amendment to the Articles </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Incorporation shall have been registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission; and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
the </span><i>Iglesia Ni Kristo</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">group shall not foreclose mortgages securing
loans of various borrowers until after four years, provided that the schedule
of payments on loans of the Fernandez and Jayme group shall be complied with.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Immediately thereafter, a special meeting of the stockholders of
PROVIDENT was convened and the Articles of Incorporation of the bank was
amended to comply with the terms and stipulations contained in the Memorandum
Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Voting Trust Agreement was,
likewise, executed in favor of the Eagle Broadcasting Corporation on certain
shares of stock owned by Reynaldo Panopio, a stockholder identified with the
Fernandez and Jayme group, after which Fernandez and Jayme withdrew from the
management of PROVIDENT in favor of the <i>Iglesia Ni Kristo</i><span style=""> </span>group effective December 1, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following the transfer of management of PROVIDENT to the <i>Iglesia
Ni Kristo</i><span style="">, </span>the Central Bank
forthwith released additional loans to <span style="">PROVIDENT
at </span>a much reduced rate of interest of 10% instead of the 12% interest
charged on previous loans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PROVIDENT was
further allowed to resume its lending activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the trans足fer of the
management to the <i>Iglesia Ni Kristo</i><span style=""> </span>the net worth of PROVIDENT was P7.2 million.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Eagle Broadcasting
Corporation, however, did not comply with its commitment to purchase 53,000
common shares of stock and to convert its deposits into equity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the new management of PROVIDENT
caused the conversion of the deposits of </span><i>Iglesia Ni K</i><i><span style="">risto</span></i><span style=""> </span>into "bills payable" earning 12% interest, which were
subsequently withdrawn.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
PROVIDENT, under the new management, also failed to comply with the Monetary
Board directives relative to the rehabilitation of the bank so that it restored
the interest rate of 12% on outstanding loans.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Various irregularities detrimental to PROVIDENT were also perpetrated by the
new management despite the presence of resident Central Bank examiners.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The <i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span>likewise
facilitated or caused the assignment and mortgage of PROVIDENT's various
assets, receivables, and in足terests in favor of the Eagle Broadcasting
Corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the deteriorating financial condition of PROVIDENT,
the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank separately met with the representatives
of the <i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span>and the
majority stockholders of the bank to discuss with them the urgency of finding a
solution to PROVIDENT's financial difficulties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both parties were requested to submit their proposals pertaining to the
continued operation and management of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his letter dated October 15, 1971, Rogelio W. Manalo, President and
Chairman of the Board of Directors of PROVIDENT submitted a set of proposals
consisting of three (3) courses of action, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>conversion of the P4 million "bills
payable" of the <i><span style="">Iglesia Ni
Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span>to equity; staggered payment to the <i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span>of the balance of its deposits; and
pre-payment of borrowings of majority stockholders at the rate of P300,000.00
monthly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, these proposals were
rejected by the Monetary Board on <st1:date month="1" day="7" year="1972">January
 7, 1972</st1:date> (Res. No. 6).<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1972">August 22, 1972</st1:date>,
Rogelio W. Manalo resigned as Chairman and President of PROVIDENT, giving rise
to large withdrawals from its big depositors which the bank could not readily
meet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PROVIDENT had to seek assistance
from other banks, the Savings Bankers Association of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and other sources to pr<span style="">ev</span>ent the
recurrence of another bank run.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
But, the financial condition of PROVIDENT continued to worsen, so that on
September 15, 1972, the Monetary Board, after "considering further that
the principal stockholders and/or the <i>Iglesia Ni </i><i style="">Kristo</i>/Eagle Broadcasting Corporation group have not come up with
concrete and substantial proposals towards the rehabilitation of the Provident
Savings Bank, which proposals were required of them in the conference held in
September of 1971; and in pursuance of Section 29 of Republic Act No. 265,
decided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"'a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To forbid the
Provident Savings Bank to do business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

Act No. <span style="">265; and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, the Central Bank instructed its Legal Counsel
on <st1:date month="9" day="25" year="1972">September 25, 1972</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To request the Solicitor General to file,

<p class="BODY">Consequently, on September 28, 1972, Fernandez and Jayme filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> and/or specific
performance, with preliminary injunction, against the Central Bank and Eagle

therein as Sp. Proc. No. 88415, to annul and set aside the said Monetary Board
Resolution No. 1766, dated September 15, 1972 and to restrain the Central Bank
from liquidating PROVIDENT, and, instead, to order the Central Bank to comply with
its commitments to the petitioners and reorganize and rehabilitate PROVIDENT in

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the present

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner claims
that the respondent Court of Appeals erred in not applying Presidential Decree
No. 1007, dated September 22, 1976, which amended Section 29 of Republic Act
No. 265 during the pendency of the appeal and should have dismissed the
petition of Fernandez and Jayme in view of the findings of the said appellate
court that there is no clear proof of gross and evident bad faith on the part
of the petitioner and the Eagle Broadcasting Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of its contention, the petitioner
invokes the case of <i>Lucas Ramirez vs. The Hon. Court </i><i><span style="">of </span>Appeals, et al.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, the appellate
court, in reviewing a judgment on appeal, should dispose of a question
according to the law prevailing at the time of such disposition and not
according to the law prevailing at the time of the rendition of the appealed
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Section </span>29
<span style="">of Republic Act No. </span>265, <span style="">as amended by Presidential Decree No. </span>1007,
<span style="">should be applied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under this section, as
amended, the action of the Monetary Board in ordering the closure and
liquidation of an insolvent bank is final and executory and can be set aside
only if there is convincing proof that the action is plainly arbitrary and made
in bad faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The petition filed, however, should not
be dismissed for while there may not <span style="">be
</span>gross and evident bad faith on the part of the Central Bank and Eagle
Broadcasting Corporation to sustain the award of damages to<span style=""> </span>Fernandez and Jayme, as ordered by
the trial court, the action of the Monetary Board in forbidding PROVIDENT from
doing business in the Philippines and ordering its liquidation is clearly
arbitrary and was made in bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arbitrariness and bad faith of the petitioner is evident from
the fact that it pressured Fernandez and Jayme<span style=""> </span>into relinquishing the management and control <span style="">of </span>PROVIDENT to the <i>Iglesia Ni
Kristo (INK)</i><span style=""> </span>which did not
have any intention of restoring the bank into its former sound financial
condition but whose interest was merely to recover its deposits from PROVIDENT,
and, therafter, allowing the <i>Iglesia Ni </i><i><span style="">Kristo</span></i><span style=""> to </span>mismanage PROVIDENT until the bank's financial deterioration
and subsequent closure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial
court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Having decided in 1968 that <span style="">PROVIDENT </span>was sal<span style="">vageable

helping improve the situation of PROVIDENT, actually aggravated further its
financial position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And what is most
amazing, while this is being done <span style="">to a </span>bank
in distress, the CB was willing to give loans to a well-off bank, the Banco
Filipino, loans at an interest of only 4%."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the Central Bank has already rehabilitated similarly
distressed banks, the Republic Bank and the Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
among several others, so that it would be unjust to PROVIDENT to be deprived of
the Central Bank's continued support.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner next
claims that the Court of Appeals erred in not holding that there can be no
estoppel against the petitioner in view of the latter's valid exercise of
police power by its lawful overseeing of Provident Savings Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the closure and liquidation of a bank may be considered an
exercise of police power, the validity of such exercise of police power is
subject to judicial inquiry and could be set aside if it is either capricious,
discriminatory, whimsical, arbitrary, unjust, or a denial of the due process
and equal protection clauses of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases under consideration, it is not
disputed that the Central Bank had committed itself to support PROVIDENT and
restore it to its former sound financial position provided that Fernandez and
Jayme should relinquish and give up its control and management of the bank to
the <i><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style="">, </span>and
thereafter, whimsically withdrew such support to the detriment of
PROVIDENT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <i><span style="">Ramos vs. Central Bank</span></i><i style=""><span style="">,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where the
Central Bank committed itself to the continued operation of, and rehabilitation
of the Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, and
later on reneged on that promise, the Court therein ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Even in the absence of contract, the record plainly shows
that the CB made express representations to petitioners herein that it would
support the OBM and avoid its liquidation if the petitioners would execute (a)
the Voting Trust Agree<span style="">ment turning over
the management of OBM to the CB or its nominees, and (b) mortgage or assign
their properties to the Central Bank to cover the overdraft balance of
OBM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners having complied
with these conditions and parted with value to the profit of the CB (which thus
acquired additional security for its own advances), the CB may not </span><span style="">now </span><span style="">renege on its representations and liquidate </span>the <span style="">OBM, to the detriment of its stockholders,
depositors and other creditors, under the rule of </span><i><span style="">promissory estoppel</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">(19
Am. Jur., pp. 657?658, 28 Am. Jur. 2d, 656-657; Ed. Note. 115 ALR, 157).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The broad general <span style="">rule
</span>to the effect that a promise to do or not to do something in the future
does not work an estoppel must be qualified, since there are numerous cases in
which an estoppel has been predicated on promises or assurances as to future
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of 'promissory
estoppel' is <span style="">by </span>no means new,
although the name has been adopted only in comparatively recent years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to that doctrine, an estoppel <span style="">may arise from the making of a promise, even
though without consideration, if it was intended that the promise should be
relied upon and in fact it was relied upon, and if a refusal to enforce it
would be virtually to sanction the perpetration of fraud or would result in other
injustice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this respect, the reliance
by the promise is generally evidenced </span>by <span style="">action or forbearance on his part, and the idea has been expressed that
such action of forbearance would reasonably have been expected by the </span><span style="">promissor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">Mere omission by the
promisee </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">do </span>whatever the <span style="">promissor promised </span>to <span style="">do has been held insufficient 'forbearance'
to give rise to a promissory estoppel.' (19 </span><span style="">Am </span><span style="">Jur. <i>loc</i></span><i style=""><span style=""> cit</span></i><span style="">.)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the petitioner claims
that the Court of Appeals erred in not appreciating certain facts, mainly
PROVIDENT's anomalous grant of substantial loans to its own directors,
officers, stockholders, and related interests, which caused its insolvency,
thereby rendering the remedy of liquidation proper and rehabilitation improper.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe that the judgment complained of is based upon substantial
evidence and that the trial court had not overlooked, nor misinterpreted
certain facts and circumstances of weight in making its findings, so that the
respondent appellate <span style="">court </span>did
not commit any error in affirming the said <span style="">judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the issue of
whether or not certain alleged facts should be appreciated is a question of
fact, not properly cognizable on appeal, since it involves an examination of
the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, the fact
that the directors, officers, and stockholders of </span><span style="">PROVIDENT </span><span style="">had been extended loans by the bank which may have caused its
insolvency, is of little importance since these loans were already known to and
taken into consideration by the Central Bank when it decided in 1968 to allow </span><span style="">PROVIDENT </span><span style="">to continue in business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case of </span><i><span style="">Ramos vs. </span></i><i style=""><span style="">Central
</span></i><i><span style="">Bank</span></i><i style=""><span style="">,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">the Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The CB excuses itself by pleading that the OBM officers had
resorted to non-recording of time deposits in the Bank's books and diverting
such deposits to accounts controlled by certain bank officials, and other
irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to note,
however, that these 'unrecorded' deposits were revealed to the CB as early as <st1:date month="9" day="25" year="1967">25 September 1967</st1:date> by the then
President of the OBM, Mr. Martin Oliva, who had no hand in such irregularities
and who informed the Superintendent of Banks that time deposits worth P43,188,009.29
had not been reported to the OBM directors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, on <st1:date month="9" day="29" year="1967">29 September 1967</st1:date>,
the CB had already ordered its examiners to investigate the Bank's records and
determine the parties responsible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notwithstanding knowledge of these irregularities, the CB did not
withdraw its promised support, and insisted on the execution of the Voting
Trust Agreement on <st1:date month="11" day="20" year="1967">20 November 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such attitude imports that, in its opinion,
the irregularities disclosed were not to be blamed on the OBM itself or its
depositors and creditors, but on the officials responsible; and further, that
the OBM could still be saved by adequate aid and management reform, which was <span style="">required </span>by CB's duty to maintain the
stability of the banking system and the preservation of public confidence in it."</blockquote>
