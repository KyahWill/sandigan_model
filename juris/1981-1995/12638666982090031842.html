barrio of <span class="SpellE">Cadlit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>,

T-56897; that he had been in continuous, peaceful, adverse physical possession

area of approximately <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">four (4)

thereon; that his predecessors-in-Â­interest had been in peaceful, adverse, and
continuous possession thereof, in the concept of owners, since time immemorial
until April </span>12, 1964, when they sold the land to him; and that
defendants-appellants are unlawfully withholding the possession of the land

<span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, covered
by Original Certificate of Title No. 6870; that they have been in open,
peaceful, public, continuous and adverse possession thereof since 1924 when
they filed Homestead Application No. 106209 (E-66647); and that they have been
paying taxes thereon from the time a homestead patent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

abbreviate the proceedings to save time and efforts of the Court and the

relocated" (p. 28, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Consequently,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1972</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">The assignment of errors made by defendants-appellants may be
limited to the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the trial court erred in granting

trial court erred in rendering a summary judgment in spite of the fact that all

<p class="BODY">In their brief, defendants-appellants contend that the motion for
summary judgment was not supported by affidavits (as required by Sections 1 and
2 of Rule 34), depositions or admissions (as enunciated in Motor Service Co.,

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>

the rendition of summary judgment for their failure to raise any objections to

indicating that it was the product of serious deliberation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, defendants-appellants did not
specifically deny in their answer the material allegations of the complaint but
merely pleaded ignorance thereof (p. 126, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal lacks merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
shall dispose of the first assignment of error by quoting the relevant portions
of the trial court's order dated <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="3">March

on September 22, 1970, November 16, 1970, January 19 and February 22, 1971

prevail. The Court found said suggestion meritorious considering that a plan

August 8, 1970 (sic) ordering the relocation of the litigated property so that
both counsel were thereafter instructed to submit their memoranda
