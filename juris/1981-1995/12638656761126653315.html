(p. 45, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolcan</span>
appealed Judge Fernandez's decision to the Court of Appeals but upon the
outbreak of the war, all the records of the case were destroyed, both in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> and in the Appellate
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the case were
never <span style="">reconstituted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 15, 1967, a decree of registration and Original
Certificate of Title No. Q-217 were issued by the Land Registration Commission
and the Register of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City,
respectively, in favor of Guzman.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners <span class="SpellE">Lanzona</span> who had
allegedly acquired the rights over the land and improvements existing thereon
from <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolcan</span>
since 1942 and allegedly had been in possession of the said land for a period
of more than twenty-five (25) years as exclusive owners, filed a petition for
review of the decree of registration on the ground of fraud in its issuance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 4, 1968, the private respondent, Emilio Alvarez, as
successor-in-interest of Guzman, opposed the petition for review. He alleged
that Judge Fernandez's decision, dated October 1, 1940, had long become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, hence, it could no longer be set aside
or reviewed; that Original Certificate of Title No. Q-217 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> Guzman was validly issued based on existing
records of the Land Registration Commission (p. 48, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As previously stated, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, acting as a land registration court, ruled in favor
of the petitioners.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, in its decision dated June 10, 1982, the Appellate Court
reversed the appealed judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the trial court committed the errors
imputed to it by appellant, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and
another one entered dismissing the petition for review of the decree of
registration for lack of merit - thus by this pronouncement, Decree No.
N-118060 and Original Certificate of Title No. Q-217 of the Registry of Deeds
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City in the name of <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span>
Guzman issued pursuant to the said decree are declared legal and valid for all
intents and purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (p. 62, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A petition for review was filed in due time in this Court by <span class="SpellE">Lanzona</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question to be determined <span style="">is </span>whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding for respondent
Alvarez and in finding that there was no fraud <span style="">in </span>the issuance of the decree of registration for Lot No. 384
and of Certificate of Title No. Q-217, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span>
Guzman, Alvarez's predecessor-in-interest, based on the <span class="SpellE">unreconstituted</span>
pre-war decision of Judge Enrique Fernandez in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>petition is
devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not fraud exists is a factual <span style="">issue </span>which we may not review under Rule 45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, <span style="">the </span>respondent Court of Appeals did not commit a<span style=""> </span>reversible error in finding that there
was no fraud in the rendition of Judge <span style="">Fernandez’s
</span>decision although he relied, among other evidences in the records, on a
decision of the Supreme Court which was not certified to be true and
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court correctly
ruled that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> the argument that because the decision of the
Supreme Court which was relied upon by the trial court in granting registration
was not certified to be true and correct, fraud <span style="">was </span>committed justifying the petition for the review of the
decree <span style="">of </span>registration, is
plainly an error of judgment <span style="">or </span>at
the most error <span style="">in the </span>appreciation
and the admission of an evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no fraud, much less the fraud contemplated by Section 38 of Act 496, as
ground for the petition for a review of the decree." (p. 51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the finality of Judge Fernandez’s <span class="SpellE">unreconstituted</span><span style=""> </span>pre-war decision, we also agree with
the finding <span style="">of </span>the Court of
Appeals that:</p>

<blockquote>"Anent the status of the decision dated October 1, 1940 of the
late Judge Enrique Fernandez, after going over the evidence in this case, We
are of the considered opinion that the same has become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation that the same was duly
appealed to Us and the appeal perfected was not satisfactorily substantiated.
At any rate, even admitting that the decision was appealed, as unfortunately
the records were destroyed during the last World War, the duty to reconstitute
the appeal falls on the appellant (the predecessor-in-interest <span style="">of the </span><span class="SpellE">appellees</span>)
and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> themselves in behalf of their <span class="SpellE">predecesor</span>-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The failure to institute the reconstitution proceedings by the party
most interested to up-end the decision should be interpreted as an abandonment
of the appeal and a clear indication of lack of interest and this abandonment
made the decision final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the
case, a copy of the decision having been shown to exist, reconstitution of the
decision <span style="">is </span>not necessary or,
otherwise stated, it was error for the trial court to hold that the decision of
October 1, 1940 has lost its force and effect and that said decision should be
reconstituted by means of an authentic copy and, if this cannot be done, the
trial court is empowered to make a<span style=""> ne</span>w
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We again have to agree <span style="">with </span>the appellant in his argument that
Rule<span style=""> </span>39, Section 6 of the Rules
of Court is not applicable to land registration proceedings x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (p. 52, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' claim of ownership by acquisitive prescription
or by virtue of alleged continuous and undisturbed possession of the disputed
lot, clearly raises factual issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
finding of the appellate court that "the evidence of the petitioners do
not show that the parcel of land which they purchased from <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bolcan</span> <span style="">is </span>the
same Lot No. 384 covered by O.C.T. Q-217" is a factual finding which is
binding on us, especially because the Court discussed the evidence supporting
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is not the </span>function of the Supreme Court to analyze or weigh such
evidence all over again, its jurisdiction being limited to reviewing errors of
law that might have been committed by the lower court (Evangelista &amp; Co. v.
<span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, 51 SCRA 416).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is DENIED for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Intermediate<span style=""> </span>Appellate Court in CA G.R. No. 52469-R
