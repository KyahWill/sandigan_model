<p class="BODY">The crucial issue in this case is whether or not petitioner PPC
whose oil products are subject to specific ta<span style="">x</span> under the NIRC, is still liable to pay (a) tax on business and
(b) storage fees, considering Provincial Circular No. 6-77; and mayor's permit
and sanitary inspection <span style="">fee </span>unto
the respondent Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pililla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, based on Municipal Ordinance No. 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner PPC contends that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) Provincial Circular No. 26-73 declared as contrary to national
economic policy the imposition of local taxes on the manufacture of petroleum
products as they are already subject to specific tax under the National Internal
Revenue Code; (b) the above declaration covers not only old<span style=""> </span>tax ordinances but new<span style=""> </span>ones, as well as those which may be
enacted in the future; (c) both Provincial Circulars (PC) 26-73 and 26 A-73 are
still effective, hence, unless and until revoked, any effort on the part of the
respondent to collect the suspended tax on business from the petitioner would
be illegal and unauthorized; and (d) Section 2 of P.D. 436 prohibits the
imposition of local taxes on petroleum products.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">PC </span><span style="">No. </span>26-73 and PC No. 26 A-73
suspended the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of local tax ordinances
imposing a tax on business under Section 19 (a) of the Local Tax Code <span style="">(P.D. </span>No. 231), with regard to
manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers or dealers in petroleum products subject
to the specific tax under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), in view of
Section 22 (b) of the Code regarding non-imposition <span style="">by </span>municipalities of taxes on articles, subject to specific tax
under the provisions of the NIRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that <span class="SpellE">Pililla's</span>
Municipal Tax Ordinance No. 1 imposing the assailed taxes, fees and charges is
valid especially Section 9 (A) which according to the trial court “was lifted <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> and/or <span style="">is </span>a literal reproduction of Section 19 (a) of the Local Tax
Code as amended by P.D. No. 426."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It conforms with the mandate of said law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But</span> <span style="">P.D. </span>No. 426 amending the Local Tax
Code is deemed to have repealed Provincial Circular Nos. 26-73 and 26 A-73
issued by the Secretary of Finance when Sections 19 and 19 (a), were carried
over into P.D. No. 426 and no exemptions were given to manufacturers, <span style="">wh</span>olesalers, retailers, or dealers in
petroleum products.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Well-settled is the rule
that administrative regulations must be </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">harmony with the
provisions of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of
discrepancy between the basic law and an implementing rule or regulation, the
former </span><span style="">prevails </span><span style="">(Shell Philippines, Inc. v. Central Bank of
the Philippines, 162 SCRA 628 [1988]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As aptly held </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the </span>court <u>a</u> q<u>uo</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"Necessarily, there could not be any other logical conclusion
than that the framers of P.D. No. 426 really and actually intended to terminate
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> and/or enforceability of Provincial
Circulars Nos. 26-73 and 26 A-73 inasmuch as clearly these circulars are in
contravention with Sec. 19 <span style="">(a) </span>of
P.D. 426 - the amendatory law to P.D. No. 231.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That intention to terminate is very apparent and in fact it is expressed
in clear and unequivocal terms in the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> and
repealing clause of P.D. 426 <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, while Section
2 of </span>P.D. 436 prohibits the imposition of local taxes on petroleum
products, <span style="">said decree did not amend </span>Sections
19 and 19 (a) of P.D. 231 as amended by P.D. 426, wherein the municipality is
granted the right to levy taxes on business of manufacturers, importers,
producers of any article of commerce of whatever kind or nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A tax on business is distinct from a tax on
the article itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if the
imposition of tax on business <span style="">of </span>manufacturers,
etc. in petroleum products contravenes <span style="">a </span>declared national policy, it should have <span style="">been </span>expressly stated in P.D. No. 436.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
exercise by local governments of the power to </span>tax <span style="">is </span>ordained by the present
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To <span style="">allow </span>the continuous <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the prohibition set forth in PC No. 26-73
(1) would be tantamount to restricting their power to tax by mere
administrative issuances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section
5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, only guidelines and limitations that may
be established by Congress can define and limit such power of local
governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Each local government unit shall have the power to create its
own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to such
guidelines and limitations as the <span style="">Congress may </span>provide, consistent with the
basic policy of local autonomy x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Provincial Circular No. 6-77 enjoining all city and municipal
treasurers to refrain from collecting the so-called storage fee on flammable or
combustible materials imposed in the local tax ordinance of their respective
locality frees petitioner PPC from the payment of storage permit fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The storage permit fee being imposed by <span class="SpellE">Pililla's</span>
tax ordinance is a fee for the installation and keeping in storage of any
flammable, combustible or explosive substances.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as said storage makes use of tanks
owned not by the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pililla</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, but by petitioner
PPC, same is obviously not a charge for any service rendered by the
municipality as what is envisioned in Section 37 <span style="">of </span>the <span style="">same </span>Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 10 (z) (13) of <span class="SpellE">Pililla's</span>
Municipal Tax Ordinance No. 1 prescribing a permit fee is a permit fee allowed
under Section 36 of the amended Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the authority of the mayor to waive payment of the mayor's
permit and sanitary inspection fees, the trial court did not err in holding
that "since the power to tax includes the power to exempt thereof which <span style="">is </span>essentially a legislative
prerogative, it follows that a municipal mayor who is an executive officer may
not unilaterally withdraw such an expression of a policy thru the enactment of
a tax." The waiver partakes of the nature of an exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an ancient rule that exemptions from
taxation are construed in <span class="SpellE"><u>strictissimi</u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span> </span>against
the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority (<span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Standard Eastern, Inc. v. Acting Commissioner of
Customs, 18 SCRA 488 [1966]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tax
exemptions are looked upon with disfavor (Western <span class="SpellE">Minolco</span>
Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 124 SCRA 121 [1983]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the absence of a clear and express
exemption from the payment of said fees, the waiver cannot be recognized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, it is the law-making body,
and not an executive like the mayor, who can make an exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 36 of the Code, a permit fee
like the mayor's permit, shall be required before any individual or juridical
entity shall <span style="">engage </span>in any
business <span style="">or </span>occupation under
the provisions of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, since the Local Tax Code does not provide the
prescriptive period for collection of local taxes, Article 1143 of the Civil
Code applies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said law provides that an
action upon an obligation created by law prescribes within ten (10) years from
the time the right of action accrues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pililla</span></st1:placename></st1:place> can therefore enforce
the collection of the tax on business of petitioner PPC due from 1976 to 1986,
and NOT the tax that had accrued prior to 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, with the MODIFICATION that business
taxes accruing PRIOR to 1976 are not to be paid by PPC (because the same have
prescribed) and that storage fees are not also to be paid by PPC (for the
storage tanks are owned by PPC and not by the municipality, and therefore
cannot be a charge for service by the municipality), the assailed DECISION <span style="">is </span>hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
