				<H3>ZONSAYDA L. ALINSUG, PETITIONER, VS. REGIONAL
TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 58, SAN CARLOS CITY, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, PRESIDED BY HON.
ROLINDO D. BELDIA, JR.; ROLANDO P. PONSICA AS MUNICIPAL MAYOR OF ESCALANTE,
NEGROS OCCIDENTAL; MUNICIPALITY OF ESCALANTE, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, AND PATRICIO
A. ALVAREZ AS MUNICIPAL TREASURER OF ESCALANTE, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VITUG, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner, Zonsayda L. Alinsug, had been a regular employee
of the municipal government of Escalante, Negros Occidental; when she received
a permanent appointment as Clerk III in the Office of the Municipal Planning
and Development Coordinator of the same municipality.  On 10 June 1992, she received an order from the newly proclaimed
mayor, Rolando P. Ponsica, detailing her to the Office of the Mayor.  In compliance with the order, she reported
to said office the following day.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 June 1992, Zonsayda absented herself from work allegedly to
attend to family matters.  She had asked
permission from the personnel officer but not from the mayor.  On 23 June 1992, Mayor Ponsica issued Office
Order No. 31, suspending Zonsayda for one month and one day commencing on 24
June 1992 for "a simple misconduct x x x which can also be categorized as
an act of insubordination." The order also stated that the suspension
"carries with it forfeiture of x x x benefits such as x x x salary and
PERA and leave credits during the duration of its effectivity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">Forthwith, Zonsayda filed with the
Regional Trial Court of Negros Occidental, in San Carlos City, a petition,
dated 07 July 1992, for "injunction with damages and prayer for temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction" against Mayor Ponsica and
the municipal treasurer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioner alleged that since her family supported Mayor Ponsica's rival in
the 11 May 1992 elections, her suspension was an act of "political
vendetta".  Further alleging that
said respondents' acts were "malicious, illegal, unwarranted, wrongful and
condemnable", petitioner prayed for the following reliefs:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed to
this Honorable Court -<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.1  That upon the filing of this petition a
temporary restraining order be immediately issued directing respondents mayor
and municipality to  cease and desist
from continuing with the suspension, and indefinite detail of petitioner at his
office, and, including the respondent treasurer to refrain from forfeiting and
not paying her salary for the period from June 24 to July 23, 1992, and in the
meantime to return petitioner to her position as Clerk III in the office of the
Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator; to restrain respondents mayor
and municipality also from persecuting, oppressing, harassing and humiliating petitioner
as civil service employee of the municipality under the respondent mayor, and
also restraining them from doing acts and things or employing tactics, schemes
or maneuvers that would make it hard or effect a difficulty in petitioner's
doing of her works and/or in the performance of the official function of her
position entitled to the emoluments thereof, until further orders from the
Honorable Court; and after notice and hearing to issue the corresponding writ
of preliminary injunction;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.2  After trial on the merit, to render
judgment declaring petitioner's detail at respondent's office per Annex 'C' and
suspension per Annex 'D', null and void, and making the injunction permanent;
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.3  Adjudging the respondents mayor and
municipality solidarily to pay petitioner the amount of P30,000.00 for moral
damages; P10,000.00 plus P500.00 per court appearance of petitioner's counsel
for attorney's fee, and P3,000.00 for litigation expenses, all in concept of
actual and compensatory damages; P20,000.00 as exemplary damages; and to pay
the costs of this suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Further, petitioner respectfully prays for such other proper
reliefs and remedies just and appropriate in the premises."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mayor Ponsica and the municipal treasurer filed an answer to the
petition, through private practitioner Samuel SM Lezama, alleging that the
petitioner had not exhausted administrative remedies and that her suspension
was in accordance with law.  They filed
a counterclaim for moral damages in the amount of P200,000.00, exemplary
damages for P50,000.00, and attorney's fees of P30,000.00, plus appearance fee
of P500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing elicited a motion from the petitioner, praying that
the answer be disregarded and expunged from the record, and that the
respondents be all declared in default on the ground that since the respondents
were sued in their official capacities, "not including their private
capacities," they should have been represented by either the municipal
legal officer or the provincial legal officer or prosecutor as provided for by
Sec. 481 (b) [i] and [3] of the Local Government Code.  It also cited Sec. 1 of Rep. Act No. 10 and
Art. 177 of the Revised Penal Code which penalizes usurpation of public
authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents opposed the motion.  Manifesting that the municipality of Escalante has no legal
officer, they asserted that both the Local Government Code and the
Administrative Code of 1987 do not have any provision "relative to the
duty of any provincial legal officer or prosecutor to represent a municipality
or its officials in suits filed against them by an employee or a private
individual." They contended that it was "unnecessary to provide such
a provision because there (exist) administrative and judicial rulings
sustaining the validity of the employment of a private counsel by municipal
officials." Moreover, since the petitioner prayed for the award of moral
damages," on the strength of this Court's ruling in <u>Albuera</u> <u>v</u>.
<u>Torres</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
their hiring of a private counsel was justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 August 1992, Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Daniel M.
Villaflor entered his appearance as "counsel for Rolando P. Ponsica and
Patricio A. Alvarez in their official capacities."</p>

<p class="BODY">With the filing of said notice of appearance, on 08 September
1992, the lower court issued an Order, denying petitioner's motion to declare
the respondents in default and motion to expunge from the record respondents'
answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner,
the lower court issued the Order of 16 November 1992, denying said motion on
the thesis that since the appointment of a legal officer was optional on the
part of the municipal government (Art. 481, third paragraph, Local Government
Code) and the municipality of Escalante had not, in fact, designated any such
legal officer, petitioner's move to declare respondents in default "for
having retained a private counsel" was not thereby legally sustainable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition, which, although called a
"petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>" in its first paragraph,
shall be treated as a special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> for purposes of
resolving the issues of:  (a) whether or
not a private counsel may represent municipal officials sued in their official
capacities, and (b) whether or not respondents had been in default on account of
their having filed their answer through a private counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 443 (b) of the Local Government Code (Republic Act No.
7160), which took effect on 01 January 1992,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
provides that, in addition to the officials enumerated in the first paragraph
thereof, the mayor <u>may</u> appoint, among other officials enumerated
therein, a municipal legal officer.  Section 481, Article 11 of Title V of the Code which provides for the
appointment of local officials common to all municipalities, cities and
provinces, states that "(t)he appointment of a legal officer shall be
mandatory for the provincial and city governments and optional for the
municipal government." The same section specifies the functions of the
legal officer, and one of them being that he shall:</p>

<blockquote>"(i)  Represent the local government unit in all
civil actions and special proceedings wherein the local government unit or any
official thereof, in his official capacity, is a party:  <u>Provided</u>, that in actions or
proceedings where a component city or municipality is a party adverse to the
provincial government or to another component city or municipality, a special
legal officer may be employed to represent the adverse party;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it appears that the law allows a private counsel to be
hired by a municipality only when the municipality is an adverse party in a
case involving the provincial government or another municipality or city within
the province.  This provision has its
apparent origin in the ruling in <u>De</u> <u>Guia</u> <u>v</u>. <u>The</u> <u>Auditor</u>
<u>General</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court held that the municipality's authority to employ a private
attorney is expressly limited only to situations where the provincial fiscal
would be disqualified to serve and represent it.  With Sec. 1683 of the old Administrative Code<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
as legal basis, the Court therein cited <u>Enriquez</u>, <u>Sr</u>. <u>v</u>. <u>Gimenez</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which enumerated instances when the provincial fiscal is disqualified to
represent in court a particular municipality:  if and when original jurisdiction of case involving the municipality is
vested in the Supreme Court, when the municipality is a party adverse to the
provincial government or to some other municipality in the same province, and
when, in a case involving the municipality, he, or his wife, or child, is
pecuniarily involved, as heir legatee, creditor or otherwise.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, in <u>Ramos</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court ruled that a municipality may not be represented by a private law
firm which had volunteered its services <u>gratis</u>, in collaboration with
the municipal attorney and the fiscal, as such representation was violative of
Sec. 1683 of the old Administrative Code.  This strict coherence to the letter of the law appears to have been
dictated by the fact that "the municipality should not be burdened with
expenses of hiring a private lawyer" and that "the interests of the
municipality would be best protected if a government lawyer handles its
litigations."</p>

<p class="BODY">But would these proscriptions include public officials?  Not necessarily.  It can happen that a government official, ostensibly acting in
his official capacity and sued in that capacity, is later held to have exceeded
his authority.  On the one hand, his
defense would have then been underwritten by the people's money which
ordinarily should have been his personal expense.  On the other hand, personal liability can attach to him without,
however, his having had the benefit of assistance of a counsel of his own
choice.  In <u>Correa</u> <u>v</u>. <u>CFI</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Bulacan</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>,
the Court held that in the discharge of governmental functions, "municipal
corporations are responsible for the acts of its officers, except if and when,
and only to the extent that, they have acted by authority of the law, and in
conformity with the requirements thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">In such instance, this Court has sanctioned the representation by
private counsel.  In one case, We held
that where rigid adherence to the law on representation of local officials in
court actions could deprive a party of his right to redress for a valid
grievance, the hiring of a private counsel would be proper<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>.  And, in <u>Albuera</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Torres</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court also said that a provincial governor sued in his official capacity
may engage the services of private counsel when "the complaint contains
other allegations and a prayer for moral damages, which, if due from the
defendants, must be satisfied by them in their <u>private</u> capacity."</p>

<p class="BODY">We might also quote the pronouncement of the Court in <u>Urbano</u>
<u>v</u>. <u>Chavez</u>:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"There is likewise another reason x x x why the Office of the
Solicitor General cannot represent an accused in a criminal case.  Inasmuch as the State can speak and act only
by law, whatever it does say and do must be lawful, and that which is unlawful
is not the word or deed of the State, but is the mere wrong or trespass of
those individual persons who falsely speak and act in its name.  Therefore, the accused public official
should not expect the State, through the Office of the Solicitor General, to
defend him for a wrongful act which cannot be attributed to the State itself.  In the same light, a public official who is
sued in a criminal case is actually sued in his personal capacity inasmuch as
his principal, the State, can never be the author of a wrongful act, much less
commit a crime."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><u>Urbano</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Chavez</u>
confronted the issue of whether the Office of the Solicitor General may represent
its own Solicitor General in the preliminary investigation of a criminal
action, or in a civil action for damages, against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The key then to resolving the issue of whether a local government
official may secure the services of private counsel, in an action filed against
him in his official capacity, lies on the nature of the action and the relief
that is sought.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the petition below was filed against respondents as public
officials, its allegations were also aimed at questioning certain acts that can
well bring the case beyond the mere confines of official functions; thus -</p>

<blockquote>"2.12  These actuations of the respondent mayor in
detailing petitioner to his office and eventually suspending her from work,
particularly the latter are no doubt respondent mayor's political vendetta of
petitioner, a vengeance unleased on her for her children's and family's not
going with and voting for him in the May 11, 1992 election and instead
supporting the candidacy of their relative-candidate (Mr. Barcelona) in said
election, who was his greated (sic) worry at that time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.13  The aforesaid acts of respondent mayor are
clearly, apparently and obviously a political harassment and persecution
appreasive (sic), acts of vindictiveness, a grave abuse of executive discretion,
despotic, unjust, unwarranted, condemnable and actionable; the indefinite
detail order and, especially the suspension, were not done in good faith, not
for a valid cause, and done without giving petitioner opportunity to be heard,
hence, null and void for being violative of petitioner's legal and
constitutional right to due process. x x x."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The petition then went on to claim moral
and exemplary damages, as well as litigation expenses, as shown by its prayer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moral damages cannot generally be awarded unless they are the
proximate result of a wrongful act or omission.  Exemplary damages, on the other hand, are not awarded if the
defendant had not acted in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner nor in the
absence of gross or reckless negligence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
A public official, who in the performance of his duty acts in such fashion,
does so in excess of authority, and his actions would be ultra vires<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
that can thereby result in an incurrence of personal liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing considered, We hold that the respondents were
not improperly represented by a private counsel, whose legal fees shall be for
their own account.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the instant petition is hereby
DISMISSED.  The lower court is directed
to proceed with dispatch in the resolution of Special Civil Action No. RTC-371.</p>
