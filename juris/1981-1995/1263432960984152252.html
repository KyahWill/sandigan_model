				<H3>RAFAEL GELOS, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND ERNESTO ALZONA, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court is asked to determine the real status of the petitioner,
who claims to be a tenant of the private respondent and entitled to the
benefits of tenancy laws.  The private
respondent objects, contending that the petitioner is only a hired laborer
whose right to occupy the subject land ended with the termination of their
contract of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject land is a 25,000 square meter farmland situated it
Cabuyao, Laguna, and belonging originally to private respondent Ernesto Alzona
and his parents in equal shares.  On
July 5, 1970, they entered into a written contract with petitioner Rafael Gelos
employing him as their laborer on the land at the stipulated daily wage of
P5.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On September 4, 1973, after Alzona had bought his parents' share and acquired
full ownership of the land, he wrote Gelos to inform him of the termination of
his services and to demand that he vacate the property.  Gelos refused and continued working on the
land.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 1, 1973, Gelos went to the Court of Agrarian Relations
and asked for the fixing of the agricultural lease rental on the property.  He later withdrew the case and went to the
Ministry of Agrarian Reform, which granted his petition.  For his part, Alzona filed a complaint for
illegal detainer against Gelos in the Municipal Court of Cabuyao, but this
action was declared "not proper for trial" by the Ministry of
Agrarian Reform because of the existence of a tenancy relationship between the
parties.  Alzona was rebuffed for the
same reason when he sought the assistance of the Ministry of Labor and later
when he filed a complaint with the Court of Agrarian Relations for a
declaration of non-tenancy and damages against Gelos.  On appeal to the Office of the President, however, the complaint
was declared proper for trial and so de-archived and reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the Regional Trial Court of San Pablo City (which
had taken over the Court of Agrarian Relations under BP 129) rendered a
decision dated April 21, 1987, dismissing the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It found Gelos to be a tenant of the subject property and entitled to remain
thereon as such.  The plaintiff was also
held liable in attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision was subsequently reversed by the Court of
Appeals.  In its judgment promulgated on
November 25, 1988,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
it held that Gelos was not a tenant of the land in question and ordered him to
surrender it to Alzona.  He was also
held liable for the payment of P10,000.00 as attorney's fees and the costs of
the suit.<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The basic question the petitioner now raises before the Court is
essentially factual and therefore not proper in a petition for review under
Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.  Only
questions of law may be raised in this kind of proceeding.  The settled rule is that the factual
findings of the Court of Appeals are conclusive on even this Court as long as
they are supported by substantial evidence.  The petitioner has not shown that his case comes under any of those rare
exceptions when such findings may be validly reversed by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in Talavera v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that a factual conclusion made by the trial court that a person is a
tenant farmer, if it is supported by the minimum evidence demanded by law, is
final and conclusive and cannot be reversed by the appellate tribunals except
for compelling reasons.  In the case at
bar, however, we find with the respondent court that there was such a
compelling reason.  A careful
examination of the record reveals that, indeed, the trial court misappreciated
the facts when it ruled that the petitioner was a tenant of the private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that the findings of the respondent court do not
concur with those of the trial court does not, of course, call for automatic
reversal of the appellate court.  Precisely, the function of the appellate court is to review and, if
warranted, reverse the findings of the trial court.  Disagreement between the two courts merely calls on us to make a
specially careful study of their respective decisions to determine which of
them should be preferred as more conformable to the facts at hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has made this careful study and will sustain the
decision of the respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contract of employment dated July 5, 1970, written in Tagalog
and entitled "Kasunduan ng Upahang Araw," reads pertinently as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.  Ang Unang Panig ay
siyang may-ari at nagtatangkilik ng isang lagay na lupa, sinasaka, na tumatayo
sa Nayon ng Baclaran, Cabuyao, Laguna, na siyang gagawa at sasaka sa lupa, samantalang
ang Ikalawang Panig ay magiging upahan at katulong sa paggawa ng lupa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Ang Unang Panig ay
gustong ipagpatuloy ang pagbubungkal at paggawa ng bukid na binabanggit sa
itaas at ang Ikalawang Panig ay may ibig na magpaupa sa paggawa sa halagang
P5.00 sa bawat araw, walong oras na trabaho gaya ng mga sumusunod:  Patubigan ng linang; pagpapahalabas ng mga
pilapil; pagpapaaldabis sa unang araw ng pag-aararo; pagpapalinis ng damo sa
ibabaw ng pilapil; pagpapakamot (unang pagpapasuyod), pagpapahalang at
pagpapabalasaw (ikalawa't ikatlong pagpapasuyod); isang tao sa pagsasabog ng
abono una sa pagpapantay ng linang; bago magtanim; isang tao sa pagaalaga ng
dapog; upa sa isang tao ng magbobomba ng gamot laban sa pagkapit ng mga kulisap
(mayroon at wala); sa nag-we-weeder; upa sa mga tao na maggagamas at
magpapatubig ng palay; magsasapaw ng mga pilapil at iba pa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Ang Unang Panig at ang
Ikalawang Panig ay nagkasundo na ang huli ay gagawa sa bukid ayon sa nabanggit
sa itaas bilang katulong at upahan lamang.  Ang Unang Panig bukod sa sila ang gagawa at magsasaka ay maaaring umupa
ng iba pang tao manggagawa sa upahang umiiral sang-ayon sa batas katulad ng
pag-aararo, pagpapahulip, pagpapagamas, pagbobomba, pagweweeder, pagsasabog ng
abono, pagbobomba ng gamot, pagpapatubig at iba pang mga gawain.  Maaaring alisin ang Ikalawang Panig sa
pagpapatrabaho sa ano mang oras ng Unang Panig.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Ipinatatanto ng
Ikalawang Panig na siya ay hindi kasama sa bukid kundi upahan lamang na binabayaran
sa bawa’t araw ng kanyang paggawa sa bukid na nabanggit.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is noted that the agreement provides that "ang Ikalawang
Panig (meaning Gelos) ay may ibig na magpaupa sa paggawa sa halagang P5.00 sa
bawa’t araw, walong oras na trabaho" (The Second Party desires to lease
his services at the rate of P5.00 per day, eight hours of work) and that
"Ipinatatanto ng Ikalawang Panig na siya ay hindi kasama sa bukid kundi
upahan lamang na binabayaran sa bawa’t araw ng kanyang paggawa sa bukid na
nabanggit." (The Second Party makes it known that he is not a farm tenant
but only a hired laborer who is paid for every day of work on the said farm.)</p>

<p class="BODY">These stipulations clearly indicate that the parties did not
enter into a tenancy agreement but only a contract of employment.  The agreement is a lease of services, not of
the land in dispute.  This intention is
quite consistent with the undisputed fact that three days before that agreement
was concluded, the former tenant of the land, Leocadio Punongbayan, had
executed an instrument in which he voluntarily surrendered his tenancy rights
to the private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It also clearly demonstrates that, contrary to the petitioner's contention,
Alzona intended to cultivate the land himself instead of placing it again under
tenancy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner would now disavow the agreement, but his
protestations are less than convincing.  His wife's testimony that he is illiterate is belied by his own
testimony to the contrary in another proceeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Her claim that they were tricked into signing the agreement does not stand up
against the testimony of Atty. Santos Pampolina, who declared under his oath as
a witness (and as an attorney and officer of the court) that he explained the
meaning of the document to Gelos, who even read it himself before signing it.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Atty. Pampolina said the agreement was not notarized because his commission as
notary public was good only for Manila and did not cover Laguna, where the
document was executed.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
At any rate, the lack of notarization did not adversely affect the veracity and
effectiveness of the agreement, which, significantly, Gelos and his wife do not
deny having signed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gelos points to the specific tasks mentioned in the agreement and
suggests that they are the work of a tenant and not of a mere hired
laborer.  Not so.  The work specified is not peculiar to
tenancy.  What a tenant may do may also
be done by a hired laborer working under the direction of the landowner, as in
the case at bar.  It is not the nature
of the work involved but the intention of the parties that determines the
relationship between them.</p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court has stressed in a number of cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
"tenancy is not a purely factual relationship dependent on what the
alleged tenant does upon the land.  It
is also a legal relationship.  The
intent of the parties, the understanding when the farmer is installed, and as in
this case, their written agreements, provided these are complied with and are
not contrary to law, are even more important."</p>

<p class="BODY">Gelos presented receipts<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
for fertilizer and pesticides he allegedly bought and applied to the land of
the private respondent, but the latter insists that it was his brother who
bought them, being an agriculturist and in charge of the technical aspect of
the farm.  Moreover, the receipts do not
indicate to which particular landholding the fertilizers would be applied and,
as pointed out by the private respondent, could refer to the other parcels of
and land which Gelos was<i> </i>tenanting.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's payment of irrigation fees from 1980 to 1985 to
the National Irrigation Administration on the said landholding is explained by
the fact that during the pendency of the CAR case, the Agrarian Reform Office
fixed a provisional leasehold rental after a preliminary finding that Gelos was
the tenant of the private respondent.  As such, it was he who had to pay the irrigation fees.  Incidentally, Section 12, subpar. (r) of PD
946 provides that the Secretary's determination of the tenancy relationship
only preliminary and cannot be conclusive on the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that, except for the self-serving testimony of
the petitioner's wife, the records of this case are bereft of evidence
regarding the sharing of harvest between Gelos and Alzona.  No less importantly, as the Court of Appeals
observed, the petitioner has not shown that he paid rentals on the subject
property from 1970 to 1973, before their dispute arose.</p>

<p class="BODY">A tenant is defined under Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 1199
as a person who himself and with the aid available from within his immediate
farm household cultivates the land belonging to or possessed by another, with
the latter's consent, for purposes of production, <u>sharing the produce with
the landholder under the share tenancy system, or paying to the landholder a
price-certain or ascertainable in produce or in money or both, under the
leasehold tenancy system</u>.  (Emphasis
supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">For this relationship to exist, it is necessary that:  1) the parties are the landowner and the
tenant; 2) the subject is agricultural land; 3) there is consent; 4) the
purpose is agricultural production; 5) there is personal cultivation; and 6)
there is sharing of harvest or payment of rental.  In the absence of any of these requisites, an occupant of a
parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or planter thereon, cannot qualify as
a <u>de</u> j<u>ure</u> tenant.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the indications of an employer-employee
relationship are:  1) the selection and
engagement of the employee; 2) the payment of wages; 3) the power of dismissal;
and 4) the power to control the employee's conduct - although the latter is the
most important element.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">According to a well-known authority on the subject,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
tenancy relationship is distinguished from <span style="">farm employer-farm </span>worker relationship in that:  “In farm employer-farm worker relationship,
the lease is one of labor with the agricultural laborer as the lessor of his
services and the farm employer as the lessee thereof.  In tenancy relationship, it is the landowner who is the lessor,
and the tenant the lessee of agricultural land.  The agricultural worker works for the farm employer and for his
labor he receives a salary or wage regardless of whether the employer makes a
profit.  On the other hand, the tenant
derives his income from the agricultural produce or harvest.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, instead of receiving payment of rentals
or sharing in the produce of the land, paid the petitioner lump sums for
specific kinds of work on the subject lot or gave him <u>vales</u>, or advance
payment of his wages as laborer thereon.  The petitioner's wife claims that Alzona made her husband sign the
invoices all at one time because he allegedly needed them to reduce his income
taxes.  Even assuming this to be true,
we do not think that made the said payments fictitious, especially so since the
petitioner never denied having received them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other issue raised by the petitioner, which is decidedly
legal, is easily resolved.  There being
no tenancy relationship, the contention that the private respondent's complaint
has prescribed under Section 38 of R.A. 3844 must also fail.  That section is not applicable.  It must be noted that at the very outset,
Alzona rejected the petitioner's claim of agricultural tenancy and immediately
instituted his action for unlawful detainer in accordance with Section 1, Rule
70 of the Rules of Court.  As it
happened, the said case was held not proper for trial by the Ministry of
Agrarian Reform.  He then resorted to
other remedies just so he could recover possession of his land and, finally, in
1979, he yielded to the jurisdiction of the defunct Court of Agrarian Relations
by filing there an action for declaration of non-tenancy.  The action, which was commenced in 1979, was
within the ten-year prescriptive period provided under Article 1144 of the
Civil Code for actions based on a written contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court quotes with approval the following acute observations
made<i> </i>by Justice Alicia Sempio-Diy:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It might not be amiss to state at this juncture that in deciding
this case in favor of defendant, the lower court might have been greatly
influenced by the fact that defendant is a mere farmer who is almost illiterate
while plaintiff is an educated landlord, such that it had felt that it was its
duty to be vigilant for the protection of defendant's interests.  But the duty of the court to protect the
weak and the underprivileged should not be carried out to such an extent as to
deny justice to the landowner whenever truth and justice happen to be on his
side.  Besides, defendant’s economic
position <u>vis a vis</u> the plaintiff does not necessarily make him the
underprivileged party in this case, for as testified by plaintiff which
defendant never denied, the small land in question was the only landholding of
plaintiff when he and his father bought the same, at which time he was just a
lowly employee who did not even have a house of his own and his father, a mere
farmer, while defendant was the agricultural tenant of another piece of land
and also owns his own house, a <u>sari</u> <u>sari</u> store, and a <u>caritela</u>.  Plaintiff also surmised that it was only
after defendant had been taken into its wings by the Federation of Free Farmers
that he started claiming to be plaintiff's agricultural tenant, presumably upon
the Federation's instigation and advice.  And we cannot discount this possibility indeed, considering that during
the early stages of the proceedings in this case, defendant even
counter-proposed to plaintiff that he would surrender the land in question to
the latter if plaintiff would convey to him another piece of land adjacent to
the land in question, almost one ha. in area, that plaintiff had also acquired
after buying the land in question, showing that defendant was not as ignorant
as he would want the Court to believe and had the advice of people
knowledgeable on agrarian matters.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court has stressed more than once that social justice - or
any justice for that matter - is for the deserving, whether he be a millionaire
in his mansion or a pauper in his hovel.  It is true that, in case of reasonable doubt, we are called upon to tilt
the balance in favor of the poor, to whom the Constitution fittingly extends
its sympathy and compassion.  But never
is it justified to prefer the poor simply because they are poor, or to reject
the rich simply because they are rich, for justice must always be served, for
poor and rich alike, according to the mandate of the law.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
