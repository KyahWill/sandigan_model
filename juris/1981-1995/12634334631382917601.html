				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On March 17, 1986, at about 9:30 o'clock in the evening, Pat.
Hector Colmo and his girl friend, Fe Nisperos, were sitting at one end of a
bench in a shed located at the Food Terminal Compound in Bicutan, Taguig,
Rizal.  They were waiting for a ride
home.  Seated at the other end of the
bench were three men who were talking among themselves.  Nisperos was looking at the approaching bus
they were to take when suddenly she heard a shot that made her scamper in
fright.  She realized seconds later that
she had left her boy friend behind, and so she turned back.  She froze in horror.  Colmo was slumped on the ground with a
bleeding head.  She rushed to aid him,
but one of the three men jumped over the bench and pointed a gun at her.  She stopped short.  He took the pistol from the fallen victim.  She looked at the man but he did not harm
her or even speak to her.  As he fled
with his<i> </i>two companions, she started shouting for help.  Some people succored her but it was<b> </b>too
late.  Colmo expired from
"cardio-respiratory arrest due to shock and hemorrhage as a result of the
gunshot wound in the head."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Danilo Manansala was in due time picked up and investigated for
the offense.  Subsequently, he was
charged with the crime of robbery with homicide committed in conspiracy with
two unidentified persons and with the aggravating circumstances of evident
premeditation and treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.  He was also required to pay the victim's
heirs P30,000.00 as civil indemnity for his death; P50,000.00 for loss of his
earning capacity; P20,000.00 as moral; and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages, as
well as the costs of the suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant is now before us to challenge his
conviction.  He faults the trial court
for giving undue credence to the evidence of the prosecution and for disbelieving
his defense as bolstered by the constitutional presumption of innocence in his
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal witness for the prosecution was Fe Nisperos, who
testified on the details of Colmo's shooting as above narrated.  The defense now questions her credibility
and claims that when she was taken to the detention cell and later to the
fiscal's office to identify Manansala, she hesitated and could not readily
point to him as the assailant.  In
short, her subsequent identification of the accused-appellant at the trial was<b>
</b>not positive enough or credible enough to dispel the doubt that should have
been resolved in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is not acceptable.  Nisperos was quite definite when she testified that it was<b> </b>the
accused-appellant whom she saw clearly by the several lights in the FTI
compound as he aimed his gun at her and took the pistol from the dying
Colmo.  Thus she said in no uncertain
terms:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  When you were approaching your boy friend, did you take a good
look at the gunman when he came near you and took the gun of your boy friend?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, even if it be supposed that she had hesitated when she
identified Manansala to the police investigators, such hesitation would not
necessarily vitiate her credibility.  After all, more than five months had elapsed when she was taken to the
detention cell and then to the fiscal's office to pinpoint Manansala from
several other persons.  It was necessary
for her to think back on the night when her fiance died before her eyes and to
focus once again on her remembrance of the face of the man who had confronted
her then.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Manansala testified that at the time of the
incident in question, he was not in Bicutan but in Caloocan City.  At eight o'clock that evening, he was in the
house of Fely Bodomo with his father, his stepmother and his brothers and
sisters.  At ten o'clock, he went to
sleep.  He stated categorically that he
did not leave the house from that hour until he awoke between 5 and 6 o'clock
the following morning.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the many companions he had at that time, only one of them
was presented to corroborate his testimony, namely, Bienvenida Bodomo
Manansala.  This witness testified that
at the time of the shooting in Bicutan, the accused-appellant was in her
sister-in-law's house, which was<span style=""> </span>near
her own house.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Curiously, this sister-in-law, who <span style="">was </span>in
the best position to affirm this statement, was<span style=""> </span>not called to the stand.  Bienvenida added that Manansala returned home at 10 o'clock that night
and went to bed, where he stayed until morning.  Yet she herself, as she also said under oath, retired at 9:30
o'clock that evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
She therefore could not have known of Manansala's return a half-hour later,
when she was already asleep.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is an inherently weak defense.  And it becomes more so in the case at bar not only because of the
positive identification of the accused-appellant by eyewitness Nisperos.  No less importantly, the testimonies of the
accused-appellant and of his lone corroborating witness are themselves so
conspicuously flawed as to invite rejection.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense makes much of the fact that after the shooting of
Colmo, Manansala changed his residence from Caloocan City to Bicutan.  The suggestion is that he would not have
done this if he were really guilty as he would be exposing himself to the
danger of being recognized by the witnesses to the shooting and robbery.  It is true that "the wicked flee when
no man pursueth but the righteous are as bold as a lion," as the defense
points out.  The circumstances of this
case, however, do not indicate that Manansala dared to be in Bicutan because of
his "righteousness," as it appears that he had other reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noted, to begin with, that Manansala did not really
transfer but in fact returned to Bicutan, where he had grown up and was more
"at home." Secondly, it was convenient for him to be in this place
because it was in Bicutan where he was working; indeed, he said he was picked
up there when he was walking to his place of work.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
A third reason may be that he did not feel his presence in Bicutan would be
dangerous to him, considering that none of the persons who had actually seen
the shooting incident months before had dared to come forward and denounce him
or his companions.  Rightly or wrongly,
Manansala did not feel threatened because he was in his own turf, so to speak.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was not necessary to pinpoint Manansala as the person who
actually shot Colmo because it has been established that Manansala acted in concert
with his two companions in killing and robbing their victim.  The culprits evidently knew Colmo to be a
policeman (although he was in civilian clothes at the time) and killed him
because of the firearm he was carrying.  In a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all, and every
co-conspirator is equally liable for the offense committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, even if it was not Manansala but one of his co-conspirators who fired
the gun that killed Colmo, Manansala would still be subject to the penalty
imposed by the Revised Penal Code for the crime they had all committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing was aggravated by treachery as the victim was shot
from behind.  Dr. Desiderio Moraleda,
who performed the autopsy on the cadaver, testified that the fatal bullet
entered the back of Colmo's head and passed through his mouth.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
"There is <u>alevosia</u> when the offender commits any of the crimes
against the person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof
which tend directly and especially to insure its execution, without risk to
himself arising from any defense which the offended party might make."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Colmo never knew what hit him and was totally unprepared for the attack that
caused his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evident premeditation is not inherent in robbery with homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In such an offense, the evident premeditation must relate to the killing and
not to the robbery.  According to Chief
Justice Ramon C. Aquino:</p>

<blockquote>Under normal conditions, where conspiracy is directly established,
with proof of the attendant deliberation and selection of the method, time and
means of executing the crime, the existence of evident premeditation can be
taken for granted.  But in the case of
implied conspiracy, evident premeditation may not be appreciated, in the
absence of proof as to how and when the plan to kill the victim was hatched or
what time elapsed before it was carried out, so that it cannot be determined if<i>
</i>the accused had "sufficient time between its inception and its
fulfillment dispassionately to consider and accept the consequences."
There should be a<i> </i>showing that the accused had the opportunity for
reflection and persisted in effectuating his criminal design.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Such a showing being absent in the case at bar, this aggravating
circumstance should be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the guilt of the accused-appellant has been clearly
established and that the penalties imposed upon him, save for the civil
indemnity, are in accordance with law.  The evidence of the prosecution was strong enough to overcome the
constitutional presumption of innocence.  The defense has failed to refute that evidence.  Hence, the accused-appellant must remain in
prison for the rest of his life unless age or sincere remorse unfastens his
bonds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is DISMISSED and the challenged
decision AFFIRMED except for the <span style="">civil </span>indemnity
which is increased to P50,000.00, with Costs against the
accused-appellant.  It is so ordered.</p>
