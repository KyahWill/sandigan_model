on <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1970</st1:date> and an
unqualified plea of guilt was entered. The next day, <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1970</st1:date>, the court rendered its
judgment, the dispositive part of which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommended the affirmation of the
decision, and refuted the allegations of the defendant-appellant, but said
recommendation is negated by the facts that actually transpired during the
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Records show that soon after defendant-appellant was apprehended
on <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1970</st1:date>, his
arraignment was scheduled before the Criminal Circuit Court of San Fernando, La
Union, presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Añover</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Altogether, this case was actually set and rescheduled for six
(6) times, first of which was on <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="8">August

Rivera moved to withdraw as <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> counsel and it was

 8, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, for failure
of the <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> and <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>

for the next day and the court appointed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cariaso</span> <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> counsel for the
accused. On the third hearing date, neither the <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>

of fear of his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> <span class="SpellE">Magsi</span>

Atty. Rivera and accused were hardly afforded by the Court any opportunity to
discuss the case together, and the qualified plea of guilty resulted from the
Court's <span class="SpellE">proddings</span> rather than from <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> spontaneous volition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the second instance, the Court knew that <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
prior plea of guilty was qualified by alleged duress employed on him by the
other accused. It behooved the Court to allow the accused an opportunity to
present evidence on the alleged duress, as well as discover for itself the

<p class="BODY">But more importantly, the Court could have complied, as it failed
to do so the first time, with its bounden duty to apprise and advise the
accused of the seriousness of the charges, the meaning of the qualifying and
modifying circumstances, and gravity of the penalty that may be imposed on him
despite the plea of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">guilty, as well as
received prosecution's evidence on the alleged aggravating circumstances
attendant to the commission of the offense charged. But these considera­tions
notwithstanding, <u>sans</u> any evidence <span class="GramE">whatsoever from</span>
the prosecution nor from the defense, after Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cariaso's</span>

December 21, 1907 in U.S. vs. Rota, et al. (9 Phil. 426, 431) wherein this
Court added that ‘in all cases, and especially in cases where the punishment to

<p class="BODY">Focusing attention on the trial court's duties to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>accused, <span class="GramE">We</span>
have again said in People vs. Domingo (55 SCRA 243-244):</p>

<blockquote>"WE enunciated times with­out number in Our injunctions
addressed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">the </span>trial courts
that they should exercise soli<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">citous
care before sentencing the accused on a plea of guilty especially in capital
offenses by first insuring that the accused fully understands the gravity of
the offense, the severity of the consequences attached thereto as well as the
meaning and significance of his plea of guilty; and that the prudent and proper
thing to do in capital cases is to take tes­timony, to assure the court that
the accused has not misunderstood the nature and effect of his plea of guilty
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Villafuerte</span>, <u>supra</u>; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Alamada</span>, L-34594-5, July 13, 1973; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Busa</span>, L-32047, June 25, 1973; People vs. Silvestre,

<p class="BODY">WE continued to stress lengthily the same injunctions in the case
of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span> (L-32752-3, Jan. 31, 1977, 75
SCRA 153-55):</p>

<blockquote>"To start with, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not even
ascertain for itself whether the accused com­pletely understood the precise
nature of the charge and the meaning of the aggravating circumstances of
nighttime, craft and abuse of superior strength as having attended the commis­sion
of the crime, so as to obviate any doubt as to the possibility <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">that </span>they have mis­understood the
nature and gravity of the charge to which they were pleading guilty. The trial
court did not conduct a dialogue with the accused on their educational
attainment, especially considering that a cursory perusal of their signatures
on the statements they gave to the <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> Police
Force (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. A, B and C) tends to show that they have
very little or scanty education. Moreover, from the transcript, <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>have noted that after the
arraignment, trial was held on three dates and on each day the accused were
assisted by three different counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>. In the hearing of
October 7, 197O -- the day the decision under review was rendered -- ­the
counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> who assisted the accused was de­signated by
the trial court only after the case was called <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
31.0pt">for </span>trial, i.e., after the accused had informed the trial court
that they did not have a lawyer. Under these circum­stances, it is not
unreasonable to assume that said counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> proceeded to
trial without first fully investigat­ing the facts of the case and that his
interview with the accused, even if it lasted for twenty (20) minutes as the
record insinuates, was not, and could not have been sufficient to enable him to
acquire a fairly good grasp, much less a comprehensive knowledge, of the
relevant facts of the case. Incidentally, under the Rules of this Court, whenever
an attorney <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is
</span>employed or assigned by the court to defend the accused at the trial, he
shall be given a reasonable time to consult with the accused and prepare his
defense before proceeding further in the case, which shall not be less than two
(2) days in case of trial (Sec. 5, Rule 116, Revised Rules of Court). The
record, incidentally, does not show the existence of a 'good cause' to justify
the trial court in shortening the trial fixed by the Rules.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of People vs. Regular (L-38674, Sept. 30,

<blockquote>"At the outset, it must be stated that the plea of guilty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">by the two accused were improvidently laid.
During the </span>arraignment, the trial judge did not adhere strictly to the

SCRA 798) where <span class="GramE">We</span> postulated the guideline in cases
where there is a plea of guilty by the accused. In the instant case under
review, <span class="GramE">We</span> observe that the trial judge failed to
explain fully to the two accused the meaning and the far-reaching effect of
their plea. It was not explained to them the meaning of the term ‘treachery,’
an aggravating circumstance which qualified the crime to murder and frustrated
murder respec­tively. Neither did the judge explain the terms 'evident pre­meditation'
and 'recidivism,' both aggravating circumstances alleged in the information
which had legal significance and consequences not ordinarily understandable to
a layman.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial judge asked the appellants whether they were aware
that the court had no other alternative except to impose the capital punishment
on them without explaining why it had to be so. In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

pleads guilty, he understands fully the mean­ing of his plea and the import of
