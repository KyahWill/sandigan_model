				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">JAIME CALIMQUIM was accused of rape in the defunct Municipal Court
of Sta. Barbara, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>. The verified complaint
was filed by Angel F. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, father of the
girl said to have been raped, and it reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That at about 8:00 P.M. of April 8, 1978, inside the public
market, in <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
Muni­cipality of Santa Barbara, Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honor­able Court, the
above-named accused, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and <span class="SpellE">feloneously</span> with lewd designs and by
means of intimidation, committed the crime of RAPE on the person of CORAZON DE
LOS REYES Y ANGUD, 14 years old and a physically retarded girl, in the
mezzanine of the accused, situated also at the public market, Sta. Barbara, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, until the latter had successful intercourse
with the victim, to the damage and prejudice of the undersigned, in such amount
as may be awarded under the provisions of the Civil Code of the Philippines.
Medical Certificate is hereto attached." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>, p. 1.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused waived preliminary investigation for which reason the
case was elevated to the defunct Court of First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
city where it was docketed as Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">D-1964.</span>
A plea of not guilty was entered by the accused on <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1978</st1:date>, and after a protracted trial
a decision dated <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1982</st1:date>,
was finally rendered with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused JAIME CALIMQUIM, alias
'<span class="SpellE">Enong</span>' <u>guilty</u> beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of <u>Rape</u>, and pursuant to law, hereby sentences him to suffer the
medium penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> (life
imprisonment), to indemnify the victim and aggrieved party, Corazon de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, in the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as moral damages, and to pay the costs." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 39.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before this Court on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This is a case of rape against a 14-year old girl who is
mute, and is, as found by the lower court, 'a physically, if not
mentally-retarded child.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The hapless victim, Corazon, is the youngest of five children
of the spouses Angel and Luz de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes. The couple
has a market stall inside the public market of Sta. Barbara, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> which the couple and their children use as
living quarters (TSN, July 6, 1979, pp. 33-36).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appellant, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Calimquim</span>, 30,
single at the time of the incident, operates a light and sound system for hire.
He also occasionally helps his mother, Maria <span class="SpellE">Calimquim</span>,
to tend to their stall which is also inside the public market of Sta. Barbara.
The stall of the <span class="SpellE">Calimquims</span> and that of the parents
of Corazon are about 8 meters apart. The <span class="SpellE">Calimquims</span>
also use their stall as living quarters (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Jan. 7,
1982, pp. 5-8).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Corazon was born mute. She can hear however. According to her
mother, Corazon communicates thru her actions (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
July 6, 1979, p. 35).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jaime has known Corazon since she was five year old. He used
to see her almost everyday from 1973 to 1978 in the market (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
March 31, 1982, p. 20). He describes her 'as somewhat crazy, she cannot speak,
and she uses her fingers when she talked and she always bends her head, (and)
is physically unbalanced' (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, March 31, 1982, p.
21).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Corazon has a playmate, Levy <span class="SpellE">Calimquim</span>,
an 8-year old niece of Jaime. They used to play in the latter's stall (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, March 31, 1982, p. 21).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1978</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening,
Corazon arrived home at the stall of her parents. She came from the stall of
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Calimquim</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, July
6, 1979, p. 44). She looked pale, sweating and frightened (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
July 6, 1979). She was trembling (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Oct. 10, 1979,
p. 4). There were blood spots on her panty (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, July
6, 1979, p. 38; Oct. 10, 1979, p. 4). Asked by her mother what happened,
Corazon lay down and made a demonstration with a forward and backward movement
of her hips. She pointed to her vagina with a push and pull motion (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, July 6, 1979, pp. 40-41).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While making a demonstration of what happened, Corazon was
pointing to the stall of Jaime. She cupped her breast with her hand and at the
same time made a push and pull move­ment of her hips (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
Oct. 10, 1979, p. 6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thinking at first that Corazon had menstrua­tion, her mother,
Luz de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes washed <span class="SpellE">Corazon's</span>
private parts. Corazon felt some pain. Asked again by her mother what really
happened, Corazon repeated with gyrations of her hips, at the same time
pointing to the stall of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Calimquim</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Oct. 10, 1979, p. 5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During all the time that Corazon was demonstrating what
happened to her, Jaime was standing near their stall observing (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, July 6, 1979, p. 38; Aug. 7, 1979, pp. 11-14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Luz then called for her husband to inform him about the
incident (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Oct. 10, 1979, p. 6). Together with
Corazon, they proceeded immediately to the house of barrio councilman Rodrigo
Bautista. The latter advised them to see a doctor to have Corazon examined (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Nov. 14, 1979, pp. 11-12). They then proceeded to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
Corazon was examined at <st1:time minute="25" hour="10">10:25 o'clock</st1:time>
that same evening, <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1978</st1:date>,
by Dr. Fatima De Leon. After examining Corazon, Dr. De Leon remarked: 'Brother,
this is rape and this is still fresh, so you try to file a case in court' (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Nov. 14, 1979, p. 13).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. De Leon issued a medico-legal cer­tificate, Exhibit A, as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April
 11, 1978</st1:date></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date>,
the incident was reported to the Sta. Barbara Police Department. Luz de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes gave a statement narrating the incident (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1). She also gave a
statement before the Municipal Judge of Sta. Barbara, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this appeal is the credibility of witnesses as
shown by the assignment of errors, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"I<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That</span> the guilt of the accused has not been proved beyond
reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“II. That the Trial Court erred in convicting the accused.” <span class="GramE">(Brief, p. 3.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the credibility of witnesses, well-settled is the rule that
the findings and conclusions of the trial court command great respect and
weight because it was in a better position to examine real evidence as well as
to observe the demeanor of witnesses while testifying in the case. Alas, the
rule can only be partially applied in this case because Judge <span class="SpellE">Willelmo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> who penned the
decision did not preside over the trial from the beginning to the end. Judge <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Orros</span>, Jr. tried the case
when the prosecution presented its evidence and then Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>
took over. For this reason, the record has been examined with more than the
usual care in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims that no rape was committed because of the
circumstances of many persons present at <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00
 P.M.</st1:time> in a public market. This claim is best refuted by Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> who had personal knowledge of the circumstances. He
said:</p>

<blockquote>“The defense tried to show the improbability of the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> having committed the crime charged, considering
that the other stalls near the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> stall were
still open at the time of its alleged com­mission, and there were still many
buyers or shoppers thereat and the stalls were even lighted with electric
bulbs. It is highly and inherently improbable that at <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 P.M.</st1:time> when accused raped Corazon, there were still
many buyers in the market. The Court can take judicial notice of the fact that
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 P.M.</st1:time>, provincial markets are
already deserted. Market vendors usually close their stalls as early as <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30</st1:time> or <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00
 P.M.</st1:time> Besides, the evidence disclosed that the rape victim, Corazon
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, is <u>mute</u> being a physically, if
not mentally-retarded child. She cannot speak or shout while being sexually
attacked and abused by accused. Accused very well know that condition of
Corazon de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, having, admittedly, known her
since the time she was only 5 years old. He, therefore, took advantage, knowing
she will not and can not raise an outcry, thereby precluding risk of detection
or discovery by the people in the market.” <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 37-38.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims that he did not rape Corazon; that she sustained
injuries in her genitalia because of her fall to the cement floor as she slid
down the bamboo balustrade of the stairs going to the mezzanine of his mother’s
stall when she played with Levy <span class="SpellE">Calimquim</span>; and she
was negative for spermatozoa.</p>

<p class="BODY">Corazon admittedly is not only a mute but also a retardate. But
when she was placed on the witness stand she was able to convey, albeit
vaguely, what happened to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Corazon testified through interpreters. Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quejado</span> was supplied by the prosecution. To check on
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Quejado</span>, the defense had Mr. Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Tagapia</span>. The qualifications of both interpreters were
scrutinized and found satisfactory.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fairness to the appellant, the testimony of Corazon on <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1979</st1:date>, is hereby
reproduced:</p>

went to the stall of the De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes family; they
asked forgiveness for what Jaime had done. Angel de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes, father of Corazon, just kept silent. (TSN, October 10, 1979.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Angel <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes, father of Corazon,
testified that he was watching television in the evening of April 8, 1978, when
he was told that his daughter had a problem. He went to the house of Councilor
Rodrigo Bautista where he saw his wife and Corazon. Bautista told him to take
Corazon to a doctor. Corazon was taken to <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
City where she was examined by Dr. de Leon. "After examining, she told me
Brother, this is rape and this is still fresh, so you try to file a case in
court." (TSN, November 14, 1979.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Angel <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes in fact filed a
criminal complaint for rape against Jaime <span class="SpellE">Calimquim</span>
on April 11, 1978, in the Municipal Court of Sta. Barbara, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Fatima de Leon identified Exhibit A, the medical certificate
which she issued after conducting an examination on Corazon de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes. She said that the laceration on <span class="SpellE">Corazon's</span> labia <span class="SpellE">majoria</span> measuring
5 cm. could have been caused by forcible contact with a blunt instrument and a
male organ is a blunt instrument. She also testified that <span class="SpellE">Corazon's</span>
vagina which admitted two fingers easily and the fresh laceration on her hymen
could have been caused by the penetration of the male genital organ. (TSN, May
25, 1979.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the appellant's mother sought forgiveness for her
son from <span class="SpellE">Corazon's</span> father is an indication of guilt.
(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Olmedollo</span>, L-42660, August 30, 1982,
116 SCRA 193.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's claim that <span class="SpellE">Corazon's</span>
lacerations on her genitalia were sustained when she fell on the cement floor
is too crude to be convincing. A fall would at best produce abrasions and
contusions but not <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> laceration and bleeding.
As to the bleeding, it could not have been due to menstruation. According to
Dr. de Leon, the word "menarche" in Exhibit A means "that the
patient has not menstruated yet."</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of spermatozoa in the vagina of Corazon when she was
examined by Dr. de Leon avails him not. For according to the same doctor,
spermatozoa cannot be detected after a few hours because they will have dried
up. Our jurisprudence tells us that the absence of spermatozoa in the vaginal
canal does not disprove the commission of the crime of rape where the essential
element is penetration, not emission. (People vs. Salazar, L-37791, October 30,
1979, 93 SCRA 796.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case is very similar to that of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, L-41819, February 28, 1979, 88 SCRA 704. In that
case, Therese <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> was the victim and she was the
only witness to the act of rape. She could not give a coherent, clear and
consistent narrative as to how she was ravished because she was mentally
retarded and speech-defective. The fact of rape was established mainly on the
testimony of Therese's mother and the physician who examined Therese. In the
words of the decision:</p>

<blockquote>"Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> recounted in court
how she came to know that Therese had sexual intercourse with Winston [<span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>]. On New Year's Day, January 1, 1973, while Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> was cleaning her house, she found two white pills
in the locker of Therese. When she queried her daughter as to the function of
the pills, Therese answered that the pills 'were for not having a baby' or were
contraceptive pills. Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> found out that her
daughter got the pills from Winston and that Therese had sexual intercourse
with him two times." (At p. 709.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are morally satisfied that the appellant committed the crime of
rape on Corazon, a mute and a mental retardate. The fact that Corazon could not
give a coherent narration of the rape does not detract from Our conclusion
considering that the record is replete with other evidence to support it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no error to have been committed by the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, its judgment is affirmed in <span class="SpellE">toto</span>.
Costs against the appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
