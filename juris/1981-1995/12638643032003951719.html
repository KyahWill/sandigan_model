reversal of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the July 30, 1986
decision of the Court of Appeals in AC-G.R. SP No. 09255 entitled “Metropolitan
Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> C. Mariano, et
al.” dis­missing Civil Case No. 85-33218 entitled “Fortune Motors (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.) Inc. v. Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust Co.” filed in
the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch IV for improper venue and (b) the
resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1986</st1:date>
denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of the case are as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 29, 1982 up to January 6, 1984, private respondent
Metropolitan Bank extended various loans to petitioner Fortune Motors in the
total sum of P32,500,000.00 (according to the borrower; or P34,150,000.00
according to the Bank) which loan was secured by a real estate mort­gage on the
Fortune building and lot in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 60-62)</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to financial difficulties and the onslaught of economic
recession, the petitioner was not able to pay the loan which became due.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 62)</p>

<p class="BODY">For failure of the petitioner to pay the loans, the respondent
bank initiated extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After notices were served, posted, and
published, the mortgaged property was sold at public auction for the price of
P47<span class="GramE">,899,264.91</span> to mortgagee Bank as the highest
bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 11)</p>

<p class="BODY">The sheriff's certificate of sale was registered on <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1984</st1:date> with the one-year
redemption period to expire on <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 12)</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 21, 1985, three days before the expiration of the
redemption period, petitioner Fortune Motors filed a complaint for annulment of
the extrajudicial foreclosure sale alleging that the foreclosure was premature
because its obligation to the Bank was not yet due, the publication of the
notice of sale was incomplete, there was no public auction, and the price for
which the property was sold was "shockingly low".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 60-68)</p>

<p class="BODY">Before summons could be served private respondent Bank filed a
motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the venue of the action was
improperly laid in Manila for the realty covered by the real estate mortgage is
sit­uated in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, therefore the action to annul
the foreclosure sale should be filed in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">rollo</span></span>, pp. 67-71-A)</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion was opposed by petitioner Fortune Motors alleging that
its action "is a personal action" and that "the issue is the
validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings" so that it may have
a new one year period to redeem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 72-73)</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 8, 1986 an order was issued by the lower court
reserving the resolution of the Bank's motion to dismiss until after the trial
on the merits as the grounds relied upon by the defendant were not clear and
indubitable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 81)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bank filed a motion for reconsideration of the order dated <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1986</st1:date> but it was denied by
the lower court in its order dated <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="5">May
 28, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "L" pp. 93-96; Annex "N"
p. 99)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1986</st1:date>
the respondent Bank filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in
the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "O" pp. 100-115)</p>

<p class="BODY">And on <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1986</st1:date>,
a decision was issued by the Court of Appeals, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that petitioner does not directly seek the
recovery of title or possession of the property in question, his action for
annulment of sale and his claim for damages are closely intertwined with the
issue of owner<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ship</span> of the
building which, under the law, is considered immovable property, the recovery
of which is petitioner's primary objective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

of a sale of real property does not operate to efface the fundamental and prime
objective and nature of the case, which is to recover said real property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a real action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court, therefore, did not err in
dismissing the case on the ground of improper venue (Sec. 2, Rule 4) which was

the Court of Appeals in a decision penned by then Court of Appeals Associate
Justice now Associate Justice <span class="GramE">of</span> the Supreme Court

reads: "Since an extra­judicial foreclosure of real property results in a
