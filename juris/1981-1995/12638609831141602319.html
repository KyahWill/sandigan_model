issue in this special civil action for <i><u>certiorari</u>.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Offshore Industries, Inc. is a business firm engaged
in <span class="SpellE">lighterage</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent Alfredo F. Osorio had been an employee of the
petitioner since 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of
his dismissal in 1987, the private respondent was the barge master of Barge
10002.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>December 1986, the <span class="SpellE">Vill</span> Integrated Transport Corporation chartered two barges
owned by the petitioner, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., Barge 10002 and another barge, the
Masuda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The chartered vessels were to
transport bags of sugar from Port <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charter agreement provides, among others,
that the conditions recited in the Uniform Time Charter adopted in the Baltic and
International Maritime Conference shall be incorporated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1986</st1:date>,
both barges were completely loaded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Barge Masuda was loaded with 14,000 bags of sugar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Barge 10002 was loaded
with 19,000 bags of the said commodity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The two barges set out to leave the port despite the rough sea and the
high winds that day.</p>

<p class="BODY">On its way out of the port, Barge 10002 ran aground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A tugboat tried to pull the barge but it did
not succeed in doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On account of
the incident, the cargo of Barge 10002 had to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">transferred </span>to another barge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner incurred expenses as a result of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter addressed to the petitioner, the <span class="SpellE">Vill</span>
Integrated Transport Corporation reported the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the letter took note of the rough
sea and the high winds when the two barges set out to leave the port, the
unfortunate incident was nonetheless attributed to the negligence of the crew
of Barge 10002, particularly the failure of the private respondent, as barge
master, to release the anchor of the barge upon the signal of the <span class="SpellE">tugmaster</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
support of this contention, it was also pointed out that no untoward incident
came upon Barge Masuda on the same occasion because her crew released the
anchor of the said barge at the proper time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also alleged in the letter that the <span class="SpellE">Vill</span>
Integrated Transport Corporation lost eleven bags of sugar during an earlier
voyage of Barge 10002 on account of the negligence of its barge master, the
herein private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1987</st1:date>,
the private respondent was replaced as barge master.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="1">January
 24, 1987</st1:date>, his employment was terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the petitioner did not
conduct a thorough investigation of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1987</st1:date>,
the private respondent filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal against the
petitioner and the company president with the National Labor Relations
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent also
sought the payment of overtime pay, night shift differential pay, premium pay
for holiday <span class="GramE">and</span> rest day, as well as service incentive
leave pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">parties </span>submitted
their respective position papers and other pertinent pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contended that the company conducted some
inquiries regarding the incident and that it was eventually ascertained that
the private respondent was indeed negligent on account of his failure to
release the anchor of the barge at the appropriate time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner added that the negligence of
the private respondent should not be ignored considering that as barge <span class="GramE">master,</span> he was expected to exercise extreme care and
diligence in the performance of his duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also contended that the private respondent was
already warned in the past that a repetition of his negligent behavior during
an earlier voyage of Barge 10002 where the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
lost eleven bags of sugar will result in his dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">sum,
</span>the petitioner contended that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">dismissal
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>the private
respondent was justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
likewise maintained that the money claims of the private respondent had already
been paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of the allegation,
the petitioner submitted a personnel change memo and a check voucher.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, the private respondent contended that the incident
was not due to negligence attributable to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He imputed the same to the overloading of Barge 10002 and the low
tide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also pointed out that the
Masuda was able to negotiate the exit from Port <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
despite the rough sea and the high winds because it was 5,000 bags of sugar
lighter than Barge <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">10002 </span>and that
the big difference in weight<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>hampered
the maneuverability of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent also invoked paragraphs 8 and 9 of the
Uniform Time Charter which provide that the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
is liable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">for damages </span>incurred
due to the overloading of the barge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
private respondent likewise alleged that his summary dismissal was arbitrary in
character and was in violation of his right to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">due </span>process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He averred
that the petitioner has yet to pay his money claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>Decision dated
<st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1987</st1:date>, the
labor arbiter assigned to the case ruled in favor of the private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions of
the said Decision are as follows --</p>

<blockquote>"We are not impressed with the contention of complainant for
it clearly appears that the incident was due to his failure to exercise
necessary precaution and prompt action relative to the loading of sugar on his
barge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Be that as it may, however, we find the penalty of dismissal
imposed on complainant as harsh and excessive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A penalty of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">two </span>or
three <span class="GramE">months</span> suspension would be more reasonable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With regard to the claim for overtime pay, no amplification
was made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, the same will fail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the claim for holiday pay and service incentive pay,
suffice to say that respondent failed to present evidence of payment of the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption therefore, that
necessarily follows is that there really was no payment made.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the
respondent company to reinstate complainant to his former or equivalent
position and to pay him <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> effective <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="5">1 May 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the respondent is ordered to pay
complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">legal </span>holiday <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pay </span>and service incentive leave pay for
the last three years."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner brought an appeal to the National Labor Relations
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a Decision promulgated on
<st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1988</st1:date>, the
majority of the members of the Fifth Division <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

ruled that the private respondent was arbitrarily dismissed considering that he
was never given the opportunity to be heard as mandated by the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the respondent Commission held that the
reinstatement of the private respondent was proper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The respondent Commission
was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">also </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the view that the private respondent </span>may
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not be considered negligent inasmuch as
the charges against him were not substantiated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The pertinent portions of the said Decision are as follows --<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"However, we do not concur with the conclusion of the Labor
Arbiter that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">complainant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> </span>was to be blamed for the overloading and
for the late release of the anchor for the simple reason that no evidence was
adduced thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> par. 9 of the Uniform Time Charter, the loading
of the ship appears to be under the control of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged late <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">release </span>of the anchor by the crew under complainant-<span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> command was not shown to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">be </span>his fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
merely an opinion of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> as stated in his
letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in its letter, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> acknowledged the high seas and heavy wind at the
port's entrance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no basis
therefore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>the Labor
Arbiter's finding that the barge patron merited suspension for three (3)
months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
awarded should thus be from <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="1">January

<blockquote>"Considering respondent-appellant's failure to produce the
payrolls that complainant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was paid holiday
pay and service incentive leave pay, we affirm the awards in favor of
complainant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

the barge is the responsibility of the barge master in the same way that a
captain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>responsible for his
ship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also stressed that while the
private respondent should not be totally exonerated from any liability, his
dismissal under the circumstances <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>too
harsh.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his opinion, the private
respondent should be reinstated without the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant Petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner maintains that the position of barge master is a
very sensitive position and that the negligence of the private respondent
justifies his dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
adds that the reinstatement of the private respondent will be extremely
detrimental to its interest inasmuch as there will always be uncertainty and
anxiety on the part of the petitioner <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> the
private respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is in </span>charge
of a barge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">likewise </span>pleads
that the overloading of the barge could have been avoided if the private
respondent was attentive to his duties and prerogatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It pointed out that the private respondent
could have stopped further loading of the bags of sugar when the barge had
already exceeded its maximum capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the petitioner prays for the annulment of the questioned
Decision, as well as other equitable <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

contention of the petitioner to the contrary is an unsubstantiated
allegation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Court is convinced
that the dismissal of the private respondent was in violation of his right to
due process and that, accordingly, his reinstatement is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the petitioner failed to show that the dismissal of the
private respondent is for just cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The burden of proof in termination cases rests upon the employer to show
that the dismissal is for just cause and the failure to do so means that the dismissal
is not justified and the employee is entitled to reinstatement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">As to the issue regarding the propriety of the awards in favor of
the private respondent, the petitioner failed to substantiate its allegation
that the private respondent had already been paid his money claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The personnel change memo and check voucher
relied upon by the petitioner are not sufficient evidence of payment of the
financial benefits to which the private respondent was entitled during the
entire period of his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Actual
receipts signed by the private respondent, if any, would have been more
appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof rests

Since the petitioner failed to prove its assertion that the money claims of the
private respondent had already been paid, the respondent Commission correctly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">resolved the matter in favor of </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">private </span>respondent.</p>
