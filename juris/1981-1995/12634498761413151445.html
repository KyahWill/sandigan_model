"Flora L. <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> vs. Angel <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>")
dismissing the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit against a tenant filed
by a landowner who wanted to convert her land into a residential sub­division,
but denying to the tenant the right of re­demption, premised upon the
retroactive application of Presidential Decrees Nos. 27 and 316.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The antecedents of the
case disclose that since 1912, petitioner Angel <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
was the share tenant over two (2) parcels of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>
(Lots Nos. 1242 and 6) covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 74177 and
74161, with corresponding areas of 19,841 and 14,984 square meters,
respectively, both located at barrio <span class="SpellE">Salacot</span>, San
Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The front portion of </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> No.
1242, stretching along the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">National Highway</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">, became a residential area since the
Japanese Occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner,
however, continued to possess as tenant, the rear and greater portion of this
lot and Lot No. 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He became an
agricultural lessee during the agri­cultural year 1968-69.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The two lots were originally owned by <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>, who transferred ownership to <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> B. Calderon before the Japanese Occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="3">6
 March 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> Calderon sold the two
parcels of land to private respond­ent Flora L. <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
for P4<span class="GramE">,608.32</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the new owner, private respondent caused the cancellation of the
former titles and the issuance in her name of Transfer Certi­ficate of Title
No. 108665 <span style="">in lieu </span>of <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. 74161, and Transfer Certificate of Title No. 108666
to replace <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. 74177.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Six </span>months
later, or on 26 September 1969, private respondent caused the subdivision of
Lot No. 1242 covered by <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. 108666 into ten (10)
lots comprising Lots Nos. 1242-A to 1242-J and the issuance of <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> Nos. 117623 to 117632, all derived from <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. 108666.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lots
1242-A to 1242-I, with approximately 300 square meters each, occupy the portion
of the land­holding fronting the national road which had since become a
residential area and for which <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> Nos. 117623 to
117631 were issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tenth lot, Lot
No. 1242-J, with an area of 17,121 square meters, covered by <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. 117632, corresponds to the rear portion of the land­holdings
over which petitioner continued with his possession and tenancy.</p>

<p class="BODY">To pursue her plan to convert the entire landholding into
residential lots, private respondent in­stituted on <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="12">24 December 1969</st1:date> a Complaint for <span class="SpellE">Ejectment</span> against petitioner before the Court of Agrarian
Relations, 5th Regional District, Branch I-A, <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Complaint substantially alleged that the portions being tenanted by petitioner
(defendant therein) particular­ly, Lot 1242-J covered by <span class="SpellE">TCT</span>
No. 117632, with an area <span style="">of 17,121
square meters (derived from <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. 108666), and the
lot covered by <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. </span>108665 with <span style="">an area of 14,984 square meters, or a
combined area of approximate­ly 3.2 hectares, are all suited for subdivision
into residential lots, and thus sought the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of peti­tioner from the entire landholdings tenanted by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lots </span><span style="">Nos. </span><span style="">1242-A to 1242-I, or the residential lots, were already excluded from
the Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Answering, petitioner
interposed the special and affirmative defenses that the two (2) parcels of
land in question were sold by the former landowner, <span class="SpellE">Salud</span>
B. Calderon, to private respondent without complying with the notice
requirement of Section 11 of Republic Act No. 3844 (the Agricultural Land
Reform Code); that these lots were registered in violation of Section 13 of the
same law, which requires the vendor, as a pre-requisite to registration, to
execute an affidavit that he has given written notice pursuant to Section 11
thereof, or that the land is not cultivated by an agricultural lessee; that
private respondent filed this action without giving petitioner the required
notice under Section 36 of the same Code; that the landholdings in question are
not suitable for <span class="SpellE">homesite</span>, and that the attempt to
dispossess him was in bad faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By way of counterclaim, petitioner tendered and deposited with
the Court of Agrarian Relations the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
to cover the purchase price of P4,608.32, in the exercise of his right of
redemption under Section <span style="">12 of the
Agrarian Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pending final determination of the case, petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="1">26 January 1970</st1:date> a "Motion for an
Interlocutory Order", followed about two weeks later with an Amended
Verified Motion, to direct private respondent to maintain petitioner in the
lawful possession and cultivation of the landholdings in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon hearing, petitioner testified and declared, <i style=""><span style="">inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></i><span style="">, </span>that on <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="2">27 February 1970</st1:date> private respondent had begun to bulldoze
the land resulting in the removal of the dikes and the destruction of rice
paddies; that roads had actually been constructed on the subject land, with
some gravel and sand already delivered; and that monuments were being planted
on the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also presented
in Court the Resolution of the Municipal Council of San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, dated 20 February 1970 (Exhibit "A"),
denying private respondent's application for conversion of the subject land
into a subdivision on the ground that the land was under the possession of a
tenant and there was a pending suit before the Court of Agrarian Relations
wherein said tenant was a party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower Court issued the interlocutory Order on <st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="3">5 March 1970</st1:date> enjoining private
respondent from com­mitting acts of dispossession against petitioner, or
otherwise from disturbing him in his possession and cultivation of these
landholdings pending the final determination of the case and until further
orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the Court <i>a quo</i><span style=""> </span>rendered its Decision on <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="8">20 August 1970</st1:date>, upholding <span style="">peti­tioner's </span>right to exercise
redemption but excluding the lots considered to have become residential
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the judgment reads:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon elevation of the
case to respondent Court of Appeals on 20 May 1971, docketed therein as CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 46454-R, private respondent stressed that the lower
Court committed three errors, <i>viz</i>.:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) in denying Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Esguerra's</span> Motion to
Intervene; (2) </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">or­dering private respondent to convey the
lands in ques­tion to the petitioner, contrary to Section 14 of Republic </span><span style="">Act </span><span style="">No. 3844; and (3) in issuing with grave abuse of discretion the Order
of 5 March 1970 restrain­ing private respondent and her agents from carrying
out her conversion plans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In disposing of the appeal, respondent Court observed that the
issues of fact and law can no longer be resolved in accordance with the law
then in force, and on the basis of the recorded evidence in view of the <i style="">status quo</i><span style=""> </span>provisions of Presidential Decrees <span style="">Nos. </span>27 and 316 and their implementing Rules and
Regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Premised on this theory,
respondent Appellate Court promulgated its Decision on <st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="10">22 October 1974</st1:date>, with the following <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the instant suit for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>

and it </span><span style="">is </span>hereby ordered
that the <span style="">redemption

court below be returned to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime, pending the promulgation of the rules and regula­tions implementing
Presidential Decree No. 27, the plaintiff and the defend­ant should maintain
the <i>status quo</i>, that <span style="">is, </span>the
leasehold relationship as landholder and agricultural lessee, the latter to
continue to <span style="">pay
</span><span style="">the </span><span style="">plaintiff lease
rentals under the leasehold arrangement existing as of October 21, </span>1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Motion for Reconsideration, praying that petitioner <span class="GramE">be</span> allowed <span style="">to </span>exercise
the right of redemption was denied by respondent Court in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="1">17 January 1975</st1:date>, but at the same
time, it ordered the denial to be</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">without</span>
prejudice to the right of the defendant to exercise the right of redemption,
should the National Development Authority, to be created by his Excellency, <span style="">find </span>that the land now in question is
not suitable for residential, commercial, industrial or non-­agricultural
purposes".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With leave of Court,
petitioner filed on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="2"><span style="">6 February 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> a second Motion for Reconsideration, which

<p class="BODY">About a year later, or on 10 August 1977, private respondent

respondent, to deliver or deposit in a reputable bonded warehouse the lease
rentals for the period commencing 1969 up to 1977, inclusive, corresponding to
the total yearly harvest of 510 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>, or the total

referring to the retroactivity of the Agricultural Land Reform Code, also a
social legislation aimed at making small farmers more independent, self-reliant
and re­sponsible citizens, with Mr. Justice Juvenal K. Guerrero as <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">ponente</span></i></span><span style="">, </span>this Court succinctly said:</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if applied retroactively, PD Nos. 27 and 316 will find

maintain the <i style="">status quo</i><span style=""> </span>or the leasehold relationship, as
ruled by respondent Court of Appeals, would prove more prejudicial to peti­tioner,
because by allowing him the right of redemption he becomes an independent owner
of the land, whereas, <span style="">if </span><span style="">the </span><i style="">status quo</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">is maintained he
becomes a perpetual agricultural lessee bound to pay rentals to the land­owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the fundamental policy
objectives of our agrarian laws, inclusive of PD 27 and 316, are achieved and
upheld by according to petitioner the right to redeem, a vested right which he
had acquired under the Code of Agrarian Reforms and of which he cannot be
deprived by subsequent legislation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

conditioned upon the fulfillment by the landowner of the following
requisites:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the property is

<blockquote><span style="">"Plaintiff filed </span>this
action for dispossession of defendant on the ground of conversion of the <span style="">properties in question into a </span>subdivision
on <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this time, the landholding <span style="">in ques­tion </span>was still agricultural <span class="SpellE"><span style="">rice</span>land</span> and
defendant was in possession thereof in the concept of agricul­tural
lessee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time also, it appears
that plaintiff had no approved plan of subdivision, she did not have the
approval of the Municipal Council of San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
to convert these properties into a subdivision and the construction had not
even been readied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the ninth
month of her ownership of the landholdings in question and barely three months
from the expiry date of the one-year period within which she had to convert the
land into a subdivision in accordance with Sec. 14, Republic Act No. 3844.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of the lack of plans and absence of <span style="">approval of authorities concerned and </span>during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this case, plain­tiff on February 27,
1970 <span style="">caused </span>the bulldozing of
defendant's landholdings, the construction of roads and gutters and the filling
of portions of the land with sand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
these facts show that there was no manifest intention on the part of plaintiff
to seriously convert the landholdings in question into a subdivision until she
was virtually forced to do so when defendant exercised his right to redeem the
properties through his counterclaim and the Muni­cipal Council of San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, disapproved her application for conversion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it may be added, plain­tiff's aborted and
vain conversion of the land beginning <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1969</st1:date> was an attempt to beat the deadline set by law within
which she had to convert the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's pretension that the construction had to be rushed because of
the need for the access road to the new parish church of <span class="SpellE">Salacot</span>
located in the property at the rear of the landholdings in question cannot be
given credence because there is no satisfactory evidence to <span style="">show </span>that in fact a parish church is
exist­ing or at least under construction and that plaintiff had actually
donated the access road to the parish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Besides, we </span>find
it strange that after donating the road bed plaintiff at her own<span style=""> ex</span>pense
should undertake the construction of the road itself and in the process
transform the <span class="SpellE">ricelands</span> in question into a
residential subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing
facts also reveal some measure of bad faith on the part of plaintiff in seeking
dispossession of defendant."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span class="SpellE">TEEHANKEE</span>, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur qualifiedly in the result, <span class="SpellE">i</span>.
e. the redemption of the land by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
from respondent purchaser <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> as ordered by the
Court of Agrarian Relations and which would be upheld in the Court's decision
which would also set aside the contrary decision <span style="">of </span>the Court of Appeals, may be enforced, if the contingencies
contemplated in the Court of Appeals' decision have materialized, <u>viz</u>.
the duly constituted authority yet to be created by the President of the
Philippines at that time has duly determined "that the land, now in
question, is <u>not</u> suitable for residential, commercial, industrial or non­-agricultural
purposes." Respondent should be given the oppor­tunity to show the
contrary, in which case redemption should not be allowed but under Section 36
of Republic Act No. 6389, the "agricultural lessee shall be entitled to
disturbance compensation equivalent to five years rental on his
landholding."</p>

<p class="BODY">This is but in accordance with the rationale and reser­vation
made in the Court of Appeals decision of <st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1974</st1:date> which I find proper and in order, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The questions of fact are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Does the evidence on record <span style="">sufficiently
</span>establish that the land <span style="">is
'suitably </span>located'?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was the
conversion subs­tantially carried out?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Was </span>the purchaser or the owner of the
land in good faith or in bad faith?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The determination of these issues of fact and law will
ultimately result in either the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the
defendant-tenant and the conversion, by the plaintiff, of the landholding in
question from one devoted to agricultural purposes into one for residential
purposes; or the defendant becoming the owner of the land by redemption or by
repurchase.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"We </span>believe,
however, that these questions can no longer be resolved in accordance with the
law then in force, and in accordance with the evidence on record, in view of
supervening Presidential mandate as contained in Presidential Decrees,
Instructions, and Proclamations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On October 21, 1972, President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued in
his own handwriting Presidential Decree No. 27, otherwise known as the
Emancipation Decree, mandating 'the emancipation of Tenant from the bondage of
the soil transferring to them the ownership of the land they till and providing
the instruments and mechanisms therefore.' On <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="11">Novem­ber 25, 1972</st1:date>, the President issued Memorandum No.
123-72 enunciating the guideline that 'no tenant will be ejected or removed
pending the promul­gation of the Rules and Regulations' for the implementation
of Presidential Decree No. 27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
implementing the ‘status quo' order of the Presi­dent, the Department of
Agrarian Reform issued on June 19, 1973, Memorandum Circular No. 2-A (Amended),
Series of 1973, stating that 'as of October 21, 1972, tenant-farmers are deemed
owners of the land they till, subject to the provisions of the rules and
regulations to be hereafter promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meantime, the leasehold system shall be provisionally maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tenant-farmer shall continue to pay the
landowner the lease rentals for the time being, which subject to the rules and
regulations aforementioned may be later credited <span style="">as </span>amortiza­tion payments.' The memorandum clarified that
'status quo shall mean maintaining the leasehold arrangement existing <span style="">as </span>of <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1972</st1:date>. '"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals
therefore properly rendered the follow­ing judgment:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the instant suit for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
is DISMISSED, and it is hereby ordered that the redemption money deposited by
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> with the court below be returned
to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, pending the
promulgations of the rules and regulations implementing Presidential Decree No.
27, the plaintiff and the defendant should maintain the status quo, that is,
the leasehold relationship as landholder and agricultural les­see, the latter
to continue to pay the plaintiff lease rentals under the leasehold arrangement
existing as of October 21, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In denying petitioner</span><span style="">'</span><span style="">s
motion for reconsideration of its decision, the Court of Appeals in its
extended Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January 17, 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> properly ruled as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The determination of whether or not a parcel of agricultural
land is suitable for residential purposes, while vested in the courts under the
Agricultural Land Reform Code, as amended, had, by this statement of policy, been
removed from the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not
the land is suitable for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes, can
be determined only by a national development authority created, or to be
created, by His Ex­cellency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
now have that authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> are </span>not now
in a position to determine whether or not the defendant may exer­cise the right
of redemption, as We do not now have the jurisdiction to determine the
suitability or non-suitability of the land now in question, for residential
purposes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED, but
without prejudice to the right of the defendant to exercise the right of
redemption, should the National Development Authority, to be created by His
Excellency, find that the land, now in question, is not suitable for
residential, commercial, industrial, or non-agricultural pur­poses."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I believe that with all
the more reason should both parties be given the fullest opportunity (as held
by the Court of Appeals) to enlighten the Court on this crucial matter of </span><u><span style="">whether or not</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
land was or has been found by the proper authorities to be <u>suitable for
residential or non-agricultural purposes</u>, since the Court's decision has
found correctly - contrary to the Court of Appeals' misimpression quoted
hereinabove - that Presidential Decree Nos. 27 and 316 are to be applied
prospectively, and not retroactively,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
therefore the payment of disturbance compensation by respondent to petitioner
as provided in Section 36 of the Republic Act 6389 would be applicable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, as noted on page 6 of the decision, petitioner <span class="SpellE">BaItazar</span> is already <span style="">88
</span>years of age and it has not been shown that he has direct descendants or
immediate relatives who would succeed him in the cultivation of the land sought
to be redeemed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally and more importantly, if the land in question was in fact
determined to be suitable for residential purposes and has in fact been
converted into a residential subdivision with­in the three-year period granted
by law, redemption would not be feasible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The spirit and letter of the <span style="">law as </span>embodied in Section 62 of the Code of
Agrarian Reform on Limitation on Land Rights<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
do not permit such redemption for speculation and profit-purposes by reselling
the subdivided residential lots - since the cited section permits that the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> may trans­fer or dispose of the <u>agrarian</u>
lot only until after the lapse of ten years and only "in favor of persons
qualified to acquire economic family size <u>farm</u> <u>units</u>." If
the land has indeed been found suitable or converted into residential lots,
then the payment of disturbance compensation as provided by the law then in
force and not redemption would be the relief properly due to petitioner.</p>
