<p class="BODY">It appears on record that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>
Sales Corporation (hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>)
whose president and general manager is <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>, is engaged in the business of selling construction
materials with principal office<span style=""> in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1978, the brothers <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Fernandez (hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Fernandezes</span>), both acting in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span>
Corporation, approached <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>
for credit accommodation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They requested
<span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>, thru <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Yao</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
to grant <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span> discounting privileges which <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> had with BA Finance Corporation (hereinafter referred
to as BA Finance).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Yao</span></st1:place></st1:city> apparently acquiesced, hence
on or about <st1:date year="1978" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1978</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Fernandezes</span> went to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Yao</span></st1:place></st1:city> for the purpose of discounting
<span class="SpellE">Sanshell's</span> post-dated check which was a BPI-<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch Check No. 499648 dated <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1979</st1:date> for the amount of
P60,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said check was payable
to <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Following the discounting process agreed upon, <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>,
thru <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Yao</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
endorsed the check in favor of BA Finance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, BA Finance issued a check payable to <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>
which endorsed it in favor of <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span> then made
use of and/or negotiated the check.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accompanying the exchange of checks was a Deed of Assignment executed by
<span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> in favor of BA Finance with the conformity of <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> was represented by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>, while <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span> was
represented by the Fernandez brothers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the said Deed, the subject of the discounting was the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> check (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
26-28).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the back thereof and of every
deed of assignment was the Continuing <span class="SpellE">Suretyship</span>
Agreement whereby the <span class="SpellE">Fernandezes</span> unconditionally
guaranteed to BA Finance the full, faithful and prompt payment and discharge of
any and all indebtedness of <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
36,46).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The BPI check, however, was
dishonored by the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank upon presentment for
payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BA Finance immediately reported
the matter to the <span class="SpellE">Fernandezes</span> who thereupon issued a
substitute check dated <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="2">February 19,
 1979</st1:date> for the same amount in favor of BA Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a Security Bank and Trust Company
check bearing the number 183157, which was again dishonored when it <span style="">was </span>presented for payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite repeated demands, <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Fernandezes</span>, failed to settle the obligation
with BA Finance, thus prompting the latter to institute <span style="">an action in court </span><span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.,
</span><span style="">p. 28).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Fernandezes</span>, despite having been served with summons and
copies of the complaint, failed to file their answer and were consequently
declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1980</st1:date>, the lower court ruled
in favor of BA Finance ordering them to pay the former jointly and severally,
the sum of P65,536.67 plus 14% interest per annum from <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1979</st1:date> and attorney's fees in the amount of
P3,000.00 as well as the costs of suit (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
51-52).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>,
however, moved to set aside the order of default, to have its answer admitted
and to be able to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prayer was granted through an order dated
<st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1980</st1:date>, wherein the
decision of the court was set aside only as regards <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial ensued once more until the court
reached a second decision <span style="">which states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is <span style="">hereby
</span>rendered in favor o<span style="">f </span>the

<blockquote>The cross-claim of defendant <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> Sales
Corporation against co-defendants Santiago B. Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
B. Fernandez is hereby denied, as there is no showing that <span class="SpellE">Nyco's</span>
Answer with cross-claim dated May 29, 1980 was ever received by said Fernandez
brothers, even as it is noted that the latter have not been declared in default
with respect to said cross-claim, nor were evidence adduced in connection
therewith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As to the would-be litigant <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span>
Construction and Development Corporation, defendant <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>
Sales Corporation did not properly <span class="SpellE">implead</span> said
corporation which should have been by way of a third-party complaint instead of
a mere cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
observations are noted as regard this cross-claim against <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span>
as those made with respect to the Fernandez brothers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal, </span>the
appellate court also upheld BA Finance but modified the lower court's decision
by ordering that the interest should run from <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1979</st1:date> until paid and not from <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nyco's</span> subsequent
motion for reconsideration was denied (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 33, 62).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crux of the controversy is whether or not the assignor is
liable to its assignee for its dishonored checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">For its defense, <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> anchors its
arguments on the following premises:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a)
that the appellate court erred in affirming its liability for the BPI check
despite a similar finding of liability for the SBTC check rendered by the same
lower court; b) that it was actually discharged of its liability over the SBTC
check when BA Finance failed to give it a notice of dishonor; c) that there was
<span class="SpellE">novation</span> when BA Finance accepted the SBTC check in
replacement of the BPI check; and d) that it cannot be held liable for its
President's unauthorized acts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>petition is
devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">An assignment of credit is the process of transferring the right
of the assignor to the assignee, who would then be allowed to proceed against
the debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be done either
gratuitously or onerously, in which case, the assignment has an effect similar
to that of a sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Article 1628 of the Civil Code, the assignor-vendor
warrants both the credit itself (its existence and legality) and the person of
the debtor (his solvency), if so stipulated, as in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, if there be any breach of the
above warranties, the assignor-vendor should be held answerable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no question then that the assignor-vendor is indeed liable for the invalidity
of whatever he assigned to<span style=""> </span>the
assignee-vendee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering now the facts of the case at <span style="">bar, it </span>is beyond dispute that<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> executed a deed of assignment in
favor of BA Finance with <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span> Corporation as the
debtor-obligor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BA <span style="">Finance </span><span style="">is </span>actually enforcing said deed and the check covered thereby is
merely an incidental or collateral matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This particular check merely evidenced the credit which was actually
assigned to BA Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
designation is immaterial as it could be any other check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the lower and the appellate courts
recognized this and so it is utterly misplaced to say that <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>
is being held liable for both the BPI and the SBTC checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only what is represented by the said
checks that <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> is being asked to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, nowhere in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
parts of the decisions of the courts can it be gleaned that BA Finance may
recover from the two checks.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nyco's</span> pretension that it had not been
notified of the fact of dishonor is belied not only by the formal demand letter
but also by the findings of the trial court that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yao</span> of <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> and the
Fernandez Brothers of <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span> had frequent contacts
before, during and after the dishonor (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, it fails to
realize that for as long as the credit remains outstanding, it shall continue
to be liable to BA Finance as its assignor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dishonor of an assigned check simply stresses its liability and the
failure to give a notice of dishonor will not discharge it from such
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because the cause of
action stems from the breach of the warranties embodied in the Deed of
Assignment, and not from the dishonoring of the check alone (See Art. 1628,
Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Novation</span> is the third defense set up by
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It insists that <span class="SpellE">novation</span> took place when BA
Finance accepted the SBTC check in replacement of the BPI check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is manifestly untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are only two ways which indicate the presence of <span class="SpellE">novation</span> and thereby produce the effect of extinguishing an
obligation by another which substitutes the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, <span class="SpellE">novation</span>
must be explicitly stated and declared in unequivocal terms as <span class="SpellE">novation</span> is never presumed (<span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>
v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 71889, April 17, 1990; <span class="SpellE">Caneda</span>, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 81322, February
5, 1990).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the old and the new
obligations must be incompatible on every point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test of incompatibility is whether or not
the two obligations can stand together, each one having its independent
existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they cannot, they are
incompatible and the latter obligation <span class="SpellE">novates</span> the
first (<span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> v. Intermediate Appellate Court, <u>supra</u>;
<span class="SpellE">Caneda</span>, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, there was no express
agreement that BA Finance's acceptance of the SBTC check will discharge <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> from liability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is there incompatibility because both checks were given
precisely to terminate a single obligation arising from <span class="SpellE">Nyco's</span>
sale of credit to BA Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">novation</span> speaks of two distinct obligations, such is
inapplicable to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> disowns its President's
acts claiming that it never authorized <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> (<span class="SpellE">Nyco's</span> President) to even
apply to BA Finance for credit accommodation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It supports its argument with the fact that it did not issue a Board
resolution giving <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Yao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the very
evidence on record readily belies <span class="SpellE">Nyco's</span>
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its corporate By-Laws
clearly provide for the powers of its President, which include, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, executing contracts and agreements, borrowing
money, signing, indorsing and delivering checks, all in behalf of the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the appellate
court correctly adopted the lower court's observation that there was already a
previous transaction of discounting of checks involving the same personalities
wherein any enabling resolution from <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nyco</span></span><span style=""> was </span>dispensed
with and yet BA Finance was able to collect from <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sanshell</span> was able to discharge its own
undertakings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such effectively places <span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> under <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pais</u></span> which arises when one, by his acts,
representations or admissions, or by his silence when he ought to speak out,
intentionally or through culpable negligence, induces another to believe
certain facts to exist and such other rightfully relies and acts on such
belief, so that he will be prejudiced if the former is permitted to deny the
existence of such facts (<span class="SpellE">Panay</span> Electric Co., Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 81939, June 29, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nyco</span> remained silent
in the course of the transaction and spoke out only later to escape
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cannot be
countenanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nyco</span>
is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from denying <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yao's</span> authority as far as the latter's transactions
with BA Finance are concerned.</p>
