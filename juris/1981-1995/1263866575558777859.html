executive departments of government stemmed from Senate Resolution No. 381,
adopted on <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="2">2 February 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<blockquote>"Authorizing and Directing the Committee on Finance to Bring

contesting the Constitutionality <span style="">of </span>the
Veto by the President of Special and General Provisions, particularly Section
55, of the General Appropriation Bill of 1989 (H.B No. 19186) and For Other
Purposes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners are thus before us as members and ex-officio members
of the Committee on Finance of the Senate and as "substantial taxpayers
whose vital interests may be affected by this case."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents are members of the Cabinet tasked with the
implementation <span style="">of </span>the General
Appropriations Act of 1989 and 1990, some of them incumbents, while others have
already been replaced, <span style="">and </span>include
the National Treasurer and the Commission on Audit Chairman, all of whom are
being sued in their <span style="">official </span>capacities.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u>The Background
Facts</u><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="12">16 December 1988</st1:date>,
Congress passed House Bill No. 19186, or the General Appropriations Bill for
the Fiscal Year 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As passed, it
eliminated or decreased certain items included in the proposed budget submitted
by the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the constitutional provision on the passage <span style="">of </span>bills, Congress presented the said
Bill to the President for consideration and approval.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="12">29 December 1988</st1:date>,
the President signed the <span style="">Bill </span>into
<span style="">law, and declared the same to have
become Rep. Act No. 6688.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
process, seven (7) Special Provisions and Section 55, </span>a <span style="">"General Provision," were vetoed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="2">2 February 1989</st1:date>,
the Senate, in the same Resolution No. 381 mentioned at the outset, further
expressed:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, Be
it Resolved, as it is hereby Resolved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the Senate express its sense that the veto by the President of
Section 55 of the GENERAL PROVISIONS of the General Appropriation Bill of 1989
(H.B. No. 19186) is unconstitutional and, therefore, void and without any force
and effect; hence, the aforesaid Section 55 remains;</blockquote>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus it is that, on <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="4">11
 April 1989</st1:date>, this Petition for Prohibition/<i>Mandamus</i> was
filed, with a prayer for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and
Restraining Order, assailing mainly the constitutionality or legality of the
Presidential veto of Section 55, and seeking to enjoin respondents from
implementing Rep. Act No. 6688.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
Restraining Order was issued by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Comment, submitted by the Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="8">25 August 1989</st1:date> (after several
extensions granted), was considered as the Answer to the Petition and, on <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="9">7 September 1989</st1:date>, the Court Resolved
to give due course to the Petition and to require the parties to submit their
respective Memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners filed
their Memorandum on <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="12">12 December 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, on 19 January 1990, they filed a Motion
for Leave to File and to Admit Supplemental Petition, which was granted,
basically raising the same issue as in the original Petition, this time
questioning the President's veto of certain provisions, particularly Section
16, of House Bill 26934, or the General Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year
1990, which the President declared to have become Rep. Act No. 6831.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General's Comment on the Supplemental Petition, on
behalf of respondent public officials, was submitted on <st1:date year="1990" day="24" month="4">24 April 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="5">15 May 1990</st1:date>, the
Court required the parties to file simultaneously their consolidated memoranda,
to include the Supplemental Petition, within an <span class="SpellE">inextendible</span>
period of thirty (30) days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, because the original Resolution of <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="5">15 May 1990</st1:date> merely required the filing of a
memorandum on the Supplemental Petition, a revised Resolution requiring
consolidated memoranda, within thirty (30) days from notice, was released on <st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="6">28 June 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Consolidated Memoranda were respectively filed on <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="6">26 June 1990</st1:date> by petitioners, and on <st1:date year="1990" day="1" month="8">1 August 1990</st1:date> by respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="8">14
 August 1990</st1:date>, both Memoranda were Noted and the case was deemed
submitted for deliberation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="11" month="9">11 September 1990</st1:date>,
the Court heard the case on oral argument and required the submittal of
supplemental Memoranda, the last of which was filed on <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="9">26 September 1990</st1:date>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u>The Vetoed
Provisions and Reasons <span class="SpellE">Therefor</span></u><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 55 of the Appropriations Act of 1989 (Section 55 [FY ‘89]
hereinafter), which was vetoed by the President, reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. 55. </span><u>Prohibition
Against the Restoration or Increase of Recommended Appropriations Disapproved
and/or Reduced by Congress</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No item
of appropriation recommended by <span style="">the
President in the Budget submitted to Congress pursuant to Article </span><span style="">VII, </span><span style="">Section 22 of the Constitution which has been disapproved or reduced in
this Act shall be restored or increased by the use of appropriations authorized
for other </span>purposes by augmentation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An item of <span style="">appropriation for any
purpose recommended by the </span>President in the Budget shall be deemed to
have been disapproved by Congress if no corresponding <span style="">appropriation for the specific purpose is provided in this Act."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We quote below the reason for the Presidential veto:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The provision violates Section 25(5) of Article VI of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If allowed, this Section
would nullify not only the constitutional and statutory authority of the
President, but also that of the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Heads of
Constitutional Commissions, to augment any item in the general appropriations
law for their respective offices from savings in other items of their
respective appropriations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful
review of the legislative action on the budget as submitted shows that in
almost all cases, the budgets of agencies as recommended by the President, as
well as those of the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the
Constitutional Commissions, have been reduced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An unwanted consequence of this provision is the inability of the
President, the President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the heads of
Constitutional Commissions to augment any item of appropriation of their
respective offices from savings in other items of their respective appropriations
even in cases of calamity or in the event of urgent need to accelerate the
implementation of essential public services and infrastructure projects.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, this provision is inconsistent with Section 12
and other similar provisions of this General Appropriations Act."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A substantially similar provision as the vetoed Section 55
appears in the Appropriations Act of 1990, this time <span style="">crafted as follows:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"B. GENERAL PROVISIONS</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Use of
Savings</u>. - The President of the Philippines, the President of the Senate,
the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, the Heads of Constitutional Commissions under Article IX of the
Constitution and the Ombudsman are hereby authorized to augment any item in
this Act for their respective offices from savings in other items of their
appropriations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PROVIDED, THAT NO ITEM
OF APPROPRIATION RECOMMENDED BY THE PRESIDENT IN THE BUDGET SUBMITTED TO
CONGRESS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE VII, SECTION 22 OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH HAS BEEN
DISAPPROVED OR REDUCED BY CONGRESS SHALL BE RESTORED OR INCREASED BY THE USE OF
APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZED FOR OTHER PURPOSES IN THIS ACT BY AUGMENTATION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AN ITEM OF APPROPRIATION FOR ANY PURPOSE
RECOMMENDED BY THE PRESIDENT IN THE BUDGET SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
DISAPPROVED BY CONGRESS IF NO CORRESPONDING APPROPRIATION FOR THE SPECIFIC
PURPOSE IS PROVIDED IN THIS ACT."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that in the 1989 Appropriations Act, the
"Use of Savings" appears in Section 12, separate and apart from
Section 55; whereas in the 1990 Appropriations Act, the "Use of
Savings" and the vetoed provision have been commingled in Section 16 only,
with the vetoed provision made to appear as a condition or restriction.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Essentially the same reason was given for the veto of Section 16
(FY ‘90), thus:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I am vetoing this provision for the reason <span style="">that it violates Section 25(5) of Article VI
of the Constitution in relation to Sections 44 and 45 of P.D. No. 1177 as
amended by R.A. No. 6670 which authorizes the President to use savings to
augment any item of appropriations in the Executive Branch of the Government.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Parenthetically,
there is a case pending in the Supreme Court relative to the validity of the
President's veto on Section 55 of the General Provisions of Republic Act No.
6688 upon which the amendment on this Section was based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inclusion, therefore, of the proviso in the
last sentence of this section might prejudice the Executive Branch's position
in the case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Moreover, if allowed,
this Section would nullify not only the constitutional and statutory authority
of the President, but also that of the officials enumerated under Section 25(5)
of Article VI of the Constitution, to augment any item in the general
appropriations law for their respective appropriations.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"An unwanted
consequence of this provision would be the inability of the President, the
President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court, and heads of Constitutional Commissions to
augment any item of appropriation of their respective offices from savings in
other items of their respective appropriations even in cases of national
emergency or in the event of urgent need to accelerate the implementation of
essential public services and infrastructure projects."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fundamental issue raised is whether or not the veto by the
President of Section 55 of the 1989 Appropriations Bill (Section 55 FY ‘89),
and subsequently of its counterpart Section 16 of the 1990 Appropriations Bill
(Section 16 FY ‘90), is unconstitutional and without effect.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u>The Contending
Views</u><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In essence, petitioners' cause is anchored on the following
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the President’s line-veto
power as regards appropriation bills is limited to item/s and does not cover <u>provision/s</u>;
therefore, she exceeded her authority when she vetoed Section 55 (FY ‘89) and
Section 16 (FY ‘90) which are <u>provisions</u>; (2) when the President objects
to a <u>provision</u> of an appropriation bill, she cannot exercise the
item-veto power but should veto the entire bill; (3) the item-veto power does
not carry with it the power to strike out conditions or restrictions for that
would be legislation, in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers; and
(4) the power of augmentation in Article VI, Section 25[5] of the 1987
Constitution, has to be provided for by law and, therefore, Congress is also
vested with the prerogative to impose restrictions on the exercise of that
power.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, as counsel <span style="">for </span>public respondents, counters that the issue at bar is a
political question beyond the power of this Court to determine; that
petitioners had a political remedy, which <span style="">was
</span>to override the veto; that Section 55 is a "rider" because it
is extraneous to the Appropriations Act and, therefore, merits the President's
veto; that the power of the President to augment items <span style="">in </span>the appropriations for the executive branches had already
been provided for in the Budget Law, specifically Sections 44 and 45 of <span style="">Pres. </span>Decree No. 1177, as amended <span style="">by </span>Rep. Act No. 6670 (4 August 1988);
and that the President is empowered by the Constitution to veto provisions or
other "distinct and severable parts" of an Appropriations Bill.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u>Judicial
Determination<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">With the Senate maintaining that the President's veto is
unconstitutional, and that charge being <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>,
there is an actual case or <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversy
between the Upper House of Congress and the executive department that may be
taken cognizance of by this Court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, where the legislature or the executive branch is
acting within the limits of its authority, the judiciary cannot and ought not
to interfere with the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But where
the legislature or the executive acts beyond the scope of its constitutional
powers, it becomes the duty of the judiciary, to declare what the other
branches of the government had assumed to do as void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the essence of judicial power
conferred by the Constitution ‘in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as
may be established by law’ [Art. VIII, Section 1 of the 1935 Constitution; Art.
X, Section 1 of the 1973 Constitution and which was adopted as part of the
Freedom Constitution, and Art. VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution] and
which power this Court has exercised in many instances" (<span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> vs. Alba, G. R. No. 71977, 27 February 1987, 148
SCRA 209).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We take note as well of what petitioners stress as the
"imperative need for a definitive ruling by this Court as to the exact
parameters of the exercise of the item-veto power of the President as regards
appropriation bills x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
in order to obviate the recurrence of a similar problem whenever a <span style="">general </span>appropriations bill is passed
by Congress." Indeed, the contextual reiteration of Section 55 (FY 89) in
Section 16 (FY ‘90) and again, its veto by the President, underscore the need
for judicial <span class="SpellE">arbitrament</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court does not thereby assert its
superiority over or exhibit lack of respect due the other co-ordinate
departments but discharges a solemn and sacred duty to determine essentially
the scope of intersecting powers in regard which the Executive and the Senate
are in dispute.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners have also brought this suit as taxpayers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Sanidad</span></u></span><u><span style=""> v. COMELEC</span></u> (No. L-44640, <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="10">12 October 1976</st1:date>, 73 SCRA 333), this
Court enjoys the open <span style="">discretion to </span>entertain
taxpayers suits or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span><u> v. </u><u><span style="">COMELEC</span></u><span style=""> (No. </span>L-34150,
<st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="10">16 October 1961</st1:date>, 41 SCRA
702), it was <span style="">also </span>held that a
member of the Senate has the requisite personality to bring <span style="">a </span>suit where a constitutional issue is
raised.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The political question doctrine neither interposed an obstacle to
judicial determination of the rival claims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The jurisdiction to delimit constitutional boundaries has been given to
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot abdicate that
obligation mandated by the 1987 Constitution, although said provision by no
means does away with the applicability of the principle in appropriate cases.</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The judicial power shall be vested in
one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to
settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and
enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any
branch or instrumentality of the Government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nor is this the first time that the constitutionality of a
Presidential veto is raised to the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two oft-cited cases are <span class="SpellE"><u>Bengson</u></span><u>
v. Secretary of Justice</u> (62 Phil. 912 [1936]), penned by Justice George A.
Malcolm, which upheld the veto questioned before it, but which decision was
reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the same entitled case in 292, U.S. 410, <u>infra</u>,
essentially on the ground that an Appropriations Bill was not involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second case is <span class="SpellE"><u>Bolinao</u></span><u>
Electronics v. Valencia</u> (G. R. No. L-20740, <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="6">30 June 1964</st1:date>, 11 SCRA 486), <u>infra</u>, which rejected
the President's veto of a condition or restriction in an Appropriations Bill.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u>The Extent of
the President's Item-veto Power<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The focal issue for resolution is whether or not the President
exceeded the item-veto power accorded by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or differently put, has the President the
power to veto "provisions" of an Appropriations <span style="">Bill?</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that Section 55 (FY '89) and Section 16 (FY
'90) are <u>provisions</u> and not <u>items</u> and are, therefore, outside the
scope of the item-veto power of the President.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The veto power of the President is expressed in Article VI,
Section 27 of the 1987 Constitution reading, in full, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 27. (1) Every bill passed by the Congress shall, before
it becomes a law, be presented to the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he approves the same, he shall sign it;
otherwise, he shall veto it and return the same with his objections to the
House where it originated, which shall enter the objections at large in its
Journal and proceed to reconsider it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of all the Members of such
House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the
objections, to the other House by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and
if approved by two-thirds of all the Members of that House, it shall become a
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all such cases, the votes of
each House shall be determined by <u>yeas</u> or <u>nays</u>, and the names of
the Members voting for or against shall be entered in its Journal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President shall communicate his veto of
any bill to the House where it originated within thirty days after the date of
receipt thereof; otherwise, it shall become a law as if he had signed it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2) The President shall have the power to veto any particular
item or items in an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill, but the veto shall
not affect the item or items to which he does not object."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph (1) refers to the general veto power of the President and
if exercised would result in the veto of the entire bill, as a general
rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph (2) is what <span style="">is </span>referred to as the item-veto power
or the line-veto power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It allows the
exercise of the veto over a particular item or items in an appropriation, revenue,
or tariff bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As specified, the
President may not veto less than all of an item of an Appropriations Bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the power given the executive
to disapprove any item or items in an Appropriations Bill does not grant the
authority to veto a part of an item and to approve the remaining portion of the
same item.</p>

<p class="BODY">Originally, item veto exclusively referred to veto of <u>items</u>
of appropriation bills and first came into being in the former Organic Act, the
Act of Congress of <st1:date year="1916" day="29" month="8">29 August 1916</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by the 1935 Constitution,
which contained a similar provision in its Section 11(2), Article VI, except
that the veto power was made more expansive by the inclusion of this sentence:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> When a
provision of an appropriation bill affects one or more items of the same, the
President can not veto the provision without at the same time vetoing the
particular item or items to which it relates x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The 1935 Constitution further broadened the President's veto
power to include the veto of item of items of revenue and tariff bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the advent of the 1973 Constitution, the section took a more
simple and compact form, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Section 20 (2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Prime
Minister shall have the power to veto any particular item or items in an

55 (FY '89) and Section 16 (FY '90) are such conditions/restrictions and thus
beyond the veto power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no denying that inherent in the power of
appropriation is the power to specify how money shall be spent; and that in
addition to distinct "items" of appropriation, the Legislature may
include in <span style="">Appropriation Bills
qualifications, conditions, limitations or restrictions on expenditure of
funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Settled also is the rule that the
Executive is not allowed to veto a condition or proviso of an appropriation,
while allowing the appropriation itself to stand (</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Fairfield</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> v. Foster, </span><u>supra</u>, at

an Appropriations Bill which did not include a veto of the items to which the
condition related was deemed invalid and </span>without effect whatsoever.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, for the rule to apply, restrictions should be such in
the real sense of the term, not some matters which are more properly dealt with
in a separate legislation (Henry v. Edwards, La, 346, So 2d 153).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Restrictions or conditions in an
Appropriations Bill must exhibit a connection with money <u>items</u> <u>in</u>
<u>a</u> <u>budgetary</u> <u>sense</u> in the schedule of expenditures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the test is appropriateness.</p>

<blockquote>"It is not enough that a provision be

with money items of appropriation that they logically belong in a schedule of
expenditures. . . <span style="">&nbsp;</span>the ultimate test is
one of appropriateness" (Henry v. Edwards, supra, at 158).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Tested by these criteria. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Section 55 (FY '89) <span style="">and </span>Section 16 (FY '90) must also be held to be <u>inappropriate</u>
<u>"conditions</u>." While<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>they,
particularly, Section 16 (FY '90), have been "artfully drafted" to
appear as true conditions or limitations, they are actually general law
measures more appropriate for substantive and, therefore, separate legislation.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, neither of them shows the necessary connection with a
schedule of expenditures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason, <span style="">as </span>explained earlier, <span style="">is </span>that items reduced or disapproved
by Congress would <span style="">not </span>appear on
the <span style="">face of </span>the enrolled bill <span style="">or </span>Appropriations Act itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They can only be detected when compared with
the original budgetary submittals of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Sections 55 (FY '89) and 16 (FY ‘90)
themselves provide that an item "shall be deemed to have been disapproved
by Congress if <u>no</u> <u>corresponding</u> <u>appropriation</u> <u><span style="">for</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>specific</u> <u>purpose</u> <u>is</u> <u>provided</u>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the vetoed provisions are not, in the budgetary sense
of the term, conditions or restrictions, the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Bolinao</u></span><u>
Electronics Corporation v. Valencia</u> (<u>supra</u>), invoked by petitioners,
becomes i<span style="">napplicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In that case, a public works bill

television stations, subject to the condition that the <span style="">amount </span>would not be available to places where there were
commercial television stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
President <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> approved the appropriation but

it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast with the case at bar,
there is no condition, in the budgetary sense of the term, attached to an appropriation
or item in the appropriation bill which was struck out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For obviously, Sections 55 (FY '89) and 16
(FY '90) partake more of a curtailment on the power to augment from savings; in

public funds and resources (<span class="SpellE"><u>Demetria</u></span><u> v.

separation of powers is in no way endangered because the transfer is made

<p class="BODY">When Sections 55 (FY ‘89) and 16 (FY ‘90), therefore, prohibit

<p class="BODY">More importantly, it strikes us, too, that for such a special
power as that of augmentation from savings, the same is merely incorporated <span style="">in </span>the General Appropriations

"one the primary and specific aim of which is to make a<span style="">pp</span>ropriation of money from the public

410, 57 <span class="SpellE">S.Ct</span>. 252).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a legislative authorization of receipts and expenditures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of augmentation from savings, on
the other hand, can by no means be considered a specific appropriation of
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a non-appropriation item
inserted in an appropriation measure.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same thing must be said of Section 55 (FY '89), taken in
conjunction with Section 12, and Section 16 (FY '90), which prohibit the
restoration or increase by augmentation of appropriations disapproved and or
reduced by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
non-appropriation items, an appropriation being a setting apart by law of a
certain sum from the public revenue for a specified purpose (<span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> v. Secretary of Justice, 62 Phil. 912, 916
[1936]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears repeating that they
are more of a substantive expression of a legislative objective to restrict the
power of augmentation granted to the President and other key officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are actually matters of general law and
more properly the subject of a separate <span style="">leg</span>islation
that will embody, define and delimit the scope of the special power of
augmentation from savings instead of being inappropriately incorporated
annually in the Appropriation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
sanction this practice would be to give the Legislature the freedom to grant or
withhold the power from the Executive and other officials, and thus put in
yearly jeopardy the exercise of that power.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If, indeed, by the later enactments of Section 55 (FY ‘89) and
Section 16 (FY '90), Congress, as petitioners argue, intended to amend or
repeal Pres. Decree No. 1177, with all the more reason should it have so
provided in a separate enactment, it being basic that implied repeals are not
favored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the same reason, we cannot
subscribe to petitioners' allegation that Pres. Decree No. 1177 has been
revoked by the 1987 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
1987 Constitution itself provides for the continuance of laws, decrees,
executive orders, proclamations, letters of instructions, and other executive
issuances not inconsistent with the Constitution until amended, repealed or
revoked (1987 Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">If, indeed, the legislature believed that the exercise of the
veto powers by the executive were unconstitutional, the remedy laid down by the

of Congress (1987 Constitution, Article VI, Section 27[1], <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>But Congress made no
attempt to override the Presidential veto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners' argument that the veto is ineffectual so that there is
"nothing to override" (citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Bolinao</u></span>)
has lost force and effect with the executive veto having been herein upheld.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Mme. Justice Herrera has written another opinion that commends
itself for its logic and lucidity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Regrettably, there are certain conclusions in the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span>
that I cannot share.</p>

<p class="BODY">In justifying her veto, the President says that "the
provision violates Section 25(5) of Article VI of the Constitution," as<span style=""> </span>if to suggest that she derives her
power of augmentation directly from this section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She does not, of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a self-executing provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said section states that she and the
other officials mentioned therein "may, <u>by law</u>, be authorized to
augment any item in the general appropriations law for their respective
offices..." This means she needs statutory authority before she can
augment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The President says nevertheless that she has that authority and
points to Section 44 of PD No. 1177, otherwise known as the Budget Reform
Decree of 1977, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, the provision she invokes is precisely the section
modified by Congress in the General Appropriations Act of 1989 (and also of
1990).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In vetoing Section 55 of that
law, the President is in effect saying that <span class="GramE">the</span>
authorization earlier given her cannot be revoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">The authority to augment is not such an extraordinary endowment
that, once given, becomes sacrosanct and irrevocable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Legislature has conferred in its
discretion, it can also recall in the exercise of that same discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only exception I know to the principle
that Congress cannot pass <span class="SpellE">irrepealable</span> laws is the
impairment clause, and even that is fast losing ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am not persuaded that Section 55 of the General Appropriations
Law of 1989 is a rider as contended by the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rider is a provision not germane to the
subject or purpose of the bill where it is included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 55 is not irrelevant to the General
Appropriations Act of 1989 as it deals, quite obviously, with <span style="">appropriations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its </span>purpose is in fact to limit the
powers of the President in the disposition of the <span style="">funds appropriated in that measure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I suggest </span>it is
Section 44 of the Budget Reform Decree and not Section 55 of the General
Appropriations Act of 1989 that <u>is</u> the rider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 44 is extraneous to the subject and
purpose of PD No. 1177, which deals only with "the form, content and
manner of preparation of the budget" that are required to <span style="">"be </span>prescribed by law" <span style="">under </span>Article VI, Sec. 25(1) of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The budget is only a
recommendation of appropriations, not the appropriation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority to augment given by Section 44
of PD No. 1177 belongs in the General Appropriations Act and has no place in
the Budget Reform Decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span> says that to
sanction the inclusion of Section 55 in the General Appropriations Act
"would be to give the Legislature the freedom to grant or withhold the
power from the Executive and other officials and thus put in yearly jeopardy
the exercise of that power" to augment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I respectfully submit that the freedom is not ours to give.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was vested in Congre<span style="">s</span>s by the Constitution itself, and we
ourselves have no authority to grant or withhold it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is needless to debate whatever distinction there may be
between the item and the provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
important consideration is that, whatever its nature, Section 55 <span style="">of </span>the General Appropriations Act <u><span style="">cannot</span></u><span style=""> </span>be vetoed in any case because it seeks to withdraw a <u><span style="">delegated</span></u><span style=""> </span>power.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power of the purse belongs to Congress and has been
traditionally recognized in the constitutional provision <span style="">that “no </span>money shall be paid out of
the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.” The transfer
of funds from one item to another in the General Appropriations Act is part of
that power, except that the Constitution allows Congress to delegate it by law
to the President, the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, the Chief Justice and the heads of the Constitutional
Commissions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When exercising this
authority, the aforementioned officials act not by virtue of their own
competence but only as <u><span style="">agents</span></u><span style=""> </span>of Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should be no question that the agency conferred on these
officials can be revoked by Congress at any time and for any reason it sees
fit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates cannot challenge this
withdrawal and insist on holding on to the authorization that the legislature
had the discretion to withhold from them in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority to augment involves the element
of confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should Congress choose to
withdraw it, a becoming respect for the doctrine of separation of powers, if
not anything else, should persuade the delegates to yield to the wish of the <span class="GramE">principal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The challenge to the validity of Section 55 is to me plain
quibbling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To argue that no recall has
been made is to ignore the obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
matters is the intention of Congress, which should be clear enough if only the
respondents would not muddy the waters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plain and unmistakable intention of Congress is to withdraw from the
President, for its own reasons, the delegated power to augment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following observations in the Emergency Power Cases, 92 Phil.
603, are appropriate:</p>

<blockquote>Although House Bill No. 727 had been vetoed by the President and
did not thereby become a regular statute, it may at least be considered as a
concurrent resolution of the Congress formally declaring the termination of the
emergency powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To contend that the
Bill needed presidential acquiescence to produce effect would lead to the
anomalous, if not absurd, situation that, while Congress might delegate its
powers by a simple majority, it might not be able to recall them except by
two-thirds vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it
would be easier for Congress to delegate its powers than to take them
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not right and is not, and
ought not, to be the law.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I think it would have been more characteristic of the President
if she had graciously respected the will of the Legislature and so again
recognized her role in the constitutional scheme of the Republic.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I regretfully dissent from the Court's opinion in this case
because fundamental principles underlying doctrine of separation of powers were
violated when the President vetoed certain previsions of the 1989 and 1990
Appropriation Bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am disturbed by the consequences of the Court's act of <span class="SpellE">legitimation</span>, among them the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) The traditional power of Congress over the public purse is negated
if functions or offices it has abolished or reduced are restored through the
grant of <u>carte</u> <u>blanche</u> authority to shift savings from one
department or agency to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
the Court is sustaining is no longer augmentation within the purview of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is already fund
juggling against the express command of the body in <span class="GramE">whom</span>
fiscal power is vested.</p>

<p class="BODY">(2) The Court is, in effect, allowing a modified lump sum
appropriation for the entire Executive Branch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Executive is annually given appropriations ranging from <span class="GramE">Two</span> Hundred Billion Pesos to Two Hundred Fifty Billion
Pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever the President calls on
all Departments to <span class="GramE">effect</span> ten percent (10%) savings,
compliance immediately follows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
thus a built in excess of Two Billion Pesos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This tremendous amount can now be used to finance projects which
Congress declares improvident or of low priority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secretaries of executive departments can
thumb their noses at the legislature and, by asking for the President's <u>largesse</u>,
implement even that which has been interdicted.</p>

<p class="BODY">(3) The Constitution does not grant fiscal autonomy to the
Executive Branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no comparison
between the appropriations for the Judiciary and other constitutional offices
on one hand and for the Executive Branch on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is reason to give flexibility in the
use of funds for the Judiciary and other constitutional creatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, tight congressional control over the
way executive programs of government are funded is part of a responsible
presidential system of government.</p>

<p class="BODY">(4) The power to augment is intended for functions, projects, and
offices where both Congress and the President expressly or impliedly concur,
not where one specifically exercises its constitutional power to regulate or
modify the expenditures of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the same way that Congress cannot increase the budgetary proposals of the
Executive, neither should the Executive restore that which Congress has
expressly abolished or reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">(5) The Constitution grants the President power to veto any
particular <u>item</u> or <u>items</u> of an appropriation bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution withholds the power to veto <u>provisions</u>
from the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are rewriting the
Constitution to restore what the framers have eliminated when we ignore the
difference between an <u><span style="">item</span></u><span style=""> </span>and a <u><span style="">provision</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is interpreting the power to augment under Section 25
(5), Article VI of the Constitution as a grant of near <span class="SpellE">untrammelled</span>
authority to shift savings from appropriated funds for functions and projects
never intended by the lawmakers to be funded and worse, for functions and
projects which Congress has <u><span style="">expressly</span></u><span style=""> </span>stated should not be beneficiaries of
public funds for a <span class="GramE">specific</span> year.</p>

<p class="BODY">With a budget of over Two Hundred Billion Pesos (P200<span class="GramE">,000,000,000.00</span>) annually given to the Executive Department,
the implications of the Court's ruling are extremely serious, to say the
least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court's interpretation of the
power of augmentation effectively corrodes the power of Congress over a function
which by its nature is inherently <span class="GramE">legislative</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't believe the Constitution ever
intended to give <u><span style="">carte</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>blanche</u> authority to the
President to suppress certain activities in the Executive Department already
agreed upon with Congress and from the funds thus saved, transfer various
amounts to projects and offices which Congress declares must be abolished or
reduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why not simply give the
President a lump sum allocation of P250 Billion and let it be spent as the
Executive wills?</p>

<p class="BODY">The raising of funds for the e<span style="">x</span>penses of Government is a legislative prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislative power also determines through
Appropriation Acts how the revenues collected shall be spent and for what
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress alone has the power to
give the President the necessary funds to implement Government programs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This vested power of Congress over the
financial affairs of Government underlies and colors all interpretations of
budgetary provisions and appropriation laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because <span style="">of </span>the high
profile of <span class="SpellE">Malacanang</span> in the <span class="SpellE">disbursment</span>
of funds for <span style="">public </span>needs, people
tend to forget that it <span style="">is </span>only
implementing the law as passed by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The President has no power to enact or amend statutes, most specifically
appropriation statutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Executive
merely proposes and submits recommendations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is Congress which decides.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the same <span style="">way </span>that Congress<span style=""> creates public </span>offices, it can also
abolish them whenever, in its opinion, bona fide simplicity,<span style=""> </span>economy, and efficiency would be
achieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By allowing the President
through augmentation to re-create public offices abolished or reduced by
Congress, the Court is treading upon time-tested doctrines, the effects of
which may, in the <span style="">future, be </span>regretted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is misleading for the respondents to tie up the President’s
augmentation authority with the same authority given to the Chief Justice and
the heads of Constitutional Commissions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Judiciary and these Commissions enjoy fiscal autonomy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their roles in the constitutional scheme call
<span style="">for </span>independence and flexibility
in the use of appropriated funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most
of their expenditures are fixed and recurring.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) prunes their requests for
funds to the bone such that when the budget is presented to Congress, there is
nothing more to abolish or reduce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Judiciary and Commissions are usually neglected if not forgotten when the
financial pie is sliced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the
Judiciary with around 23,000 Justices, Judges, Clerks of Court, lawyers, and
other supporting personnel is generally allocated a miniscule one (1%) percent
of the national budget by DBM proposals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the aborted 1991 proposals, the percentage was lowered to 00.67
percent or a little over one-half percent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any savings are quite modest and usually result from non-filling of
judicial positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitutional
Commissions have the same problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court now validates the free use of savings by the Executive against the
express will of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since these
could easily amount not to one percent but to ten percent or more of the
gargantuan budget for the Executive Branch, the implications are extremely
disturbing.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the power given to the Senate President and Speaker, it is
Congress which enacts the law and the need for augmentation is not really
significant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same is not true <span style="">for </span>the
President where the amount from which savings are generated is always beyond
P200 Billion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument that the
leeway granted is delimited to transfers within the department or branch
overlooks the fact that almost the entire budget of the Government is eaten up
by the Executive Branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
relatively <span style="">easy </span>for the Office of
the President, for example, to get P100 Million from funds allocated as
assistance to local governments or construction of major public works and <u>augment</u>
another item anywhere in the entire Executive Branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
</span>indeed the power to rewrite the entire budget.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not the legislative power over the
public purse which alone is denigrated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The power to <span class="SpellE">fiscalize</span> government expenses is
equally diminished.</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional history of the President's item veto power
shows that it should not be interpreted to include the vetoing of <u>provisions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be limited to <u>items</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1935 Constitution granted the power to veto
"provisions" provided the particular item or items to which the
provision relates are also vetoed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1973 Constitution removed the power to veto
"provisions." The Chief Executive was given the power to veto <span style="">only "any particular </span>item or
items" in an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1987 Constitution follows the 1973 formula.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President may veto any particular item or
items <span style="">in </span>an appropriation,
revenue, <span style="">or </span><span class="SpellE">tarrif</span>
bill but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not
object.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion correctly concedes that the terms <u>item</u>
and <u>provision</u> in budgetary legislation and practice are different.</p>

<p class="BODY">If that is so<span style="">, I</span>
fail to see how we can rule that the power of the President under the 1935
Constitution to veto "provisions" remains even if it was expressly
eliminated from both the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the Constitution says
"items", the veto power must be limited to "item." It
cannot include "provisions" which was expressly stricken out.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, laws passed by Congress can be vetoed by the
President only in their <u>entirety</u> or none at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She cannot select provisions and sections she
does not like and veto them while approving the rest of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution allows a limited power of
veto only when it comes to appropriation, revenue or tariff bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power is limited to <u>items</u>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It should not be interpreted by this Court to
mean the expanded power to also veto "provisions."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>To state it in another
way, the President may veto a distinct and severable part of a bill only - (1)
if that severable part is an <u>item</u> and not a <u>provision</u>, and (2) if
that severable part belongs to an appropriation, revenue or tariff bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other must be vetoed in their entirety.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the citation from <span class="SpellE"><u>Bengzon</u></span>
<u>v</u>. <u>Secretary</u> <u>of</u> <u>Justice</u> (299 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.
  S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> 410, 414 [1936]) for a liberal
construction, the veto power is interpreted in favor of validity only when it
is limited to the items it covers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
amount of liberal interpretation, for instance, can allow the President to veto
any item, part, or section of a bill which has nothing to do with
appropriations, revenues, or tariffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">I must emphasize that the provisions vetoed by the President are
not inappropriate and definitely are not riders.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no dispute that Congress has the power to reduce the
budgetary proposals prepared by the Executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">If Congress abolishes, removes, <span style="">or </span>reduces a project, function, or activity by cutting the funds
proposed for it, a provision enforcing that abolition, removal, or reduction is
appropriate and germane to the part thus stricken out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be absurd to require that it should
appear in separate legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">A rider is a provision which is alien to the bill to which it is
attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An example is the Spooner
Amendment which <span class="SpellE">transfered</span> government powers over the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> <span style="">in </span>1901 from the military to the civil<span style=""> </span>government, <span style="">from </span>the Executive to Congress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This section had nothing to <span style="">do </span>with
the Army Appropriation Bill in which it was included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the vetoed provisions in
the instant case specifically refer to appropriations which were disapproved or
reduced in those very same bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the vetoed provisions of the 1989 and 1990 Appropriation
Acts are not only germane to these <span style="">Acts </span>but
are precisely authorized under Section 25 (5) of Article VI of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 25 (5), the President, Senate
President, Speaker, Chief Justice and heads of Constitutional Commissions are <u>by</u><span style=""> </span><u>law</u> authorized to augment items
in the general appropriations <span style="">law </span>for
their respective offices from savings in other items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the majority opinion, the power
to augment from savings lies dormant until authorized by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Congress exercises that dormant <span style="">power </span>and <u><span style="">by</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>law</u>
authorizes these officials <span style="">to </span>augment
items, certainly it has the power to also state what items may not be
augmented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fail to see <span style="">how </span>the exercise of this power can be
termed an inappropriate rider.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grant of the power to augment includes the authority to
specify what matters <span class="GramE">are not part</span> of the granted
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot agree that the 1977
authority to augment appropriations from savings can prevail over 1989 <span style="">and </span>1990 provisions <span style="">to </span>the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1989 grant of the power to augment in
Section 12 <span style="">of </span>the 1989
Appropriations Acts is necessarily circumscribed by the withholding of that power
<span style="">in </span>the provisions illegally
vetoed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One part cannot remain if a
related part is vetoed.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In closing, I repeat that the Court's opinion allows the
President to denigrate and render ineffective a clear and positive expression
of legislative policy on how the funds of Government shall be spent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where Congress expressly states that our
limited funds should not be spent on a particular function or office, we should
not give the President the power to appropriate through transfers of funds the
money to maintain the abolished or greatly reduced function or office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of augmentation is intended to save
programs or projects agreed upon by both the President and Congress where the
funds allocated turn out to be inadequate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was never conceived to render inutile the legislative power over the
purse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to determine how public
funds should be spent should remain lodged where it rightfully belongs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PADILLA, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent mainly for two (2) reasons:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">First:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>the</u> <u>questioned</u>
<u>veto</u> <u>has</u> <u>no</u> <u>constitutional</u> <u>basis</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Article VI, Section 27 of the 1987 Constitution provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 27.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Every bill passed by the Congress shall,
before it becomes a law, be presented to the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he approves the same, he shall sign it;
otherwise, he shall veto it and return the same with his objections to the
House where it originated, which shall enter the objections at large in its
Journal and proceed to reconsider it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of all the Members of such
House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the
objections, to the other House by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and
if approved by two-thirds of all the Members of that House, it shall become a
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all such cases, the votes of
each House shall be determined by yeas or nays, and the names of the Members
voting for or against shall be entered in its Journals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President shall communicate his veto of
any bill to the House where it originated within thirty days after the date of
receipt thereof; otherwise, it shall <span class="GramE">become</span> a law as
if he had signed it.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) The President shall have the power to veto any particular item
or items in an appro­priation, revenue, or tariff bill, but the veto shall not
affect the item or items to which he does not object."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 27 (1) refers to a <u>general</u> <u>veto</u> where the
President objects to an entire bill approved by Congress and returns it to
Congress for its reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
situation at bar is admittedly not a general veto of the appropriation acts for
1989 and 1990,<span style=""> </span>Section 27 (1)
does not, therefore, apply.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>majority
opinion positions the veto questioned in this case within the scope of Section
27 (2) above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not see how
this can be done without doing violence to the constitutional design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinction between an <u>item</u>-<u>veto</u>
and a <u>provision</u>-<u>veto</u> has been traditionally recognized in constitutional
litigation and budgetary practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
stated by Mr. Justice Sutherland, <span style="">s</span>p<span style="">eaking </span>for the U.S. Supreme Court <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Bengzon</u></span><u>
vs. Secretary of Justice</u>, <span style="">299 </span>U.S.
410-416:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span> An item of an appropriation bill obviously means
an item which in itself is <span style="">a </span>specific
appropriation of money, not some general provisions of law which happens to be
put into an appropriation bill. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the Constitution in Section 27 (2) <span style="">empowers the </span>President to <span style="">veto
any </span><u>particular</u> <u>item</u> <u><span style="">or</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>items</u>
<span style="">in </span><span style="">the </span>appropriation act, it does not confer - in fact, it excludes
- the power to veto any <u>particular</u> <u>provision</u> or <u>provisions</u>
in<span style=""> said act.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In an earlier case, <span class="SpellE"><u>Sarmiento</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Mison</span>, et al</u>., 156 SCRA 549, this Court
referred to its duty to construe the Constitution, not in accordance with how
the executive or the <span style="">legislative </span>would
want it construed, but in accordance with what it says and provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Constitution <span style="">states that the President has the power to veto any particular item or
items in the appropriation act, this must be taken as a component of that
delicate balance of power between the executive and the legislative, so that,
for this Court to construe Sec. 27 (2) of the Constitution as also empowering
the President to veto any particular provision or provisions in the
appropriation act, is to load the scale in favor of the executive, at the
expense of that delicate balance of power.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Stated differently, to
stretch the power of the President to veto <u>any</u> <u>item</u> in the
appropriation act so as to include the power to veto any <u>particular</u> <u>provision</u>
in the same act, without any conclusive indication that the same was the intent
of the constitutional framers and the people who adopted the 1987 Constitution,
is for the Court to indulge in spatial constitutional aerobics simply to justify
what, to my mind, is an indefensible presidential veto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Section 55 (FY 1989) and Section 16 (FY
1990) are founded on principles of sound reason and public policy; the attempt
to "veto" them is a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction</u>.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To begin with, Article
VI, Section 25, par. 5 of the 1987 Constitution provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(5) No law shall be passed authorizing any transfer of
appropriations; however, the Presi­dent, the President of the Senate, the
Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, and the heads of Constitutional Commissions may, by law, be authorized
to augment any item in the general appropriations law for their respective
offices from savings in other items of their respective appropriations."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be at once noted that the <u>fundamental</u> <u>policy</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Constitution</u> is against transfer of appropriations
even by law, since this "juggling" of funds is often a rich source of
unbridled patronage, abuse and interminable corruption.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the same provision allows the enactment of <span style="">a </span>law that would authorize the
President of the Philippines, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the
House, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the heads of Constitutional
Commissions to augment from savings realized from any appropriations for their
respective offices, any other item of appropriation also for their
offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with this
Constitutional leave, Section 12 of the appro­priation act of 1989 (also
Section 16 (1st part) of the appropriation act of 1990) provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 12.</span> <span class="GramE">Use of
Savings.</span> - The President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of
the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Heads
of the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman are hereby authorized to
augment any item in this Act for their respective offices from savings in other
items of their respective appropriations."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, a transfer from savings is allowed to augment any
appropriation pertaining to the office which <span class="GramE">effects</span>
the savings.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And yet, Congress as the appropriating and funding department of
the Government has seen fit to place a condition <span style="">or </span>a qualification in the authority to augment, from savings,
any appropriation in the offices concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It requires that <u>no such savings can be used to augment an
appropriation previously disapproved by Congress or to restore an appropriation
previously reduced by Congress</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I can see no valid reason, in logic or in sound management, why
such a condition can not be accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
only makes certain that congressional action disapproving an appropriation or
reducing the amount of an <span class="GramE">appropriation,</span> is not
rendered inutile or meaningless by a transfer of savings in an appropriation to
such other items already disapproved or reduced by Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">It can hardly be disputed that the condition, restriction or
qualification embodied in Sections 55 and 16, here discussed, was enacted by
Congress in the exercise of its legislative power to appropriate funds for
government operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exercise of
that <u>legislative</u> <u>power</u>, in the first instance, should be accorded
due respect and, as I see it, the veto of the said condition is an undue
encroachment by the executive on a properly exercised legislative power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in delineating power boundaries
between the different departments of government, sadly expands, in this case,
the bounds of an already too-powerful executive, at the expense of legislative
prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority appear to have
overlooked that the power to appropriate and set reasonable conditions
incidental thereto is a function entrusted by the Constitution in the
legislature and only in the legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Bolinao</u></span><u>
vs. </u></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><u>Valencia</u></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">, G.R. No.</span> L-20740, 30 June 1964, 11 SCRA 486, this Court
already had occasion <span style="">to </span>uphold a
condition laid down by the legislative in an appropriation measure, to the
extent of declaring a presidential veto of such condition as illegal if made
separately from the appropriation itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"It may be observed from the wordings of the Appropriations
Act that the amount appropriated for the operation of the Philippine
Broadcasting Service was made subject to the condition that the same shall not
be used or expended for operation of television stations <span style="">in </span>Luzon, where there are already
existing commercial television stations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This gives rise to the question of whether the President <span style="">may </span>legally veto a condition attached
to an appropriation or item in the appropriation bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this is not a novel question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little effort to research on the subject
would have yielded enough authority to guide action on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in the leading case of State v. Holder,
it was already declared that such action by the Chief Executive was
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling, that the
executive's veto power does not carry<span style=""> </span>with
it the power to strike out conditions or restrictions, has been adhered to in
subsequent cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the veto is
unconstitutional, it follows that the same produced no effect whatsoever, and
the restriction imposed by the appropriation bill, therefore, remains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any expenditure made by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> PBS, for the purpose of installing or operating
a television station in Manila, where there are already television stations in
operation, would be in violation of the express condition for the release of
the appropriation and, consequently, null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By clear analogy, the President could not veto Sections 55 (FY
1989) and 16 (FY 1990) as conditions, without vetoing the items or
appropriations which are affected by <span style="">said
</span>conditions, meaning, the entire appropriation bills.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to GRANT the petition and to declare
the presidential veto of <span style="">Section </span>55
(FY 1989) and<span style=""> </span>Section 16 (FY
1990) as null and void and of no effect whatsoever, for being clearly
unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that
Sections 55 (FY 1989) and 16 (FY 1990) remain as binding conditions <span style="">in </span>the disposition of savings in
appropriations covered by the appropriation acts for 1989 and 1990.</p>
