<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution, as succinctly summarized by the
trial court, is, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10 o'clock</st1:time>
that morning of <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1974</st1:date>,
the 28-year old accused, who is well-known to <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>
(as his wife <span style="">is </span>the niece of the
father-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Aurea's</span> father), went to the house
where <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> lives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> was left alone in the house together
with her 2-year old half brother who was then sleeping in the hammock under the
house; her grandfather was threshing <span class="SpellE"><i>palay</i></span> in
the field; her brother, <span class="SpellE">Vir­gilio</span>, had gone out to
the house of their neighbor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nearest
house is about 55 meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previous to
that date, the accused had gone to the house of <span class="SpellE">Aurea's</span>
grandfather as he tilled a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> near­by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused first looked at the pictures,
then he sat beside <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> on the bench and as <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> transferred to the sofa, he sat beside her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He held <span class="SpellE">Aurea's</span>
hands and <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> struggled in vain to extricate
herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded to lift and place
her on his lap and then carried her to the kitchen some 8 meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He placed her down and, despite the
resistance put up by her, by sheer superior force he removed her <span class="SpellE">pantie</span>, placed himself on top of her, and inserted his
penis into her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> experienced extreme pain upon penetration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was unable to shout for help as the
accused placed a handkerchief into her mouth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the sexual act, he warned her not to tell anybody or he would kill
her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On May 1, while <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> was with her
cousin, 13-year old <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Andig</span>,
in the house the ac­cused arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asked <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> did not allow
<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> to go.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> refused to get out, the accused sat
beside her, held her hands, and placed them over his unexposed penis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> pulled away
her hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A moment later</span>, the accused went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that occasion <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>
revealed to <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> that the accused had raped her
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This revelation was transmitted
by <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span style="">to
</span>her mother and it was the latter who told <span class="SpellE">Aurea's</span>
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Late in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="5">Sunday, May 5, 1974</st1:date>, at the house of
his parent-in-law where <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> stayed, <span class="SpellE">Aurea's</span> father verified from her and was told by <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> about the rape on her by the accused on April
22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, May 6, he brought
<span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> to the PC Headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>
<span style="">where </span>a formal charge was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> was
interrogated and her sworn statement (Exhibit A) taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day she was physically examined
at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where it was found that her vaginal canal easily admitted one finger and there
were healed lacerations at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6 <span style="">o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> </span>and <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1
 o'clock</st1:time> <span style="">on </span>her
external orifice of the vagina (Exhibit C).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1974</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> filed a verified complaint for rape (Exhibit B)
against the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> explained that she did not
tell her grandfather and father soon after the accused raped her because she
was afraid as the accused threatened to kill her if she would tell
anybody."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant assails the said decision, claiming among others,
that no rape has been committed since the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hangad</span>, did not offer much resistance when she was
allegedly ravished <span style="">by </span>the
appellant, hinting that she was a willing victim to the sexual <span style="">act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence adduced by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aurea</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Hangad</span> in support of her claim that she was abused by the
appellant, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span>,
against her <span style="">will, consists of her </span>own
sole and uncorroborated testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rule in this jurisdiction is that a c<span style="">harge
of </span>rape based upon the sole testimony of <span style="">one </span>who complains of rape should be regarded with utmost caution
and that the person <span style="">charged </span>with
the offense should not be convicted unless the complainant's testimony is
impeccable and rings true throughout.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the <span style="">instant case, </span>the
complainant's uncorroborated narrative invites criticism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the start of the assault when the
appellant held her hands and placed her on his lap, the complainant made no
outcry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She continued in <span style="">silence </span>while the appellant lifted her
from the sofa and carried <span style="">her to the </span>kitchen.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, instead of attempting <span style="">to </span>escape,
she willingly laid down near the earthen stove upon being told <span style="">by </span>the <span style="">appellant </span>to <span style="">do so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Her </span>testimony
reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
then he placed you on the floor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He made <span style="">me </span>lie down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
you willingly lie down?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is correct because he made me lie
down."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The complainant did not also make any
significant attempt to prevent <span style="">the </span>appellant
from removing her underwear and have sexual intercourse with her, although the
appellant was unarmed, or that he threatened the complainant or made
threatening gestures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her declaration <span style="">in </span>court reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did you do also?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to <span class="SpellE">manuever</span>
myself making my side top of the floor and he removed his pants and placed
himself on top of me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
placing himself on top of you, what did he do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp; </span>He exposed his penis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
exposing his penis, what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He </span>guided
his penis to my vagina.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
effect was <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span>
able to insert his penis to your vagina?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It penetrated a little because whenever he exerted
effort it is very painful.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the penis of <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span>
was inserted to your vagina, what did <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span> do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He</span>
did push and pull movement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
how long do you think did <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span>
make push and pull movement?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It did not take long.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the time the penis of <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span>
was inside your vagina, what did he do with your hands<span style="">, </span>he did anything?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He held my hands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
you like what <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span>
did to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not feel (enjoy) <span style="">t</span>he sensation because what he did was
ugly thing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were
you able to shout during that time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>Q
<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was not able to shout because he placed
handkerchief inside my mouth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
<span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span> inserted his
penis to your vagina, what did <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span> (I will reform the question.)</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapao</span> had <span class="SpellE">intercoursed</span> with you, what did he do?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Furthermore,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Her claim</span><span style=""> that she </span><span style="">did not </span>tell <span style="">her father
or grandfather</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the rape because of the threat made after </span>the
sexual act <span style="">is preposterous </span>since
it appears that the complainant had told <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Antig</span> of the alleged assault in the very presence and
hearing of the appellant, and the appellant did nothing about it, but meekly
left the house of <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony reads, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Such conduct and behavior in the light of
the threat made are contrary to the ordinary course of things and common
experience and create in the mind some serious doubt as to the truthfulness and
veracity of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
appellant had truly threatened the complain­ant, as alleged, he would have
reacted violently instead of merely going home.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the alleged threat was not made to intimidate the
complainant into having sexual intercourse with the appellant, but was made
after the sexual act in order to keep her quiet, so that there is no sufficient
evidence to show beyond reasonable doubt that rape had been committed and that
the appellant is guilty thereof.</p>
