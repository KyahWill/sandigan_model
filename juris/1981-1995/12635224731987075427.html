The issue in this case is whether the lessee should be allowed to pay 
the docket fee and file an appeal bond after the 15-day period.
<p>
The city court of Pasay City on March 11, 1978 rendered a decision 
ordering Kapisanang Magkakapit­bahay Damayan at Abuluyan, Inc. to vacate
 the lots located at the corner of Leveriza Street and Buendia Avenue, 
Pasay City, to restore the owner, FJR Garments Industries, to the 
possession thereof and to pay the accumulated back rentals as of 
November, 1977 in the sum of P87,110.55 and the monthly rental of P2,250
 from December, 1977 until the lots are vacated and P5,000 as attorney's
 fees (p. 29, CA <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
That decision was served on Kapisanan on July 6, 1978. Nine days 
thereafter, or on July 15, 1978, Kapisanan filed a notice of appeal but 
it did not pay the docket fee of P20 and the appeal bond of P50 and post
 the supersedeas bond of P107,860, as required by sections 2 and 3, Rule
 40 in relation to section 8, Rule 70 and section 5(12), Rule 141, Rules
 of Court.
</p><p>
On August 3, 1978, or <em>28 days after service of the decision</em>, the city court "disapproved" Kapisanan's appeal. Without filing any motion for reconsideration, Kapisanan filed <em>the next day</em>
 in the Court of First Instance of Pasay City a petition for relief from
 judgment on the ground of mistake and excusable negligence consisting 
of the alleged mis­interpretation made by a member of Kapisanan in 
paying only the postage stamps for the notice mailed to adverse counsel 
instead of the docket fee and appeal bond.
</p><p>
The lower court in its order of August 25, 1978 <em>dismissed</em> the petition for relief because of its finding that Kapisanan's failure to appeal was due to its <em>inexcusable neglect</em> (p. 50, CA <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
Kapisanan filed on August 28, 1978 a petition for certiorari in the 
Court of Appeals to annul the lower court's order of August 25 (p. 8, CA
 <em>Rollo</em>). It may be argued that, as only a legal issue is 
involved, it should have appealed to this Court under Republic Act No. 
5440 which superseded Rule 42 of the Rules of Court. The Appellate Court
 <em>reversed</em> the lower court's decision and directed the city 
court to allow Kapisanan to perfect its appeal within ten days from the 
finality of its judgment.
</p><p>
We hold that the failure of Kapisanan to perfect its appeal was not a 
pardonable oversight. It is not entitled to relief from judgment because
 there was no fraud or excusable neglect which prevented it from 
seasonably appealing to the Court of First Instance. Moreover, its 
petition had no affidavit of merits.
</p><p>
Furthermore, its failure to file a supersedeas bond rendered the city court's judgment immediately executory.
</p><p>
The fact that even before the expiration of the 15-day period the city 
court declared Kapisanan's appeal "moot and academic" is of no moment 
since the fact is that during that period the lessee did not attempt to 
pay the docket fee and appeal bond.
</p><p>
The Appellate Court's reference to liberality in the interpretation of 
the Rules of Court in the matter of appeals refers to the material data 
rule found in section 6 of Rule 41. This case does not involve the 
material data rule.
</p><p>
Rules of court prescribing the time within which certain acts must be 
done, or certain proceedings taken, are absolutely indispensable to the 
prevention of needless delays and the orderly and speedy discharge of 
judicial business. Strict compliance with such rules is mandatory and 
imperative. (Shioji vs. Harvey, 43 Phil. 333, 341; Alvero vs. De la 
Rosa, 76 Phil. 428).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and set aside with costs against respondent Kapisanan.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, Escolin,</em> and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
