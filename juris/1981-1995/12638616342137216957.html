				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The principal issue in this Petition is whether or not the
retrenchment of the private respondents amounts to an illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Petition is erroneously captioned as a
Petition for Review on <i><u>Certiorari</u></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This error notwithstanding, and in the interest
of justice, the Court resolved to treat the Petition as a special civil action
for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> on account of the jurisdictional issues raised
herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Cototabato</span>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioner informed the private respondents that they were going to be
retrenched effective <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1984</st1:date>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>account of serious financial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">problems </span>confronting the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondents were eventually
terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner offered each of the private respondents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">one</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

respondents refused the offer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
of the view that there was no valid retrenchment inasmuch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>the business of the petitioner had
been profitable for the past several years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Accordingly, they </span>demanded
one month salary for every year of service as separation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pay, </span>as well as other benefits due
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the private respondents filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>Complaint
for illegal dismissal against the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petitioner
</span>with the Regional Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations

hearing officer assigned to the case submitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

he </span>recommended that the petitioner be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span></span>The Executive Labor Arbiter adopted the recommendation of the
hearing officer in his Decision dated <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="10">October
 18, 1985</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 9, 1985, the petitioner brought an appeal to the
National Labor Relations Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
On October 30, 1986, while the case was pending on appeal, private respondent
Edna C. Tan entered into a compromise agreement with the petitioner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
For this reason, the said parties sought the dismissal of the Complaint filed
by the said private respondent against the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They filed a joint Motion to Dismiss for this
purpose.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated August 31, 1987, the Second Division of the
National Labor Relations Commission upheld <u>in</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Decision of the Executive Labor Arbiter and dismissed the appeal of the

<p class="BODY">On December 18, 1987, the petitioner elevated the case to this
Court by way of the instant Petition.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that
</span>the retrenchment it had undertaken was valid on account of the serious
financial problems of the firm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner points out that although its audited financial statements show that
the firm generated profits from 1981 up to the time the private respondents
were retrenched on <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1984</st1:date>,
it still suffered losses for the said years considering that the bank has a
number of accounts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>settle
with the Central Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
also alleges that it will suffer greater losses as a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>result of the withdrawal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of
various tax</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">exemptions enjoyed

argues </span>that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">award </span>in

<p class="BODY">In fine, the Petition is anchored on the argument <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that </span>the respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Commission c</span>ommitted a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">grave </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">his </span>Comment
dated June 24, 1988,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the Solicitor </span>General contends
that at<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> the </span>time of the
retrenchment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">the </span></span>private respondents, the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">had </span>substantial credits in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>form of accrued receivables from
funds it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">had <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">loaned </span></span>to the public in an amount that was more than enough
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to pay </span>for all of its
outstanding obligations to the Central Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He points out that if this observation were not true, the petitioner
should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">have b</span>een out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of business a long time ago.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">He likewise argues that at the time of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the </span>said retrenchment<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">,
there</span> was<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>then no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">way </span>of assessing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>perceived adverse effects of
Presidential Decree No. 1955 on the petitioner simply because there were no
rules and regulations to implement the said Decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The potential losses claimed by the
petitioner relating to the Decree are dismissed by the Solicitor General as
mere speculations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, he maintains that the private respondents were illegally
dismissed pursuant to an invalid retrenchment undertaken by the petitioner and
they are entitled to one month salary for every year of service as separation
pay, and such other amounts of money that are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">due </span>them.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the award of interest, attorney's fees, costs of litigation
as well as moral and exemplary damages, the Solicitor General stresses that
such award was based on the petitioner's willful refusal to pay the amounts of
money due the private respondents as alleged by the latter in their
Complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He adds that the petitioner
never refuted these allegations when it could have done so in its Position
Paper submitted to the hearing officer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of
</span>the respondent Commission, and that, accordingly, the petitioner cannot
be heard to disavow the same at this stage of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General agrees, however, that the award in favor of
private respondent Tan should not have been sustained by the respondent
Commission inasmuch as she had already entered into a compromise agreement with
the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
submits that her inclusion in the Resolution of the respondent Commission was
an oversight.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the Solicitor General seeks the dismissal of the instant
Petition for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination of the entire record of the case, the
Court finds <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the </span>instant Petition
devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not convinced that the retrenchment undertaken by the
petitioner was brought about by serious financial problems confronting the
company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner admits that it
realized profits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">from </span>1981 and
thereafter, even up to the time the private respondents were terminated in
November, 1984.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This notwithstanding, the petitioner alleges that it has numerous accounts to
settle with the Central <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Bank in an </span>amount
exceeding<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>the said profits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Be</span>
that as it may, the petitioner makes no mention of its credits and other
receivables from funds it had loaned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">out
</span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These credits and receivables must be in an
amount greater than the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">alleged <span class="GramE">payables,</span> otherwise, as </span>observed by the Solicitor
General, the petitioner should have been out of business a long <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">t</span>ime ago.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has not clearly demonstrated how Presidential
Decree No. 1955 can bring about adverse effects on its business to such an
extent that it has no choice but to retrench several employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These potential losses claimed by the
petitioner are simply speculative in character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They cannot justify the retrenchment undertaken by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">then, </span>there
is no basis for the alleged retrenchment of the private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To all intents and purposes, they were
illegally dismissed by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Taking this observation into account, the award of interest,
attorney's fees, costs of litigation as well as moral and exemplary damages in
favor of the private respondents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>in
order.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards private respondent Tan, the award in her favor should
not have been sustained by the respondent Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had already entered into a compromise
agreement with the petitioner and as such, all her claims against the
petitioner must be considered settled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent Commission must have committed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">a </span>mistake in this regard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the Resolution of the respondent Commission should be
deemed modified to include a statement that all her claims against the
petitioner are considered settled on account of the compromise agreement <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">she had </span>entered into with the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">By and large, however, the Court is of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the </span>well-considered opinion that the
respondent National Labor Relations Commission did not commit a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to loss of jurisdiction in dismissing the appeal of the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, except for the above
stated modification of the resolution of respondent Commission that all the
claims of private respondent Edna C. Tan had been settled, the instant Petition
is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit as to the other private respondents,
without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
