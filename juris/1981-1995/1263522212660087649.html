New Frontier Mines, Inc. seeks the nullification of the Labor Arbiter's 
decision, declaring illegal the dismissal of Crisanto H. Briones, its 
managerial employee, and ordering his reinstatement with backwages from 
the time of his dismissal until actually reinstated. The decision was 
affirmed by Commissioners Atienza and Quadra. Commissioner Villatuya 
dissented.
<p>
Crisanto H. Briones was employed by New Frontier Mines, Inc. in its 
Makati head office on January 30, 1974 at a starting salary of P650 a 
month (p. 76, <em>Rollo</em>), not at P1,000 a month as erroneously stated by the Labor Arbiter (p. 99, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
On February 2, 1976, Briones was promoted to accountant at P1,000 a month (p. 16, <em>Rollo</em>).
 In June 1976, he was assigned at the company's chromite project located
 in the mountain of Lagonoy, Camarines Sur, an isolated place. He 
functioned as chief accountant and administrative officer at P1,200 a 
month (p. 99, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
He performed multifarious duties. He acted as cashier, paymaster, 
purchase clerk, personnel officer, liaison officer and operations 
manager in the absence of the incumbent (p. 205, <em>Rollo</em>). By 
reason of his varied assignments, he was considered a managerial 
employee. His controversial performance in this job during the six-month
 period of June to December, 1976 led to his removal.
</p><p>
The Labor Arbiter found that Briones "committed several errors in his 
report of cash accountabilities covering the months from June to 
November, 1976" (p. 100, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
The project manager charged him with having incurred a cash shortage of 
P8,000, having illicit relations with a female housekeeper at the 
project site, drinking liquor every night and possible mis­appropriation
 of funds (Respondent's comment, p. 161, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
Jose C. Chung, then the company's general manager, on October 15, 1976 
went to Lagonoy to make an on-the-spot check on Briones' accountability.
 Chung found a shortage of P3,800 which was a cash advance against 
Briones' salary (readjusted to P3,386.87) but which Briones considered 
only a "theoretical shortage" (pp. 49, 161-2, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
The Labor Arbiter found that on January 5, 1977 at a meeting in the 
Makati head office attended by the company president, vice-president, 
general manager and corporate secretary, Briones was directed to revise 
his cash position report for October and November, 1976, considering 
errors and unreported expenses incurred at the Lagonoy project not taken
 up in prior reports. He was advised that his accounts would be verified
 by an external auditor (p. 100, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
On January 15, 1977, Briones submitted his revised accounts. Then, from 
that date up to June 15, 1977 he did not report to the office. His 
excuse was that he wanted the auditor to have a free hand and he had to 
attend to his sick wife. Did he file a formal leave of absence? That is a
 disputed point in this case.
</p><p>
The Labor Arbiter said that it was his "strong feeling" that Briones' 
application for leave reached the company official concerned (p. 103, <em>Rollo</em>).
 However, the trouble is that, as observed by Commissioner Villatuya, 
Briones failed to sustain the onus of proving that he filed an 
application for leave, and, in the absence of proof, it would be wrong 
for the Labor Arbiter to assume that the application was granted. 
Rather, it should be concluded that he was absent without leave.
</p><p>
<em>No documentary evidence</em> was presented to prove that Briones was
 on leave from January 15 to October, 1977. Not even a duplicate of the 
letter, allegedly prepared for him by Tereso L. Javier, the general 
manager, wherein Briones was applying for leave, was presented in 
evidence. The action taken by the pre­sident on his supposed application
 for leave was not offered in evidence. How long the leave was supposed 
to last was not proven. No mention of his leave was made in his letter 
to Chung of September, 1977.
</p><p>
Briones merely claimed in his position paper of January 19, 1978 that 
the application for leave, after having been prepared by Javier, "was 
not submitted" to the president "as the latter had already left the 
office" (p. 56, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
Javier himself in his affidavit alleged that Briones "since January 15, 
1977, without the knowledge and consent" of the company "failed to 
report for work for an unreasonable length of time without permission or
 notice to the company" (p. 50, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
According to Briones, in May, 1977, he dropped at the residence of 
Chung, the vice-president, to inquire about his employment status. Chung
 told him to go to the office on June 15. On that day, Briones reported 
to Javier. But Javier allegedly said that Chung should decide the case. 
It was only on September 26, 1977 when Briones wrote to Chung to ask him
 what action was taken on his revised accounts (pp. 205-206, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
Chung replied in a letter dated October 27, 1977. He apprised Briones that there was a <em>net shortage in his accounts of P7,425.45</em> and that Briones was <em>considered resigned in view of his failure to report for work since January 15, 1977.</em> Said Chung:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "You were absent for several weeks without prior notice of leave 
or permission from the company. In view of your action of not reporting 
for work for a long period of time without permission, <em>we have no alternative but to consider you resigned from the company</em>" (p. 207, <em>Rollo</em>).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Briones filed his complaint for illegal dis­missal on November 9, 1977. 
The Labor Arbiter decided the case on July 31, 1978 on the basis of the 
position papers. As already stated, he found that Briones was a 
managerial employee and he ordered his reinstatement with backwages. 
Commissioners Atienza and Quadra affirmed that decision. The company 
filed its petition for certiorari on November 12, 1979.
</p><p>
The company's Lagonoy project ceased operation in 1978 due to the low 
price of chromite. Three hundred laborers working in the project were 
laid off. Briones' former position in the Makati office had been filled 
up (p. 33, <em>Rollo</em>). He is now 61 years old. <em>He has been working in Saudi Arabia since the early part of 1980</em> (p. 344, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
We hold that the Labor Arbiter and Commissioners Atienza and Quadra 
acted with grave abuse of discre­tion in ordering the reinstatement with
 backwages of Briones, a managerial employee.
</p><p>
The Labor Arbiter erred in finding, on the basis of his "strong feeling"
 and assumptions, that Briones filed a leave of absence. The conduct of 
Briones and the concomitant circumstances showed that no such leave was 
filed.
</p><p>
As a managerial employee, the company had the right to terminate 
Briones' services "for lack of confidence" and abandonment of work 
(Policy Ins­tructions No. 8, April 23, 1976, pp. 128-129, Vicente B. 
Foz, Labor Code, 1979 Edition, Philippine Law Gazette. See Bondoc vs. 
People's Bank and Trust Company, L-43835, March 31, 1981, 103 SCRA 599).
</p><p>
Therefore, the order for reinstatement is devoid of justification. However, as a matter of <em>compassionate justice</em>, Briones may be given three months' separation pay for 1974, 1975 and 1976 at the rate of P1,200 a month.
</p><p>
The motion of Briones dated August 21, 1983, that the instant petition 
be dismissed because of the expiration of 18 months from May 20, 1981, 
when the case was submitted for decision, is not well-taken. What was 
really meant in this Court's reso­lution of May 20, 1981, issued after 
the memoranda had been submitted, is that this case would be sche­duled 
for deliberation to find out whether the necessary vote could be had.
</p><p>
The framers of the Constitution did not foresee that the numerousness or
 deluge of cases in this Court would render it impossible to schedule 
regularly the deliberation on pending cases.
</p><p>
Daily, this Court is swamped with a great number of (1) appealed civil and criminal cases, (2) petitions for <em>certiorari, mandamus</em>, prohibition, <em>quo warranto </em>and <em>habeas corpus</em>,
 (3) disbarment cases and (4) administrative matters and cases of 
judiciary personnel, aside from the cases undecided before the 
Constitution took effect.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the decision of the Labor Arbiter and the resolution of 
Commissioners Atienza and Quadra are reversed and set aside. The 
petitioner is ordered to pay three months' separation pay to Crisanto H.
 Briones. No costs.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Guerrero, Abad Santos</em>, and <em>Escolin, JJ.</em>, concur.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., J.</em>, on leave.
