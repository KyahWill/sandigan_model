				G.R. No. 110571, March 10, 1994</h4>
				<H3>FIRST LEPANTO CERAMICS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS AND MARIWASA MANUFACTURING, INC., RESPONDENTS.<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>NOCON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Brought to fore in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
with application for preliminary injunction is the novel question of where and
in what manner appeals from decisions of the Board of Investments (BOI) should
be filed.  A thorough scrutiny of the
conflicting provisions of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, otherwise known as the
"Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980," Executive Order No. 226, also
known as the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 and Supreme Court Circular No.
1-91 is, thus, called for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Briefly, this question of law arose when BOI, in its decision
dated December 10, 1992 in BOI Case No. 92-005 granted petitioner First Lepanto
Ceramics, Inc.'s application to amend its BOI certificate of registration by
changing the scope of its registered product from "glazed floor
tiles" to "ceramic tiles." Eventually, oppositor Mariwasa filed
a motion for reconsideration of the said BOI decision while oppositor
Fil-Hispano Ceramics, Inc. did not move to reconsider the same nor appeal
therefrom.  Soon rebuffed in its bid for
reconsideration, Mariwasa filed a petition for review with respondent Court of
Appeals pursuant to Circular 1-91.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the petition, respondent court required the BOI and
petitioner to comment on Mariwasa's petition and to show cause why no
injunction should issue.  On February
17, 1993, respondent court temporarily restrained the BOI from implementing its
decision.  This temporary restraining
order lapsed by its own terms on March 9, 1993, twenty (20) days after its
issuance, without respondent court issuing any preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 24, 1993, petitioner filed a "Motion to Dismiss
Petition and to Lift Restraining Order" on the ground that respondent
court has no appellate jurisdiction over BOI Case No. 92-005, the same being
exclusively vested with the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 82 of the Omnibus
Investments Code of 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 25, 1993, respondent court denied petitioner's motion to
dismiss, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, private respondent's motion to dismiss the
petition is hereby DENIED, for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Private respondent is hereby given an inextendible period of
ten (10) days from receipt hereof within which to file its comment to the
petition."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of a copy of the above resolution on June 4, 1993,
petitioner decided not to file any motion for reconsideration as the question
involved is essentially legal in nature and immediately filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition before this <span style="">Court.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner posits the view that respondent court acted without or
in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing the questioned resolution of May 25,
1993, for the following reasons:</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">I</span>.  Respondent court has no jurisdiction to entertain Mariwasa's appeal from
the BOI's decision in BOI Case No. 92-005, which has become final.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span style="">II</span>.   The appellate jurisdiction conferred by statute upon this
Honorable Court cannot be amended or superseded by Circular No. 1-91."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then concludes that:</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">III</span>.  Mariwasa has lost its right to appeal x x x in this case."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980
or Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 and Circular 1-91, "Prescribing the Rules
Governing Appeals to the Court of Appeals from a Final Order or Decision of the
Court of Tax Appeals and Quasi-Judicial Agencies" cannot be the basis of
Mariwasa's appeal to respondent court because the procedure for appeal laid
down therein runs contrary to Article 82 of E.O. 226, which provides that
appeals from decisions or orders of the BOI shall be filed directly with this
Court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Judicial relief.- All orders or decisions of the Board (of
Investments) in cases involving the provisions of this Code shall immediately
be executory.  No appeal from the order
or decision of the Board by the party adversely affected shall stay such an
order or decision; <u><span style="">Provided</span></u><span style="">, </span>that all appeals shall be filed
directly with the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days from receipt of the
order or decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Mariwasa maintains that whatever "obvious
inconsistency" or "irreconcilable repugnancy" there may have
been between B.P. 129 and Article 82 of E.O. 226 on the question of venue for
appeal has already been resolved by Circular 1-91 of the Supreme Court, which
was promulgated on February 27, 1991 or four (4) years after E.O. 226 was
enacted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Circular 1-91, is herein quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>“1.  Scope.- These rules shall apply to appeals
from final orders or decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals.  They shall also apply to appeals from final
orders or decisions of any quasi-judicial agency from which an appeal is now
allowed by statute to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.  Among these agencies are the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission,
Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer,
National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National
Telecommunications Commission, Secretary of Agrarian Reform and Special
Agrarian Courts under RA 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees
Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission
and Philippine Atomic Energy Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  Cases not covered.- These rules shall not
apply to decisions and interlocutory orders of the National Labor Relations Commission
or the Secretary of Labor and Employment under the Labor Code of the
Philippines, the Central Board of Assessment Appeals, and other quasi-judicial
agencies from which no appeal to the courts is prescribed or allowed by
statute.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  Who may appeal and where to appeal.- The
appeal of a party affected by a final order, decision, or judgment of the Court
of Tax Appeals or of a quasi-judicial agency shall be taken to the Court of
Appeals within the period and in the manner herein provided, whether the appeal
involves questions of fact or of law or mixed questions of fact and law.  From final judgments or decisions of the
Court of Appeals, the aggrieved party may appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to the
Supreme Court as provided in Rule 45 of the Rules of Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may <span style="">be </span>recalled
that Section 9(3) of B.P. 129 vests appellate jurisdiction over all final
judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of quasi-judicial agencies
on the Court of Appeals, to <span style="">wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(3) Exclusive
appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions,
orders, or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi?judicial agencies,
instrumentalities, boards or commissions, except those falling within the
appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution,
the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and
subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of
1948.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Intermediate Appellate Court shall have the power to try cases
and conduct hearings, receive evidence and perform any and all acts necessary
to resolve factual issues raised in cases falling within its original and
appellate jurisdiction, including the power to grant and conduct new trials or
further proceedings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These provisions shall not apply to decisions and interlocutory
orders issued under the Labor Code of the Philippines and by the Central Board
of Assessment Appeals."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly evident in the aforequoted provision of B.P. 129 is the
laudable objective of providing a uniform procedure of appeal from decisions of
all quasi-judicial agencies for the benefit of the bench and the bar.  Equally laudable is the twin objective of
B.P. 129 of unclogging the docket of this Court to enable it to attend to more
important tasks, which in the words of Dean Vicente G. Sinco, as quoted in our
decision in Conde v. Intermediate Appellate Court<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> is
"less concerned with the decisions of cases that begin and end with the
transient rights and obligations of particular individuals but is more
intertwined with the direction of national policies, momentous economic and
social problems, the delimitation of governmental authority and its impact upon
fundamental rights."</p>

<p class="BODY">In Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court noted that B.P. 129 did not deal only with "changes in the
rules on procedures" and that not only was the Court of Appeals
reorganized, but its jurisdiction and powers were also broadened by Section 9
thereof.  Explaining the changes, this
Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x Its original jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>mandamus</i>,
prohibition, <i>certiorari </i>and <i>habeas corpus, </i>which theretofore
could be exercised only in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, was expanded by
(1) extending it so as to include the writ of <i>quo warranto, </i>and also (2)
empowering it to issue all said extraordinary writs 'whether or not in aid of
its appellate jurisdiction.' Its appellate jurisdiction was also extended to
cover not only final judgments of Regional Trial Courts, but also 'all final
judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of x x quasi-judicial
agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions, except those falling within
the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the
Constitution, the provisions of this Act, and of sub-paragraph (1) of the third
paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the
Judiciary Act of 1948,' it being noteworthy in this connection that the text of
the law is broad and comprehensive, and the explicitly stated exceptions have no
reference whatever to the Court of Tax Appeals.  Indeed, the intention to expand the original and appellate
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over quasi-judicial agencies,
instrumentalities, boards, or commissions, is further stressed by the last paragraph
of Section 9 which excludes from its provisions, only the 'decisions and
interlocutory orders issued under the Labor Code of the Philippines and by the
Central Board of Assessment Appeals.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, it cannot be denied that the lawmaking system of the
country is far from perfect.  During the
transitional period after the country emerged from the Marcos regime, the
lawmaking power was lodged on the Executive Department.  The obvious lack of deliberation in the
drafting of our laws could perhaps explain the deviation of some of our laws
from the goal of uniform procedure which <span style="">B.P.
</span><span style="">129 </span>sought to promote.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="">In exempli gratia,</span></i><span style=""> </span>Executive Order No. <span style="">226 </span>or the Omnibus Investments Code of <span style="">1987 </span>provides that all appeals shall be
filed directly with the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days from receipt of
the order or decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Noteworthy is the fact that presently, the Supreme Court
entertains ordinary appeals only from decisions of the Regional Trial Courts in
criminal cases where the penalty imposed is <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style=""> </span>or
higher.  Judgments of regional trial
courts may be appealed to the Supreme Court only by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
within fifteen (15) days from notice of judgment in accordance with Rule <span style="">45 </span>of the Rules of Court in relation to
Section <span style="">17 </span>of the Judiciary Act
of <span style="">1948, </span>as amended, this being
the clear intendment of the provision of the Interim Rules that "(a)ppeals
to the Supreme Court shall be taken by petition for <i>certiorari</i> which
shall be governed by Rule <span style="">45 </span>of
the Rules of Court." Thus, the right of appeal provided in E.O. 226 within
thirty (30) days from receipt of the order or decision is clearly not in
consonance with the present procedure before this Court.  Only decisions, orders or rulings of a
Constitutional Commission (Civil Service Commission, Commission on Elections or
Commission on Audit), may be brought to the Supreme Court on original petitions
for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule <span style="">65 </span>by
the aggrieved party within thirty (30) days from receipt of a copy thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under this contextual backdrop, this Court, pursuant to its
Constitutional power under Section 5(5), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution
to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure in all courts,
and by way of implementation of B.P. 129, issued Circular 1-91 prescribing the
rules governing appeals to the Court of Appeals from final orders or decisions
of the Court of Tax Appeals and quasi-judicial agencies to eliminate
unnecessary contradictions and confusing rules of procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioner's contention, although a circular is not
strictly a statute or law, it has, however, the force and effect of law
according to settled jurisprudence.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> In
Inciong v. de Guia,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
a circular of this Court was treated as law.  In adopting the recommendation of the Investigating Judge to impose a
sanction on a judge who violated Circular No. 7 of this Court dated September
23, 1974, as amended by Circular No. 3 dated April 24, 1975 and Circular No. 20
dated October 4, 1979, requiring raffling of cases, this Court quoted the
ratiocination of the Investigating Judge, brushing aside the contention of
respondent judge that assigning cases instead of raffling is a common practice
and holding that respondent could not go against the circular of this Court
until it is repealed or otherwise modified, as "(L)aws are repealed only
by subsequent ones, and their violation or non-observance shall not be excused
by disuse, or customs or practice to the contrary.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that Article 82 of E.O. 226 cannot be validly repealed
by Circular 1-91 because the former grants a substantive right which, under the
Constitution cannot be modified, diminished or increased by this Court in the
exercise of its rule-making powers is not entirely defensible as it seems.  Respondent correctly argued that Article 82
of E.O. 226 grants the right of appeal from decisions or final orders of the
BOI and in granting such right, it also provided where and in what manner such
appeal can be brought.  These latter
portions simply deal with procedural aspects which this Court has the power to
regulate by virtue of its constitutional rule-making powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Bustos v. Lucero<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
distinguished between rights created by a substantive law and those arising
from procedural law:</p>

<blockquote>"Substantive law creates substantive rights x x x.  Substantive rights is a term which includes
those rights which one enjoys under the legal system prior to the disturbance
of normal relations (60 C. J., 980).  Substantive law is that part of the law which creates, defines and
regulates rights, or which regulates rights and duties which give rise to a
cause of action, as opposed to adjective or remedial law, which prescribes the
method of enforcing rights or obtains a redress for their invasion.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the question of where and in what manner appeals from
decisions of the BOI should be brought pertains only to procedure or the method
of enforcing the substantive right to appeal granted by E.O. 226.  In other words, the right to appeal from
decisions or final orders of the BOI under E.O. 226 remains and continues to be
respected.  Circular 1-91 simply
transferred the venue of appeals from decisions of this agency to respondent
Court of Appeals and provided a different period of appeal, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>.,
fifteen (15) days from notice.  It did
not make an incursion into the substantive right to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that BOI is not expressly included in the list of
quasi-judicial agencies found in the third sentence of Section 1 of Circular
1-91 does not mean that said circular does not apply to appeals from final
orders or decision of the BOI.  The
second sentence of Section 1 thereof expressly states that "(T)hey shall
also apply to appeals from final orders or decisions of any quasi-judicial
agency from which an appeal is now allowed by statute to the Court of Appeals
or the Supreme Court." E.O. 226 is one such statute.  Besides, the enumeration is preceded by the
words "(A)mong these agencies are x x x," strongly implying that
there are other quasi-judicial agencies which are covered by the Circular but
which have not been expressly listed therein.  More importantly, BOI does not fall within the purview of the exclusions
listed in Section 2 of the circular.  Only the following final decisions and interlocutory orders are
expressly excluded from the circular, namely, those of:  (1) the National Labor Relations Commission;
(2) the Secretary of Labor and Employment; (3) the Central Board of Assessment
Appeals and (4) other quasi-judicial agencies from which no appeal to the
courts is prescribed or allowed by statute.  Since in DBP v. CA<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> we
upheld the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over the Court of Tax
Appeals despite the fact that the same is not among the agencies reorganized by
B.P. 129, on the ground that B.P. 129 is broad and comprehensive, there is no
reason why BOI should be excluded from Circular 1-91, which is but implementary
of said law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, Circular 1-91 effectively repealed or superseded Article
82 of E.O. 226 insofar as the manner and method of enforcing the right to
appeal from decisions of the BOI are concerned.  Appeals from decisions of the BOI, which by statute was
previously allowed to be filed directly with the Supreme Court, should now be
brought to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing reasons, the instant

merit.  The Temporary Restraining Order
