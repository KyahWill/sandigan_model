13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>this petition is whether the
decision of the former court of first instance, affirming the judgment of the

<p class="BODY">In a complaint<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed before the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, herein
private respondent, as plaintiff, sought the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of herein petitioners, as defendants, alleging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that plaintiff is the owner of two (2) parcels
of land, consisting of 302 square meters, located in <span class="SpellE">Lawa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; that
sometime in April, 1967, defendants occupied said parcels of land and built a
residential house and other improvements thereon on mere consent and tolerance
of herein plaintiff; that since April 11, 1970, plaintiff had demanded that
defendants vacate said premises, but defendants refused and failed to do so up
to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss<a style="mso-footnote-id:

alleging that they have been tenants of the aforesaid parcels of land since
1941 up to the present; that, as tenants, defendants are entitled to a <span class="SpellE">homelot</span> and they cannot be deprived of the same unless it
is decreed by a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision of a
competent court for causes provided by law; that there is a prejudicial
question as to whether or not a tenancy relationship exists between plaintiff
and defendants; and that this case falls within the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, pursuant to Section 154(1) of
Republic Act No. 1267.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff filed an opposition<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to the motion to dismiss stating that the subject matter of the action is a
residential lot and is not for cultivation; and that mere allegations that
there exists an agricultural tenancy relation between defendants and plaintiff
do not divest the municipal court of its jurisdiction to try the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case.</p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the municipal court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that there is nothing
in the allegations in the complaint which speaks of tenancy relationship
between the parties, and that since the allegations in the complaint determine
the jurisdiction of the courts, it properly acquired jurisdiction over the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants' motion for reconsideration of the order denying their motion
to dismiss was likewise denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, defendants filed their answer with counterclaim,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

alleging that since 1941 up to the present they have been occupying and
cultivating the parcels of land owned by plaintiff; that they have been tenants
of plaintiff since 1941 up to the present; that the question of whether or not
there exists a tenancy relation between the parties falls within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations; and that defendants have filed
a complaint for security of tenure before the Court of Agrarian Relations
docketed as CAR Case No. 362.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing and presentation of evidence by both parties,
herein petitioners again filed another motion to dismiss dated January 6, 1973,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

alleging that "(w)<span class="SpellE">hile</span> it is true that the
jurisdiction of the court in a suit for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> or
forcible entry is determined by the allegations in the complaint, yet where
tenancy is averred as a defense and, upon hearing, is shown to be the real
issue, the court should dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction."</p>

<p class="BODY">Without resolving this second motion to dismiss, the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span> rendered a decision, dated March 28,
1973,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

ordering the defendants to vacate the parcels of land in question; to pay
plaintiff a monthly rental thereon of P30.00 from September 7, 1970 until they
vacate the premises; and to pay attorney's fees in an amount equivalent to ten
percent (10%) of the total <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">amount of
rentals due to plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
Branch III, which rendered judgment on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">June 7, 1974</span></st1:date><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

except as to attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No appeal having been taken from this decision of the Court of
First Instance, upon motion of herein private respondent said court issued a
writ of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, before the
same could be implemented, petitioners filed a motion for referral of the case
to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, dated <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1974</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
After hearing the arguments of both parties, the Court of First Instance issued
an order, dated <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1974</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
denying the aforesaid motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
instant petition involves and assails the said denial order.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the motion to refer the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform was properly denied by respondent
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Section 8 of Republic Act
No. 3844, otherwise known as the Code of Agrarian Reforms, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 8.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Extinguishment
of Agricultural Leasehold Relation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-
The agricultural lease­hold relation established under this Code shall be
extinguished by:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"(2)
</span>Voluntary surrender of the landholding by the agricultural lessee,
written notice of which shall be served three months in advance;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners admit that they have voluntarily surrendered their
landholding to private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, they submit that they agreed to surrender their landholding on
the condition that the lot where their house is constructed will belong to
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This contention is bereft of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the law which
imposes a consideration, of whatever kind and nature, for the surrender by the
tenant of his landholding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What it
requires is a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">mere </span>written
notice in order that voluntary surrender will terminate the tenancy
relation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While there is jurisprudence
to the effect that Section 8 of Republic Act No. 3844 does not prohibit the
parties from attaching conditions to the agreement on the surrender of the
landholding by the tenant, we are convinced, on the basis of the evidence
presented by private respondent which is neither denied nor confirmed by
petitioners, that the alleged condition adverted to by petitioners was never
agreed upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show, and it is not disputed, that in a letter dated <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1970</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
private respondent advised petitioners that he is giving them thirty (30) days
from receipt thereof within which to elect whether or not to buy the parcel of
land occupied by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When petitioners
failed to reply, it was then that private respondent demanded that they vacate
the premises and pay the rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners likewise do not deny that they were allowed by private
respondent to purchase the lot adjoining that on which their house is
constructed, with the promise that they will transfer their house to the
adjoining lot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
We find no plausible reason why petitioners would still transfer their house to
the adjoining lot if it were true, as they claim, that the land on which their
house stands actually belongs to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The filing of the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> only
serves to strengthen the fact that the subject premises did not belong to
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there is sufficient
basis to conclude that petitioners had surrendered their landholding to herein
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that by the voluntary surrender of the landholding
the tenancy relationship, if any, was terminated, it follows that the land ceased
to be within the contemplation of Presidential Decree <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">No. </span>316.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
the mandatory provisions in Section 2 thereof, requiring referral of the case
to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, could no longer be invoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners argue that,
pursuant to Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 316, it is necessary for said
secretary to determine whether or not a tenancy relationship exists between the
parties herein, because it is only when said official finds that no such
relationship exists that the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case may
proceed for further proceedings in the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 316 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unless
certified by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform as a proper case for trial or
hearing by a court or judge or other officer of competent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">jurisdiction, no judge of the Court of
Agrarian Relations, Court of First Instance, municipal or city court, or any
other tribunal or fiscal shall take cognizance of any <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case or any other case designed to harass or remove a tenant of an agricultural
land primarily devoted to rice and corn, and if any such cases are filed, these
cases shall first be referred to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform or his
authorized representative in the locality for a preliminary determination of
the relationship between the contending parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the Secretary of Agrarian Reform finds
that the case is a proper case for the court or judge or other hearing officer
to hear, he shall so certify and such court, judge or other hearing officer may
assume jurisdiction over the dispute of controversy."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is readily apparent that the aforesaid provision applies only
if what is involved is agricultural land primarily devoted to rice and
corn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, it has been
sufficiently established by the evidence presented and the facts found, both in
the aforesaid Municipal Court and Court of First Instance, that the two parcels
of land on which petitioners' house is located are residential in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot, therefore, accept the theory advanced
by petitioners that the trial court can proceed to hear the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case filed before it only after the Secretary of Agrarian Reform has certified
that no tenancy relationship exists between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">arguendo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>that
the land is indeed agricultural, petitioners' submission must still fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1038, which is aimed at
strengthening the security of tenure of tenant-tillers in non-rice/corn
producing private agricultural lands, in conjunction with Section 2 of
Presidential Decree No. 316 hereinbefore quoted, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No judge of
the courts of agrarian relations, courts of first instance, city or municipal
courts, or any other tribunal or fiscal shall take <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

case designed to harass or remove a tenant of an agricultural land primarily </span>devoted
to rice and/or corn, unless <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">certified
by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform as a proper case for trial or hearing by a
court or judge or other officer of </span>competent jurisdiction and, if any
such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">case is filed, the case shall
first be referred to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform or his authorized
representative in the locality for a preliminary determination of the relationship
between the contending parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
Secretary of Agrarian Reform or his authorized representative in the locality
finds that the case is a proper case for the court or judge or other hearing
officer to hear, he shall so certify and such court, judge or other hearing
officer may assume jurisdiction over the dispute or controversy.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The preliminary determination of the relationship between the
contending parties by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, or his authorized
representative, is not binding upon the court, judge or hearing officer to whom
the case is certified as a proper case for trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said court, judge or hearing officer may,
after due hearing, confirm, reverse or modify said preliminary determination as
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">evidence and substantial merits of
the case may warrant."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

that:</p>

<blockquote>"Arguing on the merits of his petition for relief,
petitioner's main contention is that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not

 18, 1969</st1:date>, as well as the writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1972</st1:date> and the order of
demolition dated <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1972</st1:date>
issued to implement said decision, were all null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner, the case involves an
agrarian dispute and an established tenancy relationship between the parties,
hence, it should fall squarely within the original and exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
that the allegations of the Complaint filed by herein private respondents in
the court below (Civil Case No. SM-243) constitute a cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and damages against petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents, as complainants therein,
claimed ownership over the parcel of land in question identified as Lot No.
2604-B but which was allegedly in the possession of petitioner who had been
unlawfully depriving them of their right to possess the property for several
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, they filed an <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span>,

<blockquote>"Thus, in the case at bar, petitioner's defense of tenancy in
his Answer to private respondents' complaint did not automatically divest the
lower court, a court of first instance, of its jurisdiction over Civil Case No.

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that the above circular speaks of "actual
tiller" and "tenant-farmer." There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>no question that only a tenant may
avail of the beneficent provisions of Memorandum Circular No. 29.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential requisites set by law for a tenancy relationship
are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the parties are the landholder and the
tenant; (2) the subject is agricultural land; (3) the purpose is agricultural
production; and (4) there is consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is understood that there is consent to the tenant to work on the
land, there is personal cultivation by him and the consideration consists of
sharing the harvest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
All these requisites are necessary in order to create tenancy relationship
between the parties and the absence of one or more requisites does not make the
alleged tenant a <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

security of tenure.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering our earlier finding that the subject premises are
residential lands and, therefore, there is no tenancy relationship in this
case, the inescapable conclusion is that petitioners' claims must be rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Verily, even Memorandum Circular No. 29 finds
no proper application to the case at bar.</p>
