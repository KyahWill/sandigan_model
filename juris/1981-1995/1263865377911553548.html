Appeals dated August 5, 1980<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> in CA
G.R. No. 42461 -R entitled “Republic of the Philippines vs. Leon Bessire, et
al.”, affirming with modification the lower court's judgment dated April 30,
1968<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a> with respect to the payment of 12% interest per
annum and denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration dated October 6,
1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime after 1951, the Republic of the Philippines, thru its
Bureau of Internal Revenue, assessed the Bessire Housing Corporation (BESCO) in
the amount of P16,840.04 representing percentage taxes for the year 1951.  Apparently pressed for payment, the manager
thereof (Leon Bessire) executed in personal capacity on October 30, 1956, with
Mutual Security Insurance Corporation an "Ordinary Bond for Payment of
Taxes", known as MUSIC S-575-A, wherein the parties undertook to jointly
and severally pay the Republic the aforementioned assessment in twelve (12)
equal installments as scheduled therein.  On same day that the bond was posted Leon Bessire, Manila Surety and
Corazon Santos Escobar in her personal capacity and as attorney-in-fact of
Eduardo Escobar signed an indemnity agreement binding themselves solidarily to
indemnify Mutual Security for any damages losses it may sustain as a result of
its having consented to become a surety in favor of the Bureau of Internal Revenue
(BIR).  On December 28, 1936, Leon
Bessire paid the first installment of P1,403.34 due on November 30, 1956 and
another installment on a later date.  He
failed to pay the succeeding installments thus prompting the Commissioner of
the Internal Revenue to send a letter of February 20, 1958 that unless Mr.
Bessire paid P14,035.36 plus the accrued delinquency penalties within 15 days,
the bond would be forfeited.  A letter
of demand was also sent on the same date to Mutual Security.  (Rollo, p. 32-33; Petition, Annex A, pp.
2-3)</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 19, 1958, Atty. William H. Quasha as substitute for
Corazon Santos Escobar signed an Indemnity Agreement whereby he undertook to
jointly and severally with Leon Bessire and BESCO, indemnify Manila Surety for
any damage or loss it may suffer in consequence of its having consented to
continue being counter surety upon the indemnity agreement MUSIC S-575-A
(Rollo, p. 67; Comment, p. 2).  On July
18, 1958 the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue acknowledged the payment
by Leon Bessire of P300.00 and demanded the full payment of the balance of
P13,733.36 on or before July 31, 1958.  A letter of demand was also sent to Mutual Security <span style="">(R</span>ollo, pp. 33-34; Petition, Annex A,
pp. 3-4).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 31, 1958, Leon Bessire sent a check <span style="">for </span>P1,403.34 and asked for further
time to pay the outstanding balance in view of his financial difficulties.  On September 26, 1958, the Acting
Commissioner of Internal Revenue wrote Leon Bessire to pay the P12,330.02 in
full on or before October 15, 1958 and Mutual Security to do the same or steps
for the forfeiture of the bond would be taken (Rollo, p. 34; Petition, Annex A,
p. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Leon Bessire made further payments:  P400.00 on November 13, 1958; P500.00 on February 13, 1959;
P500.00 on May 12, 1959; and P500.00 on October 28, 1959.  On April 7, 1960, a letter of demand was
again sent to Leon Bessire giving him until April 30, 1960 to pay the balance
of P10,430.02 and a letter of substantially the same tenor to Mutual
Security.  <span style="">On June </span>12, 1961, Leon Bessire died.  (Rollo,<span style=""> pp.</span> 34-35;
Petition, Annex A<span style="">, </span>pp. 4-5)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 9, 1962, the
Republic of the Philippines upon the request of the BIR filed a complaint
against Leon Bessire and Mutual Security Insurance Corporation (Mutual), to
have the surety bond </span>guaranteeing the payment of percentage taxes
forfeited <span style="">and for the said defendants j</span><span style="">ointl</span><span style="">y</span><span style=""> and </span><span style="">severally to </span><span style="">pay </span><span style="">P10,032.02 plus interest
at the legal rate and costs (Rollo, p. 31).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On March 7, 1962, MutuaI
filed its answer with cross claim against Leon Bessire.  On July 5, 1963 it filed a third party
complaint against petitioner, Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. (Manila
Surety).  On July </span><span style="">26, 1</span><span style="">963, Manila Surety filed a fourth-party complaint against herein
private respondent, William H. Quasha (Rollo, p. 32; Petition, Annex A, p. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial<span style=""> </span>on the merits</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">the lower court,
through then Judge Luis B. Reyes, rendered its decision on April 30, 1968, the
dispositive portion of which </span>reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, judgment is rendered as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

date of the filing of the suit, until said amount is <span style="">fully </span>paid, and to pay the costs of this suit. </blockquote>

<blockquote>“The counterclaim of fourth party defendant is dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SO ORDERED.” (Rollo, p. 68).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mutual, Manila Surety and Quasha all file their respective
appeals to the respondent Court of Appeals which rendered judgment on March 21,
1980 affirming the judgment of the lower court (Petitioner’s brief, p. 4).  On April 17, 1980, William H. Quasha,
private respondent herein, filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the
aforementioned judgment alleging as the sole ground therefore that the
respondent Court of Appeals erred in affirming without modifying a portion of
the decision which ordered fourth party defendant appellant William H. Quasha
to pay and/or indemnify fourth party plaintiff appellant Manila Surety the
amount of judgment it is ordered to pay third party plaintiff appellant Mutual,
with interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum from Jul<span style="">y 3, 1963 until fully</span><span style=""> paid (P</span>etitioner’s <span style="">brief p. 4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

appears, this Court <span style="">h</span>eld:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The agreement herein sued upon is not only one of
indemnity against loss but of indemnity against liability.  While the first does not render the

<u>arises,</u> <u>irrespective</u> <u>of</u> <u>whether</u> <u>or</u> <u>not</u>
<u>he</u> <u>has</u> <u>suffered</u> <u>actual</u> <u>loss."</u>
(Underscoring ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The next question here is when did the liability of Manila Surety
in favor <span style="">of </span><span style="">Mutual </span>arise<span style=""> </span>so as to give rise to the correspondi<span style="">n</span>g liability on the part of Quasha vis-a-vis Manila Surety.  The Indemnity Agreement whereby Manila

provides:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ACCRUAL OF ACTION - Whe<span style="">re</span> <span style="">the obligation </span>involves

(Record on Appeal, p. 44) (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Clearly, the liability of Manila Surety
arose on July 5, 1963, <span style="">the </span>date
on which the third party complaint <span style="">was
filed </span>against it <span style="">by </span>Mutual,
which was the date of judicial demand, and from that point on, it had already
incurred liability, <span style="">thereby giving </span>rise
to the concommitant liability of<span style=""> </span>Quasha
under his indemnity agreement with Manila Surety.  Said indemnity agreement provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MATURITY OF THE OBLIGATION UNDER THIS
BOND:  Said indemnity shall be paid to

<p class="BODY">Interpreting a similar provision in an indemnity agreement, this
Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x In the indemnity agreement executed by appellant in
favor of appellee, there appears the following clause:  ‘Said indemnity shall be paid to the COMPANY
as <span style="">soon as </span>it has become liable
for the payment of any amount under the abovementioned bond, whether or not it
shall have paid <span style="">such sums </span>or <span style="">sums </span>of money or any part thereof.’ It
is <span style="">there said </span>that the liability
of appellee as bondsman would attach as soon as it has become liable for the
payment of any amount regardless <span style="">of </span>whether
said amount shall have been paid or not.  This is the situation that actually <span style="">obtains</span> <span style="">here.  The</span> NARIC, or its legal successor,
the Prisco, has <span style="">actually </span>filed an
action in court demanding payment of the obligation from appellee under the
bond <u>it</u> <u>has</u> <u>posted</u> <u>on</u> <u>behalf</u> <u>of</u> <u>both</u>
<u>Felicisima</u> <u>Policarpio</u> <u>and</u> <u>Hermina</u> <u><span style="">Cruz</span>,</u><span style=""> </span>which action is more than enough to entitle the appellee to
enforce the indemnity agreement executed by appellant.  This constitutes the cause of action of
appellee in the present case." (Manila <span style="">Surety &amp; </span>Fidelity Co. Inc. v. Teodulo Cruz, L-10414, April
18, 1958, 103 Phil. 367) (Underscoring ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In addition thereto, the indemnity agreement also provides:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INTEREST IN CASE OF DEFAULT:  And in case of nonpayment of the said sum or
sums of money, an interest of twelve (12%) per cent per annum, which interest,
while not paid, shall be liquidated and accumulated monthly to the capital owed
by the undersigned, drawing the same interest as <span style="">the </span>said capital." (Rollo, p. 56; Petition, Annex D, p. 78).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since respondent Q</span>uasha's
liability arose on July 5, 1963, the date the third party complaint was filed
and the same not having been paid, his liability to pay the 12% per cent
interest per annum, in case of default as stated in the aforementioned
indemnity agreement also arose.</p>

the principal obligation.  The increased
<span style="">liabilities is not because</span> of the
contract but because of the default and the necessity of judicial collection.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Elucidating further on the obligations of the parties <span style="">in </span>agreements of this nature, this
Court ruled:  "The indemnity agreement
was not executed for the benefit of the creditors; it was rather for the <span style="">benefit </span>of the surety and if the latter
thought it necessary <span style="">in </span>its own
interest to impose this stipulation, and the indemnitors voluntarily agreed to
the same, the court should respect the agreement of the parties and require
