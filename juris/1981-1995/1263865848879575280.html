				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of the Court of Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> dated <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1988</st1:date>, dismissing
petitioners' petition for <i>certiorari</i> and injunction with prayer for
temporary restraining order, and the resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1988</st1:date>, denying the motion for
reconsideration of said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue is whether or not the denial of the motion to
dismiss in this case is a proper subject for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on December 11, 1987, the private respondent
filed a complaint against the petitioners with the Regional Trial Court of
Manila, Branch 35, docketed as Civil Case No. 87-43109, for collection of
attorney's fees for legal services rendered to the latter in an expropriation
case and/or damages for breach of their written commitment that he shall act as
their counsel in all stages of the proceedings until its final determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records also show that plaintiff-respondent also filed
another Civil Case No. Q-39001, to recover alleged unpaid attorney's fees for
the supposed legal services he rendered to petitioners herein who were the
plaintiffs in Civil Case No. Q-­11180 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Ibanez <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Zuzuarregui</span>,
et al. v. Constitution Hills Development Corporation, et al." for quieting
of title thru cancellation of falsified and derivative titles with damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 19, 1988, the petitioners filed a motion to dismiss
the latter complaint on the following grounds:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that the complaint does not state a cause of action; (2) that the
filing of the present complaint violates the rule on splitting of a cause of
action; and (3) that the present action is barred by the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of another action between the parties for the same cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1988</st1:date>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>trial court issued an order denying
said motion to dismiss, the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Although <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of causes of
action in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">one complaint, </span>if
permissible, should be encouraged, for it promotes the policy on avoiding
multiplicity of suits, plaintiff, however, is not obligated to do so and he
could always file separate actions for each cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subject to the exceptions enumerated in
Section 5 of Rule 2 of the Revised Rules of Court, where a plaintiff has
several causes of action against the same defendant, he may join them all in a
single complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of causes of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">action
is not compulsory, but merely </span>permissive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Moran, Rules of Court, Vol. I, 1979 Ed., p.
143; <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, Remedial Law Compendium, Vol. I, 4th
Rev. Ed., p. 43).</p>

<p class="XXX" style="text-align:center;tab-stops:-171.0pt 0in .3in 2.0in 3.7in" align="center">xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<p class="2Q">“"In (sic) relief prayed for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">in </span>the case at bar and the relied prayed for in Civil Case No.
Q-39001 are founded on entirely different facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attorney's fees which plaintiff seeks to
recover from the defendants in the present case are for the legal services the
former rendered to the latter in Special Civil Case No. 26804, an expropriation
proceeding instituted by the National Housing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Authority over the properties of said </span>defendants in <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The relief prayed for is based on the alleged
breach by the defendants of their written commitment to the plaintiff to retain
his professional services until the final determination of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">expropriation case; however, without </span>justifiable
cause they terminated his professional services (sic) the expropriation case
has been finally determined.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On the other hand, the attorney's fees sought by the
plaintiff in Civil Case No. 39001 are for the legal services he rendered to the
defendants as plaintiffs in Civil Case No. Q-11180 to quiet their title over
Lots Nos. 827 and 830 situated in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city>, and to cancel the falsified and derivative
titles secured by other persons over those lots, with damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The relief prayed for in that case was based
on quantum <span class="SpellE">meruit</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>, therefore, of Civil
Case No. 39001 before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City will not lie to sustain the dismissal of the present action." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 133-134).</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of this order filed by the
petitioners was likewise denied on <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="5">May
 31, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1988</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed in the Court of Appeals a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
to annul the orders of <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1988</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1988</st1:date> of the
respondent Judge with a prayer for the issuance of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a </span>temporary restraining order to enjoin the respondent Judge
from enforcing the questioned orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals, holding that the trial court correctly denied
petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint, rendered its decision dismissing
the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their motion for reconsideration was also
denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:58.5pt">On <st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1989</st1:date>, the Court gave due course to the petition
and required the parties to submit simultaneously their respective memoranda
within thirty (30) days from notice (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p. </span>189).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners submitted their memorandum on
<st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1989</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 192), while the private respondent submitted his
on <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1989</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 218).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent asserts that the order of the respondent
Judge denying petitioners' motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 41 of the Rules
of Court, when a motion to dismiss is denied, the proper procedure to be followed
by the dissatisfied <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is not to appeal from the
order of denial but to answer the complaint and go to trial until final
judgment is rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only exception
to this general rule is when the trial court has no jurisdiction over the case
or committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court in this case did not commit
grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did
the Court of Appeals act capriciously or whimsically in sustaining the order of
denial of the motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that an order denying a motion to dismiss is
interlocutory and cannot be the subject of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> (<span class="SpellE">Leynes</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and the
Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. 86392, January 19, 1989, <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>,
Minute Resolution).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show
that both the trial court and the appellate court were in accord with the facts
and the law when they denied the motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there was no grave abuse of discretion
committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, in a recent case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Tugade</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> <u>v.</u></span> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Appeals,</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> </span><u>et</u> <u>al.</u>, G.R. No. 86022, February 27, 1989, First
Division, Minute Resolution, which in effect is a reiteration of consistent
rulings of this Court, it was held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"The Court of Appeals properly dismissed said petition, not
only for <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, but also because, as a general rule,
the denial of a motion to dismiss, which is an interlocutory order, is not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by <i>certiorari</i> (Prudential Bank &amp;
Trust Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, et al., 105 Phil. 791; <span class="SpellE">Sapul</span> vs. Siva, 106 Phil. 73; Phil. International Fair,
Inc. vs. Ibanez, 94 Phil. 424).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's remedy is to reiterate the grounds of his motion to
dismiss, as defenses in his answer to the complaint, proceed to trial, and, in
case of an adverse decision, appeal the decision in due time (Harrison Foundry
Machinery Co. vs. Harrison Foundry Workers' Association, 8 SCRA 430).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The existence of that adequate remedy removed
the underpinnings of his petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Court of Appeals
(Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellate court did not err in dismissing the petition."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is hereby DISMISSED <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>lack of merit and the assailed
decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
