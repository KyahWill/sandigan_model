<p class="BODY">In May, 1984, after petitioner laid off <span style="">its medical personnel, private respondent </span>offered her services to
the petitioner to continue operating its medical services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her offer was accepted but she was made <span style="">to </span>absorb the dismissed personnel, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Javellonar</span> as radiologist,
<span style="">Dr. </span>Rene <span class="SpellE">Eclavea</span>
<span style="">as </span>dentist and Dr. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Balgos</span> as internist.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1984</st1:date>, sent by the petitioner's assistant regional manager to
private respondent, she was instructed that only Dr. <span class="SpellE">Javellonar</span>

with the proper equipment and the only one authorized to read the x-ray films.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> She </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">also made to

nurses and technologists were asked to clear up the mess </span>in the medical
records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On two occasions, they sent her
confidential memoranda to inform her about the problems in the job site in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Saudi
  Arabia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At one instance, they made her nurses fetch one of their patients from
the airport.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was given <span style="">a </span>memorandum of <span style="">the </span>office hours that her personnel <span style="">have </span>to observe.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
A memorandum was also sent to <span style="">her </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the proper guidance of her personnel in vaccinating workers and
authority to perform </span>a <span style="">complete
medical check up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was based at the
petitioner's medical complex </span>located at <st1:street><st1:address>Shaw
  Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She treated the petitioner's employees and

occasion to treat Mr. Rico <span class="SpellE">Iconomoff</span>, <span style="">its </span>president.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1984</st1:date>,
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Iconomoff</span> called a meeting attended by him, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gabaldon</span> and private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He discussed with them plans to open up a
medical complex <span style="">beside the </span>pre-employment
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">also intended to put up </span>a dispensary or a hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked her to prepare a budget indicating
how much it would cost to operate the whole complex which she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it occurred to him to change the name of
"Phil-Dumez" medical clinic to <span style="">"Spectrum,"
the name of her own medical clinic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next
day, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Iconomoff</span> called her to apply for a change

proceeded to the municipal hall of <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> for
that purpose with a letter requesting for a change of name and paid the

after the medical clinic had been set up and had been running smoothly, she
received a letter from the petitioner terminating its agreement with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was shocked and as a result of which she
was confined in bed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, she filed a complaint for damages in the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City wherein after the issues were

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first issue of jurisdiction, it is true that the
evidence tends to show that the private respondent was not a mere medical
retainer but was practically a part of <span style="">the
management of the petitioner, wherein her employees are </span>under the
control and supervision of the management and had to work within the hours set
by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had to absorb the
radiologist and dentist in her medical clinic whether she liked it <span style="">or </span>not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was also given <span style="">instructions
on how medical examinations should be performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her personnel were required to observe the
usual working hours set for its employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's employees were treated by her and her staff, her nurses and
</span>technologists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was also made
to participate in the computerization of petitioner's medical records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Her </span>nurses
and technologists were asked to clear up the mess from among said records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Memoranda were sent to her concerning
petitioner's operations in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Saudi Arabia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name of her own medical clinic,
"Spectrum Laboratory" was adopted by petitioner as its own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these show that she was under the
petitioner's control which indicates the existence of the employer-employee
relationship.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, it appears from the records that private respondent is
suing petitioner for damages caused <span style="">by </span>its
<span class="SpellE">tortious</span> act of terminating private responde<span style="">n</span>t’s services for no reason at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This suit falls under the <span style="">jurisdiction of the regular courts whereby
private respondent claims that </span><span style="">petitioner
</span><span style="">had oppressively and illegally
dismissed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Her cl</span><span style="">aim does not involve </span>her <span style="">hours
of work, the terms and conditions of employment, </span>non-payment or
underpayment of wages, overtime compensation, separation pay, and other
benefits provided by law or appropriate agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is the regular <span style="">court that has jurisdiction over the case and
not the Department of Labor and Employment or National Labor Relations Commission.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Moreover, when as in this case the extent of
the employer-employee relationship is disputed, it is the courts that have
jurisdiction over the case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The contention therefore of petitioner that the Regional Trial Court has no
jurisdiction over the case is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">And even assuming that the claim of petitioner that private
respondent as a medical retainer was an independent contractor, the fact
remains that the services of private <span style="">respondent
were unceremoniously terminated without justifiable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a clear breach of contract
entitling private respondent to damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question of illegal termination of the services of the
private respondent and the damages suffered by her are factual issues for the
determination of the appellate court the findings of which are conclusive in
this proceeding and are not to be disturbed in this appeal unless it is shown
it has been arbitrarily arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has not shown a cogent basis for this Court to depart from
this rule.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b><span style=""> </span>the
petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit with costs against petitioner.</p>
