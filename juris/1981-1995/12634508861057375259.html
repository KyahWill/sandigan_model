affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the judgment of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Circuit</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Criminal</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in Criminal Case No. CCC-XIV-613-Cebu which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Shem <span class="SpellE">Jakosalem</span> GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
Robbery with Homicide and applying the provisions of Article 294, paragraph 1
of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no mitigating nor aggravating
circumstance present in connection with the crime charged, the accused is
hereby sen­tenced to suffer the penalty of <u>RECLUSION</u> <u><span style="">PERPETUA,</span></u><span style=""> to indemnify Aurora Ira the sum of P160, 000. 00 for the lost of money
and other valuables and for the death of <span class="SpellE">Cristituto</span> [<span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>] Ira to pay the heirs the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> with one-fourth of the costs."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the decision, <span class="GramE">We</span> said, among other
things, the following;</p>

<blockquote>"The appellant claims that evidence not available at the trial
was later discovered to the effect that it was not <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ababon</span> who drove the get-away taxi but one Sergio <span class="SpellE">Carampotan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies
of clippings from the "Morning Times" of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
dated November 8 and 4, 1972, marked as Annexes "A" and "B"
were sub­mitted as the 'newly discovered evidence.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say, the clippings are hearsay
and have no evidentiary value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the 'newly discovered evidence' of November 8 and 4, 1972, should have been
immediately utilized as a possible basis for a new trial since the judgment
under appeal had not yet become final instead of submitting it as a ground for
acquittal in a brief dated May 20, 1974."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Taking a cue from <span class="GramE">Our</span> statement the
defendant-appellant filed a motion for new trial based on newly discovered
evidence on <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We required the Solicitor General to comment
and he has submitted the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant anchors his motion for reconsideration and/or new
trial on newly discovered evidence on the broad ground of substantial justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant cites peculiar circumstances obtaining in his case
as exceptional so as to allegedly warrant a new trial if only to afford him the
opportunity to establish his innocence of the crime charged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus - sometime in November 1972, or two (2) months after
appellant's conviction by the Circuit Criminal Court on <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1972</st1:date>, the PC-CIS apprehended a gang of
robbers (Annexes "A" and "B", Appellant's Brief).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1972</st1:date>,

later on she identified ap­pellants as one of the robbers with the explanation
that when appellant was brought to her, she was afraid to identify him because
she had no confidence in the per­son of Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Gacho</span> (p. 12, SC decision).</blockquote>
