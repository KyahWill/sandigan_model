<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence upon which the trial court based the
conviction of the accused is summarized in its decision as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about midnight of May 7, 1979, upon the report of <span class="SpellE">Edita</span> <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>, a daughter of the
victim, Sgt. Juan <span class="SpellE">Serquina</span> and Sgt. Socrates of the
151st PC Company in <span class="SpellE">Tayug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
went to <span class="SpellE">Barangobong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to investigate the death of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> whom they found lying dead in a creek, his face down,
with multiple hack wounds all over his body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They made inquiries from the persons around regarding the identities of
his assailants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A bystander, <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagio</span>, volunteered the
information that the assailants were "the <span class="SpellE">Rillortas</span>,
father and sons" (pp. 83-84, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1980</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Serquina</span> went to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Rillortas</span> across the creek and called the name of the
accused <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span> who came out and surrendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>bolo with
a sharp-pointed tip (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As</span> he did not believe that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>the only weapon that the killers
used in the commission of the crime, <span class="SpellE">Serquina</span> and his
companions searched the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt.
Socrates recovered another bolo with a rounded tip (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
D) <span class="GramE">tucked</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the roof of the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">After removing the cadaver of the victim from the water and
taking pictures, the PC officers took <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span> and his son,
Wesley, to the PC Headquarters where the latter (Wesley), after being apprised
of his constitutional rights, gave a written statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
E) <span class="GramE">admitting</span> that he hacked the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Rural Health Physician, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span>, who autopsied
the cadaver, found thirty-two (32) bolo wounds on the victim's head, neck,
abdomen and arms.</p>

<p class="BODY">A prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> Ramos, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>thresher operator, recounted that
while they were threshing the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> stock near the
premises of the victim, the accused <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span> accosted Ramos
and threatened him with a gun saying "Damn you, you better go home or I'll
kill you here" (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., December 19,
1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>
resented the threshing of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in his barrio by the
Ramos' threshing party, whom he regarded <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>"outsiders," because he wanted the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
stocks in his barrio to be threshed in his own thresher.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On their way home to Bo.</span> <span class="SpellE">Calapugan</span>, Ramos and his companions, <span class="SpellE">Romy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elizaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Facon</span>, aboard their thresher, were stopped by the three
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>, who was armed with a bolo, warned them not
to return to thresh <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in barrio <span class="SpellE">Barangobong</span>. <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>, who was following behind Ramos' group, advised the
accused to let the threshing party pass.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The three <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(3) </span>accused
chased <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon overtaking him, they surrounded him and pushed him toward the
creek.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span> hacked him with a bolo while his sons
(co-accused Wesley and Wilson) held <span class="SpellE">Doton's</span>
hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Doton</span>
yelled "I'm going to <span class="GramE">die,</span> they are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">going to kill me." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Patayendacon</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>
denied having killed <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that the deceased attacked
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For his part, Wesley alleged that
he simply defended his father who was attacked by <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> testified that when <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> accosted them for having stopped Ramos' thresher,
they explained that they merely asked Ramos not to thresh in their barrio
because he (<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>) could do the threshing; that <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> allegedly answered "why, are you better than
I?" Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> allegedly replied "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span>, you know that I am hard up, why still get another
thresher?" <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> allegedly became angry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly drew his bolo from its scabbard
and hacked <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> allegedly parried the bolo
with his hands injuring his right and left little fingers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Doton</span> allegedly
chased <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> who crossed the foot bridge towards
his home to get a weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Just when <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> was about to hack <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
Wesley hacked <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> on the back and when he turned his
face, Wesley hacked him again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
allegedly wrestled and fell into the creek.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Each <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">time <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>
rose from the creek, Wesley hacked him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Pascual</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> could not recall how many times and on what
parts of the body, <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> was wounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the early dawn of <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1979</st1:date>,
he treated <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>
for a superficial cut on the tip of the right small (ring) finger and another
cut in the proximal third of the left finger, severing the bone.</p>

<p class="BODY">Wilson <span class="SpellE">Rillorta's</span> defense was an
alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that on the night in
question, he went to <span class="SpellE">Tayug</span> with one <span class="SpellE">Rogel</span> to bring a tractor tire for vulcanizing at Fred's
shop, arriving there around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
that evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He left the tire at the
shop to take supper with <span class="SpellE">Rogel</span> in the restaurant of
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Santillon</span> in the public market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After 30 minutes, they returned to the
vulcanizing shop and waited for the repair of the tire which was finished
around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00</st1:time>; after that they went
home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he arrived home, he found his
father <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>
with an injured hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, the PC and
policemen arrived and they took his father and his brother Wesley, but left him
behind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Santillon</span>
confirmed that he served to Wilson and his companions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">tireman</span>, Victor
<span class="SpellE">Camisola</span>, admitted that he repaired a tire for <st1:city><st1:place>Wilson</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>evidenced

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In their present appeal,
the accused allege that the trial court erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. in finding that treachery attended the commission of the
crime;</p>

<p class="BODY">2. <span class="GramE">in</span> finding that the deceased was

when attacked;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3. <span class="GramE">in</span> finding that the motive for the

resentment against the Ramos threshing party from <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>;</p>

<p class="BODY">4. in not finding that Wesley <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>
acted in legitimate defense of his father;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">5. in not finding that Wilson <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>

<p class="BODY">6. <span class="GramE">in</span> finding that the finger wounds of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span> were self-inflicted;
and</p>

<p class="BODY">7. <span class="GramE">in</span> giving more credit to the
witnesses for the prosecution instead of the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error is meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assault upon the deceased was not
attended by treachery for it was preceded by a heated exchange of words between
the appellants and the deceased (People vs. Ibanez, 56 SCRA 210; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Quiban</span>, 131 SCRA 459; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Visagar</span>,
93 Phil. 319).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said that
the deceased was caught completely by surprise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">when the accused took up arms against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the killing was only homicide
under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, not murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But the crime was a complex one of homicide with assault upon a
person in authority under Articles 249 and 148 of the Revised Penal Code in
view of the circumstance that when <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> intervened
to prevent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>violent encounter between the accused and Ramos' group (pp. 12, 14 &amp;

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Rillorta</span>
admitted his resentment against the deceased which motivated the assault
against the latter:</p>

why I have been crying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I even told to
