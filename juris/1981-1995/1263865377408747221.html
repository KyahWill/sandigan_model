of the eight normal schools established in the Philippines as a
teacher-training institution serving Eastern <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, became
a chartered state college by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 944 dated June
14, 1976 (72 O.G. 7207).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4 of
the decree provides that "the governance and administration of each
College and the exercise of its corporate powers shall be vested exclusively in
the Board of Trustees and in the President of the College insofar as authorized
by said Board".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to<span style=""> </span>its general powers of administration,
Section 6 provides that the Board shall have the power and duty:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To <u><span style="">appoint,</span></u><span style=""> </span>on recommendation of the President of
each College, a Vice-<span style="">President for

of the College and who shall automatically assume the presidency of the College
in an acting capacity, with full powers and duties, in the absence of the
President or when the office of the president is vacant." (Underscoring

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Under Section 9 of the same decree,
the vice-president for academic affairs shall also be a member of the College
Council which is vested with the powers to prescribe the curricula <span style="">and </span>the rules of discipline subject to
the approval <span style="">of the </span>Board of
Trustees; to fix the requirements for admission to the college as well as for
graduation and the receiving of a degree; to recommend students or others to be
the recipients of degree or honors; and, through its <span style="">president or </span>committee, to have disciplinary control over the

boards of chartered state universities and colleges and the term of office of

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">One of the governing board's specific

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">As petitioner was then holding an
appointment of Professor 6, the president of the college sought clarification
from the Minister of the Budget on the total compensation of the
vice-president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then Minister of
Budget, Manuel S. Alba, in a letter dated June 22, 1984, opined that "(p)<span class="SpellE">ursuant</span> to Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of NCC No. 12-B, <span style="">a </span>Vice-President may be designated in
lieu of a permanent <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> position, provided that
the designee's basic salary plus honorarium shall not exceed the salary
prescribed for a permanently appointed Vice-President, <span style="">as </span>specified by NCC No. 12".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the total compensation of petitioner
should consist of the basic salary of P41,292 and an honorarium of P4,548 or the
total amount of P45,840.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to
that amount, the vice-president was authorized to receive commutable

revamp in the composition of the Board of Trustees of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
State College.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among others, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span> M. Flores was designated officer-in-charge and

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Anticipating moves to replace her as

a position paper<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> asserting that the Board could
not appoint a vice-president because the position was not vacant, the

of the recommending president who had retired, and the incumbent was not

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Alleging that the appointment of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Crescencia</span> (<span class="SpellE">Cres</span>) V. Chan-<span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> to the position of vice-president in effect eased
her out of <span style="">said </span>position,
petitioner filed before the Board a petition for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She contended that her constitutional <span style="">and legal </span>rights to security of tenure
had been violated.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In response thereto, the Board Secretary informed petitioner's counsel through
a letter dated October 29, 1986 that her petition <span style="">was "noted </span>and discussed" by the Board but that the
members present at the meeting, namely, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> <span class="SpellE">Sutaria</span>, Dr. Flores <span style="">and
</span>Director <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baclagon</span>,
arrived at the consensus that the position of vice-president being
"honorific", the incumbent president of the college had the
prerogative to recommend for the vice-presidency the nominee of the executive
council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter added that the
position being "considered co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span> with
that of the President of the college", pursuant to Executive Order No. 17,
petitioner's services as vice-president were in effect terminated with the
Board's approval of the appointment of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> to
said position.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">From November 26, 1986 to January 7,
1987, petitioner's counsel wrote three letters to the secretary of the Board
and a letter to President Flores herself, all requesting for official copies of
the board resolution terminating the services of petitioner as college
vice-president, the board resolution appointing Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>
as vice-president, and the board resolution or decision denying petitioner's
petition for reconsideration, for the purpose of <span style="">filing </span>an appeal to the Minister of
Justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">On <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1987</st1:date>, petitioner interposed <span style="">an </span>appeal
despite non-receipt of the requested documents, to the Review Committee of the
Ministry of Justice which was organized to implement Executive Order No. 17
prescribing rules and regulations for the implementation of Section 2, Article
III of the Freedom Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
alleged therein that since her ouster as vice-president, she had been demoted
to the position of Director of Research and that the 20% salary increase
granted to all academic personnel of government schools was n<span style="">ot gi</span>ven to her because under the <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> approved by the Office of Budget and Management,
her salary was reduced by one step since she was no longer the college
vice-president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She argued that she <span style="">was </span>terminated and stripped of her
rank and status without legal cause and <span style="">due
</span>process; that the Board's claim that the position of vice-president is
"honorific" is not supported by law; that said position is not co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span> with the position of president <span style="">not </span><span style="">only </span>because the charter is silent on the matter but also
because the charter provides that <span style="">a </span>vice-president
automatically assumes the presidency when it is vacant; and that the Board <span style="">may </span>not designate or appoint anyone to
position of vice-president as the same was not vacant.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">The therein respondent Board not
having filed any responsive pleading to the brief filed <span style="">by </span>petitioner before <span style="">the Review Committee, she filed three
successive motions for </span>judgment on the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out, however, that on <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1987</st1:date>, the R<span style="">eview </span><span style="">Committee</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style=""> had issued a resolution on petitione</span>r<span style="">'s appeal but a copy </span>of the same <span style="">was furnished her through the mail only o</span>n

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">As <span style="">we </span>earlier held, exhaustion of administrative remedies is not an
iron-clad rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary
when, from the facts of the case, petitioner has to look to the cou<span style="">r</span>ts <span style="">for </span>speedy relief; when the <span style="">question presented is </span>"purely a legal one", <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>

thereby creating the impression that the same was filed under Rule 45 of the

vice-presidency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They aver, that petitioner's
"designation" to said position was "purely an internal
arrangement which does not require the approval or confirmation by the Civil
Service Commission".<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
They maintain that petitioner's term of office being co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span>
with that of the retired college president, petitioner may not complain that
she was <span style="">illegally
</span>dismissed from the vice-presidency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, petitioner asserts that she was the duly appointed
vice-president of the college and hence, her right to security of tenure may not
be unceremoniously abridged.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Borromeo</u></span><u>
v. Mariano</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court, through Justice Malcolm,
noted that "(a)<span class="SpellE">ll</span> authorities unite in saying
that the term 'appoint' is well-known and whether regarded in its legal or <span style="">in </span><span style="">its </span>ordinary
acceptation, is applied to the nomination or designation of an
individual." We defined "appointment" in <span class="SpellE"><u>Aparri</u></span><u>

as the "act of designation by the executive officer, board or body, to
whom that power has been delegated, of the individual who is to exercise the
functions of a given office." On the other hand, there is jurisprudence to
the effect that the word "designate", when used by the appointing
power in making an appointment to office, is equivalent to the word
"appoint".<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Common usage, however, oftentimes
puts a distinction between the terms "appointment" and
"designation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps, the
reason for this is that the word "appointment" connotes <span style="">permanency </span>while
"designation" implies temporariness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, to "designate" a public office to another position may
mean to vest him with additional duties while he performs the functions of his
permanent office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, in some cases, <span style="">a </span>public officer may be
"designated" to a position in an acting capacity as when an
Undersecretary is designated to discharge the functions of a Secretary pending
the <span style="">appointment of </span>a permanent
Secretary.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">The provisions of Presidential
Decrees Nos. 944 and 1437, specifically the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
sections, contemplate of a duly appointed vice-president by the Board of
Trustees, who would be a working vice-president with full powers and duties and
whose compensation, hours of service and other duties and conditions of
employment should be set by said Board.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Thus, P.D. 1437 specifically provides
among others, the following:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 3 x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> the governing board shall have the following
specific powers and duties:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">x</span> in accordance with the provisions of existing laws;
to remove them for cause<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after
investigation and hearing."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">It appears that these provisions of
law notwithstanding, it was not until <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="2">February
 3, 1984</st1:date> that a Vice-President for <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
State College was named with the designation of herein petitioner to said
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mode of authorization was
by "designation" inasmuch as the position of Vice-President did not
appear in the College's Personnel Services Itemization for<span style=""> the </span><span style="">year </span>1984.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
This omission was, however, corrected in the <span class="SpellE">Plantilla</span>
of Personnel and Salary Adjustment Form of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
State College for the same calendar year 1984, which listed as Item No. 2-1 the
position of "Professor 6 (Vic-President)".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein petitioner was listed <span style="">as </span>the incumbent with <span style="">an </span>actual salary as of <st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1984</st1:date> of P45,600.00 per annum

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="12"><span style="">December 27, </span>1985</st1:date>,
herein petitioner was extended an appointment as "Professor 6" <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>"with compensation at the rate of FIFTY FIVE
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY FOUR (P55,644) ONLY <span style="">pesos per </span>annum effective July 01, 1984." The position to be
filled was listed as "Old Item No. 2-1 Page 1 <span class="SpellE">Approp</span>.
Act 230 Page CY 1983, New Item No. 2-1 Page 1 <span class="SpellE">Approp</span>.
Act (Illegible) CY 1984", which is equivalent to the item designated as
"Professor 6 <span style="">(Vice-</span>President)"
in the <span class="SpellE">Plantilla</span> of Personnel for 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said appointment was issued "By
authority <span style="">of </span>the Board of
Trustees" and approved by the Civil Service Commission as permanent.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">From the foregoing, it becomes clear
that while initially petitioner was discharging the powers and functions of
Vice-President upon a designation <span style="">made
on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1984</st1:date>,
by July 1 <span style="">of the </span>same year, she
was doing so by virtue of <span style="">an </span>appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while her appointment paper mentioned
only "Professor 6" as the position <span style="">to </span>which <span style="">she was </span>being
appointed, <span style="">the </span>clear intent to
appoint her "Professor 6 (Vice-President)", <span style="">as </span><span style="">distinguished </span><span style="">from the other Professor 6 items </span><span style="">is </span>manifest
from the rate of compensation and Item Number specifically given in the
appointment paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there
appears no reason why she should be <span style="">given
</span>another appointment to the position of Professor 6 if the intention was
for her to remain merely as Professor 6.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only plausible explanation is that it was an appointment to a new <span style="">item </span>of Vice-President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as adverted to earlier, said appointment
was approved by the Civil Service <span style="">Commission
as permanent.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Although under <span style="">Section 8 of P.D. 1437, the term of a </span>state
college president <span style="">is </span>six (6)
years, the same law is silent as to that of the vice-president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such silence, however, should not be
interpreted to mean that the <span style="">law </span>intends to give the vice-president the same term as that of
a president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, there are
indications in the decrees themselves that the vice-president <span style="">is a career </span>official
whose term of office may outlast that of the president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under Section 6(c) of <span style="">P.D. 944, </span>the
vice-president is next in rank to the president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He or she shall assist the president in the
administration and supervision of the college.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He or <span style="">she </span>shall
"assume the presidency of the College in an acting capacity, with full
powers and duties in the absence or when <span style="">the
</span>office of the president is vacant".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whoever is holding the position of vice?president <span style="">shall </span>remain as such until, under
Section 3(f) of P.D. 1437 above-quoted, the Board finds a reason or reasons to
remove him "for cause after investigation and hearing".<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">The contention of respondents <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> <span style="">and </span>Flores
that petitioner was not a permanently appointed vice-president since she was
merely receiving <span style="">an </span>honorarium
for the job, is likewise without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the same Section 3(f) of P.D. 1437, the Board has the power to fix
the compensation of the vice-president.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, during its <span style="">meeting on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1984</st1:date>, the Board set petitioner's <span style="">basic salary as vice-president at P39,288
plus </span>representation and transportation allowances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since petitioner was then holding an
appointment as Professor 6, the then college president sought the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> opinion of the Minister of Budget granting
petitioner an honorarium of P4,548.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
inquiry, it must be noted, was done <span style="">in </span>connection
with Resolution No. 5, s. <span style="">1984, or while </span><span style="">p</span>etitioner
was discharging the functions of Vice-P<span style="">resident upon </span>a designation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, her compensation as <span style="">Professor 6 (Vice-President) was </span>specifically
stated in her appointment paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
allegation of private respondents that petitioner was receiving only an
honorarium and not a regular salary as Vice-President is therefore true only
for the period <span style="">February 3 </span>to
June 30, 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, by virtue of
her appointment, petitioner began receiving a compensation of P55,644.00 per
annum as Professor 6 (Vice-President).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;"><span class="SpellE">Mechem</span>
states that "(l)<span class="SpellE">ike</span> the requirement of an oath,

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">In the case at bar, petitioner having
been given the compensation attached to the Item Professor 6 (Vice-President)
as distinguished from the other Professor 6 items which carried a lower salary,
we hold that her appointment dated December 27, 1985, but retroactive to July
1, 1984 was in truth and in fact to the position of Vice-President, rather than
to the position of Professor 6.</p>

</span>In said case, there was no statutory basis for <span style="">the </span>inclusion of the position of Director of Publications in the <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> of the college as <span style="">it was </span>merely created by the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the position of
vice-president is based on a presidential decree which has the force and effect

omitted in the personnel services itemization, the college could do no more
than classify petitioner's petition as "Professor 6 (Vice-Pres.)".</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Petitioner learned of her removal as
vice-president when it was already a <u>fait accompli</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, all she could do under the
circumstances was to petition for the reconsideration of the Board resolution
designating respondent <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> as her replacement and
at the same time <span style="">asserting her </span>constitutional
right to security of tenure.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">The Board's "noting" of her

Although <span style="">the </span>Board Secretary's
letter stating that the petition for reconsideration was noted and discussed by
the Board, the latter's reason for replacing petitioner, to wit, the position
of vice-president is "honorific" and co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span>
with that of the college president is not within the purview of Section 3 <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">Furthermore, respondent Flores and
the Board had not complied with the procedure set forth in Section 2 of
Executive Order No. 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not
serve the notice of separation specified therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the cavalier manner by which
petitioner was dislodged from the vice-presidency was matched by the college

within the spirit of Executive Order No. 17 to brush aside its due process
requirements just to implement its ultimate purpose which is to rid the
government of misfits.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1in;">On top of these, the review committee
seems to have been too technical in treating petitioner's appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its denial of petitioner's plea for
reconsideration on the ground that the 10-day period specified in Section 6 of
said order had lapsed is tantamount to abuse of discretion it appearing that
said period had not commenced to run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
agree with the Solicitor General that the letters embodying the resolutions
replacing petitioner as vice-president, do not, in legal contemplation,
constitute the notice of separation <span style="">from
