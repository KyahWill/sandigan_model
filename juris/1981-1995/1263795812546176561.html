Ernesto Lazaro, and Vivencio Lopez (three of whom are respondents herein), to

Pena, <st1:city><st1:place>Marikina</st1:place></st1:city>, Rizal.</p>

defendants through Atty. Roldan asked for another extension of ten (10) days to

<p class="BODY">On 3 November 1976, the respondents, through their new counsel,
Atty. Oliver Lozano, filed with the same court an omnibus motion, which
included a motion to lift the order of default, a second motion for
reconsideration and a motion to quash the writ of execution issued pursuant to
the default judgment, alleging for the first time that their failure to answer <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>due to lack of notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner opposed vigorously the above motion contending that,
the defendants could not pretend absence of proper notice after they, through
counsel, had filed the two motions for extension of time to answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="12">27 December 1976</st1:date>,
the lower court denied the omnibus motion, holding the motion for extension of
time to vacate filed by respondent Romeo Lazaro for all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">defendants </span>to be equivalent to waiver
of service of summons.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 January 1977, defendants, through their new counsel, filed
what in effect was a third mo<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ti</span>on
for reconsideration of the j<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">u</span>dgment
by default, alleging that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the lower
court never acquired jurisdiction over their persons because of lack of proper
service of summons:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and that the motion
for extension of time to vacate the premises, filed by their co-defendant Romeo
Lazaro, after the judgment by default had become executory, was not equivalent
to waiver of summons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third motion for reconsideration having been denied,
defendants brought a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of A<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">p</span>peals, asserting that the orders,
judgment and writs complained of were all void for want of jurisdiction over
their persons.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="7">13 July 1978</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>,
basically upholding the respondents' contention and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">this </span>Court
hereby renders judgment as follows:</blockquote>

issued in Civil Case No. 18860 of the court below (Annexes B, D, E, I and M,
petition and Annexes 6-A and 9, answer), and making permanent the restraining
order heretofore issued in these proceedings."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the petition before us.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their respective briefs, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">p</span>arties posed the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">whether</span> or not there
was a valid service of summons upon the Persons of respondents Romeo Lazaro,
Jose Lazaro and Vivencio Lopez.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">whether</span> or not there
was voluntary appearance by the respondents as defendants below, through Atty.
Gerardo B. Roldan and their co-respondent Romeo Lazaro.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised may be further simplified into whether or not
jurisdiction was lawfully acquired by the court a <u>quo</u> over the persons
of the respondents Jose Lazaro, Romeo Lazaro and Vivencio Lazaro.</p>

<p class="BODY">Basically, there are two (2) ways by which a court acquires
jurisdiction over the person of the defendant or respondent:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) by service of summons upon the defendant;
and (b) by voluntary appearance of the defendant in court and his submission to
its authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to service of summons, the Revised Rules of Court
prescribe that a copy of the summons be served personally upon the defendant by
"handing him a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">COPY </span>thereof
in person or if he refuses to receive it, by tendering it<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>to him".<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Personal service, however, may be dispensed with and substituted service may be
availed of if the defendant cannot be served personally "within a
reasonable time".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, it appears that the sheriff had availed of
substituted service in seeking to serve the summons upon all the defendants by
serving a copy thereof "through Dr. Ernesto Lazaro personally".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perusal, however, of the sheriff's return<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
reveals that the sheriff failed to specify therein what prior efforts, if any,
had been exerted to serve summons upon the other defendants personally within a
reasonable period of time, and the lack of success of such efforts, before
proceeding to substituted service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
specification in the sheriff's return is essential for enforcement of the rule
under the Revised Rules of Court that substituted service may be resorted to
only where it is not possible to serve the defendant or defendants promptly in
person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As this Court ruled in <u>Keister
vs. Navarro</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>,</p>

<blockquote>"[<u>T]he impossibility of prompt
service in person should be shown by stating the efforts made to find the
defendant personally and the fact <span class="GramE">that<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>such</span> efforts failed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This statement should be made in the proof of
service</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is necessary because
substituted service is in derogation of the usual method of service - - -
."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We therefore uphold the respondent appellate court's finding
that, while Ernesto Lazaro was validly served, with respect to respondents Jose
Lazaro, Romeo Lazaro and Vivencio Lopez, there was no valid service of summons <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are,
nonetheless, unable to sustain its conclusion that the trial court never
acquired jurisdiction over the persons of the said respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier noted, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant
can also be acquired by his voluntary appearance in court and his submission to
its authority, for voluntary appearance is equivalent to service of summons.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As long <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">ago as </span>1918,
the essence of voluntary appearance was explained by this Court through <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Mr. </span>Justice
Johnson in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Flores vs. </span>Zurbito</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A voluntary appearance is a waiver of the necessity of a
formal notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>An appearance in
whatever form, without explicitly objecting to the jurisdiction of the court
over the person, is a submission to the jurisdiction of the court over the
person</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the <u>formal</u>
method of entering an appearance in a cause pending in the courts is to deliver
to the clerk a written direction order­ing him to enter the appearance of the
person who subscribes it, <u>an appearance may be made by simply filing a
formal motion, or plea or answer</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This formal method of appearance is not necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">may
appear without such formal appearance and thus submit himself to the
jurisdiction of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>He may
appear by presenting a motion, for example, and unless by such appearance he
specifically objects to the jurisdiction of the court, he thereby gives his
assent to the jurisdiction of the court over his person</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the appearance is by motion objecting to
the jurisdiction of the court over his person, it must be for the <u>sole</u>
and <u>separate</u> purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>If his motion is for any other purpose
than to object to the jurisdiction of the court over his person, he thereby
submits himself to the jurisdiction court</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case before us,
the defendants appeared before the trial court a number of times without
raising any objection to the improper service of summons:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the defendants, through Atty. Gerardo
Roldan, appeared in court and filed two successive motions for extension of
time, to file an answer to the complaint; (2) more than two years after
rendition of the judgment by default by the trial court, defendants; through
their co-defendant Romeo Lazaro, filed a motion for extension of time within
which to vacate the premises involved and to look for another place to live in,
raising no question concerning the jurisdiction of the trial court over the
persons of the defendants; and (3) the defendants, through their counsel Atty.
Roldan, moved for reconsideration of the judgment of the trial court and for
dissolution of the writ of execution, again without contesting the jurisdiction
of the court over their persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold
that by anyone or more of these acts, and certainly by the whole series of
acts, the defendants, respondents herein, effectively waived the initial lack
of jurisdiction over their persons and submitted to the authority of the trial
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The respondents assert
that only voluntary appearance <u>during trial</u> is equivalent to waiver of
service, and that therefore, the motion for extension of time within which to
vacate the premises filed by Romeo Lazaro <u>after trial</u> and after
rendition of judgment, was not equivalent to waiver of summons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We are unable to give the
above affidavits any credence or weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They appear to us as very late second thoughts, transparently devised to
conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the posture of "no voluntary
appearance" adopted by the defendants' subsequent </span>counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those affidavits were submitted too late in
the day, as it were, to avoid the effect of their voluntary appearance before
the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The affidavits
concerning lack of authority of respondent Romeo Lazaro to file the motion
pleading "for humanitarian reasons" for <span class="GramE">an
extension of time to locate an alternative residence are</span> thoroughly
unpersuasive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note, in this
connection, that all the defendants were not only immediate neighbors residing
in adjacent units of a single apartment house but also members of the same
family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto Lazaro is the father of
respondents Jose Lazaro and Romeo Lazaro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the natural tendency of Ernesto Lazaro, upon receipt of the summons
issued by the trial court must have been to inform his children living beside
him about the summons; similarly, the natural tendency of Romeo Lazaro must
have been to inform his father and brother and other relatives living in the
same apartment house about the steps taken to defer their ejectment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The affidavit of Atty. Roldan is particularly deplorable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An attorney is presumed to be authorized by
his client in a case in which he appears.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, Atty. Roldan was correctly presumed by the trial court to have been
authorized by the defendants below to appear on their behalf when he filed the
motions for extension of time to answer and what is more, when he filed the
first motion for reconsideration of the judgment of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Either Atty. Roldan's 1977 affidavit is plain
perjury or he was misleading and trifling with and imposing upon the trial
court back in 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even when an
attorney is employed by an unauthorized person to represent a client, the client
will be bound where he has knowledge of the fact that he is being represented
by an attorney in a particular litigation and takes no prompt measure to
repudiate the assumed authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
security and finality of judicial proceedings are matters of insistent public
policy and require that the evasions and tergiversations of unsuccessful
litigants and their counsel be firmly rejected and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">not </span>permitted to overcome the presumption of authority the part
of an attorney.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
