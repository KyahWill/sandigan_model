Occidental<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
by private respondent spouses against petitioner Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Company (PLDT, for brevity) for the injuries they sustained in the
evening of July 30, 1968 when their jeep ran over a mound of earth and fell
into an open trench, an excavation allegedly undertaken by PLDT for the
installation of its underground conduit system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint alleged that respondent Antonio Esteban failed to notice
the open trench which was left uncovered because of the creeping darkness and
the lack of any warning light or signs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a result of the accident, respondent Gloria Esteban allegedly sustained
injuries on her arms, legs and face, leaving a permanent scar on her cheek,
while the respondent husband suffered cut lips.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, the windshield of the jeep was shattered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">PLDT, in its answer, denies liability on the contention that the
injuries sustained by respondent spouses were the result of their own
negligence and that the entity which should be held responsible, if at all, is
L.R. <span class="SpellE">Barte</span> and Company (<span class="SpellE">Barte</span>,
for short), an independent contractor which undertook the construction of the
manhole and the conduit system.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, PLDT filed a third-party complaint against <span class="SpellE">Barte</span>
alleging that, under the terms of their agreement, PLDT should in no manner be
answerable for any accident or injuries arising from the negligence or
carelessness of <span class="SpellE">Barte</span> or any of its employees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In answer thereto, <span class="SpellE">Barte</span> claimed that it was not
aware nor was it notified of the accident involving respondent spouses and that
it had complied with the terms of its contract with PLDT by installing the
necessary and appropriate standard signs in the vicinity of the work site, with
barricades at both ends of the excavation and with red lights at night along
the excavated area to warn the traveling public of the presence of excavations.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1974</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered a decision in favor of private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> part of which reads:</p>

Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company is hereby ordered (A) to pay the

reversing the decision of the lower court and dismissing the complaint of

On <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1980</st1:date>, the

respondent court, in a resolution likewise penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Agrava</span>, allowed respondents to file a second motion for

Said resolution was received by private respondents on <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1980</st1:date> but prior thereto, private

The Court of Appeals, in view of the divergent opinions on the resolution of

<p class="BODY">Coming to this Court on a petition for review on <i>certiorari,</i>
petitioner assigns the following errors:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in not denying private
respondents’ second motion for reconsideration on the ground that the decision
of the Special Second Division, dated <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1979</st1:date>, and the resolution of the Special Ninth Division, dated <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1980</st1:date>, are already final,
and on the additional ground that said second motion for reconsideration is <u>pro</u>
<u>forma</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Respondent court erred in reversing the aforesaid decision and
resolution and in misapplying the independent contractor rule in holding PLDT
liable to respondent Esteban spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">From the foregoing chronology, we are
convinced that both the motion for leave to file a second motion for
reconsideration and, consequently, said second motion for reconsideration
itself were filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court, which had procedural
governance at the time, provided that a second motion for reconsideration may
be presented within fifteen (15) days from notice of the order or judgment
deducting the time in which the first motion has been pending.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondents having filed their first motion for reconsideration on the
last day of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of fifteen (15)
days within which to do so, they had only one (1) day from receipt of the order
denying said motion to file, with leave of court, a second motion for
reconsideration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, after their receipt on <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1980</st1:date> of the resolution denying their first
motion for reconsideration, private respondents had two remedial options.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="2">February
 23, 1980</st1:date>, the remaining one (1) day of the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, they could have filed a motion for
leave of court to file a second motion for reconsideration, conceivably with a
prayer for the extension of the period within which to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, they could have appealed through
a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> to this Court within fifteen (15)
days from <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1980</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead, they filed a motion for leave to file a second motion for
reconsideration on February 29, 1980, and said second motion for
reconsideration on March 7, 1980, both of which motions were by then
time-barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, after the expiration on <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1980</st1:date> of the original fifteen (15)
day period, the running of which was suspended during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the first motion for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals could no longer
validly take further proceedings on the merits of the case, much less to alter,
modify or reconsider its aforesaid decision and/or resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the motion for leave to file a
second motion for reconsideration by herein respondents on February 29, 1980
and the subsequent filing of the motion itself on March 7, 1980, after the
expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to file the
same, produced no legal effects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only a
motion for re-hearing or reconsideration filed in time shall stay the final
order or judgment sought to be re-examined.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The consequential result is that the resolution of respondent
court of March 11, 1980 granting private respondents’ aforesaid motion for
leave and, giving them an extension of ten (10) days to file a second motion
for reconsideration, is null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The period for filing a second motion for reconsideration had already
expired when private respondents sought leave to file the same, and respondent
court no longer had the power to entertain or grant the said motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid extension of ten (10) days for
private respondents to file their second motion for reconsideration was of no
legal consequence since it was given when there was no more period to
extend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an elementary rule that an
application for extension of time must be filed prior to the expiration of the
period sought to be extended.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Necessarily, the discretion of respondent court to grant said extension for
filing a second motion for reconsideration is conditioned upon the timeliness
of the motion seeking the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">No appeal having been taken seasonably, the respondent court's
decision, dated <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1979</st1:date>,
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The subsequent resolutions of respondent court, dated <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1980</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1980</st1:date>, allowing private
respondents to file a second motion for reconsideration and reversing the
original decision are null and void and cannot disturb the finality of the
judgment nor restore jurisdiction to respondent court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is but in line with the accepted rule
that once a decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
it is removed from the power and jurisdiction of the court which rendered it to
further alter or amend, much less revoke it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>

The court's inherent power to correct its own errors should be exercised before
the finality of the decision or order sought to be corrected, otherwise
litigation will be endless and no question could be considered finally settled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the granting or denial of a motion
for reconsideration involves the exercise of discretion,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
the same should not be exercised whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily, but
prudently in conformity with law, justice, reason and equity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the aforesaid
procedural lapses into the substantive merits of the case, we find no error in
the findings of the respondent court in its original decision that the accident
which befell private respondents was due to the lack of diligence of respondent
Antonio Esteban and was not imputable to negligent omission on the part of
petitioner PLDT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such findings were
reached after an exhaustive assessment and evaluation of the evidence on
record, as evidenced by the respondent court's resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1980</st1:date> which we quote with
approval:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>First</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

would not have hit the ACCIDENT MOUND.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Exhibit B shows, through the <span class="SpellE">tiremarks</span>,
that the ACCIDENT MOUND was hit by the jeep swerving from the left that is,
swerving from the inside lane.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
caused the swerving is not disclosed; but, as the cause of the accident,
defendant cannot be made liable for the damages suffered by plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accident was not due to the absence of
warning signs, but to the unexplained abrupt swerving of the jeep from the
inside lane.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That may explain
plaintiff-husband's insistence that he did not see the ACCIDENT MOUND for which
reason he ran into it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Second</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
plaintiff's jeep was on the inside lane before it swerved to hit the ACCIDENT
MOUND could have been corroborated by a picture showing <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
Street to the south of the ACCIDENT MOUND.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has been stated that the ditches along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> had already been
covered except the 3 or 4 meters where the ACCIDENT MOUND was located.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit B-1 shows that the ditches on <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> Street north of the ACCIDENT MOUND had already been
covered, but not in such a way as to allow the outer lane to be freely and
conveniently passable to vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
situation could have been worse to the south of the ACCIDENT MOUND for which
reason no picture of the ACCIDENT MOUND facing south was taken. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Third</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's jeep was not running at 25 kilometers an hour as
plaintiff-husband claimed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that
speed, he could have braked the vehicle the moment it struck the ACCIDENT
MOUND.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The jeep would not have climbed
the ACCIDENT MOUND several feet as indicated by the <span class="SpellE">tiremarks</span>
in Exhibit B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The jeep must have been
running quite fast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the jeep had been
braked at 25 kilometers an hour, plaintiffs would not have been thrown against
the windshield and they would not have suffered their injuries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Fourth</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
accident did not happen because the jeep was running quite fast on the inside lane
and for some reason or other it had to swerve suddenly to the right and had to
climb over the ACCIDENT MOUND, then plaintiff-husband had not exercised the
diligence of a good father of a family to avoid the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the drizzle, he should not have run on
dim lights, but should have put on his regular lights which should have made
him see the ACCIDENT MOUND in time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
he was running on the outside lane at 25 kilometers an hour, even on dim
lights, his failure to see the ACCIDENT MOUND in time to brake the car was
negligence on his part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ACCIDENT
MOUND was relatively big and visible, being 2 to 3 feet high and 1-1/2 feet
wide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he did not see the ACCIDENT
MOUND in time, he would not have seen any warning sign either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew of the existence and location of the
ACCIDENT MOUND, having seen it many previous times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With ordinary precaution, he should have
driven his jeep on the night of the accident so as to avoid hitting the
ACCIDENT MOUND."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above findings clearly show that the negligence of respondent
Antonio Esteban was not only contributory to his injuries and those of his wife
but goes to the very cause of the occurrence of the accident, as one of its
determining factors, and thereby precludes their right to recover damages.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
The perils of the road were known to, hence appreciated and assumed by, private
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By exercising reasonable
care and prudence, respondent Antonio Esteban could have avoided the injurious
consequences of his act, even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that there was some alleged negligence on the part of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presence of warning signs could not have completely prevented
the accident; the only purpose of said signs was to inform and warn the public
of the presence of excavations on the site.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The private respondents already knew of the presence of said
excavations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not the lack of
knowledge of these excavations which caused the jeep of respondents to fall
into the excavation but the unexplained sudden swerving of the jeep from the
inside lane towards the accident mound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As opined in some quarters, the omission to perform a duty, such as the
placing of warning signs on the site of the excavation, constitutes the proximate
cause only when the doing of the said omitted act would have prevented the
injury.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
It is basic that private respondents cannot charge PLDT for their injuries
where their own failure to exercise due and reasonable care was the cause
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is both a societal norm and
necessity that one should exercise a reasonable degree of caution for his own
protection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, respondent
Antonio Esteban had the last clear chance or opportunity to avoid the accident,
notwithstanding the negligence he imputes to petitioner PLDT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a resident of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, he passed on
that street almost everyday and had knowledge of the presence and location of
the excavations there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was his
negligence that exposed him and his wife to danger, hence he is solely
responsible for the consequences of his imprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, we also sustain the findings of respondent Court of
Appeals in its original decision that there was insufficient evidence to prove
any negligence on the part of PLDT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
have for consideration only the self-serving testimony of respondent Antonio
Esteban and the unverified photograph of merely a portion of the scene of the
accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of a police report
of the incident and the non-submission of a medical report from the hospital
where private respondents were allegedly treated have not even been
satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly observed by respondent court in its <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
extended resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="1">January 24,
 1980</st1:date> -</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no
third party eye-witness of the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As to how the accident occurred, the Court can only rely on the
testimonial evidence of plaintiffs themselves, and such evidence should be very
carefully evaluated, with defendant, as the party being charged, being given
the benefit of any doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Definitely
without ascribing the same motivation to plaintiffs, another person could have
deliberately engineered a similar accident in the hope and expectation that the
Court can grant him substantial moral and exemplary damages from the big
corporation that defendant is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
statement is made only to stress the disadvantageous position of defendant
which would have extreme difficulty in contesting such person's claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there were no witness or record available
from the police department of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
defendant would not be able to determine for itself which of the conflicting
testimonies of plaintiffs is correct as to the report or non-report of the
accident to the police department."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A person claiming damages for the negligence of another has the
burden of proving the existence of such fault or negligence causative
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts constitutive of
negligence must be affirmatively established by competent evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
