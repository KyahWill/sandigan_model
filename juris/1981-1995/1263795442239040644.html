<p class="BODY">The petitioner seeks the nullification by 
<i><span>certiorari</span></i> of two resolutions of respondent Court of Appeals 
in CA G.R. No. Sp. <span>08253-R:<span>&nbsp; </span></span>one dated <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="12">December <span>9, </span>1981</st1:date>, denying 
its motion <span style="font-style: italic;">inter</span> <span class="SpellE"><em>alia</em></span> to declare void the auction sale held on 
<st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="8">August 24, 
<span>1981</span></st1:date><span> </span>at the instance of respondent Tobacco 
Industries of the Philippines, Inc.; and another dated <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="1">January <span>13, </span>1982</st1:date> denying its motion 
for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
petitioner also seeks to compel respondent Court by 
<i><span>mandamus</span></i><span> </span>to enforce an earlier resolution in 
the same case dated <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="12">December 12, 
1979</st1:date>, for the return to it of the chattels sold at public 
auction.</p>
<p class="BODY">The instant petition originated from Civil Case No. <span>116617, 
</span>instituted by Investments, Inc. (hereinafter referred to simply as 
"Investments") on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="7">July 7, 
1978</st1:date> in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the private 
respondent, Tobacco Industries of the Philippines, Inc. ("TIP").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The action was for the annulment of a 
chattel mortgage executed by Investments in <span class="SpellE">TIP's</span> 
favor covering five cigarette-making machines, <span>which </span>were about to 
be sold on foreclosure by the latter.<span>&nbsp; </span>Initially a temporary 
restraining order was issued by the Court <em>ex-parte</em> enjoining the 
Sheriff from proceeding with the auction sale of the machines.<span>&nbsp; </span>But 
not long afterwards, the Trial Court promulgated an order denying Investments' 
application for a writ of injunction and dissolving the temporary restraining 
order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Unable to obtain a 
reconsideration of the order, Investments brought the matter to the Court of 
Appeals on <i><span>certiorari</span></i><span> </span>and prohibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">That Court, on <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="12">December 
21, 1978</st1:date>, directed issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction 
against the threatened auction sale upon Investments' posting a bond in the 
amount of P75<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, 
however, by resolution dated <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="5">May 15, 
1979</st1:date>, the Court dismissed Investment's petition and lifted the 
injunction.<span>&nbsp; </span>Investments filed a motion for reconsideration, at the 
hearing of which it argued for the reinstatement of the preliminary injunction 
since "the hearing on the merits of the main case below is about to be 
terminated." The Appellate Court then suggested that the injunction bond be 
increased to P650<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to cover the principal 
obligation.<span>&nbsp; </span>The suggestion having been accepted by both parties, 
Investments accordingly filed a bond in the increased amount.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
Court approved the bond on <st1:date year="1979" day="24" month="9">September 
24, 1979</st1:date> and issued a restraining order which in effect reinstated 
the injunction earlier granted.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="12">December 12, 
1979</st1:date> the Court of Appeals promulgated a Resolution declaring that 
without prejudice to the early conclusion of the case in the Trial Court, it 
deemed the proceedings before it terminated because it had already "stopped the 
sale ... of the machines ... until final judgment shall have been rendered 
<span>in </span>Civil Case No. 116617."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><span> In </span>due course, the Clerk of 
Court caused entry of judgment in CA-G.R. No. SP-08253-R, but what was 
inadvertently entered was the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of 
the previous resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="5">May 
<span>15, 1979</span></st1:date><span> dismissing </span>the petition for 
<i>certiorari</i>, and no reference whatever was made to the subsequent 
resolutions of September 24 and <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1979</st1:date>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">Trial <span>in </span>Civil Case No. 116617 having continued in 
the meantime, judgment therein was rendered on <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="12">December <span>19, 1980</span></st1:date><span>, </span>dismissing 
Investments' complaint for lack of merit, and awarding moral and exemplary 
damages to TIP.<span>&nbsp; </span>Investments appealed that decision to the Court of 
Appeals.</p>
<p class="BODY">TIP filed with the Trial Court a motion for execution pending 
appeal;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and with the Court of Appeals 
— in CA-G.R. No. <span>SP-08253-R —</span> a motion to lift the writ of 
preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Investments 
opposed both motions on the ground that the injunction issued by the Appellate 
Court against the holding of the auction sale was meant to subsist until "final 
judgment in Civil Case No. 116617," and since the decision rendered in said case 
was not yet final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, said injunction was 
still in force.<span>&nbsp; </span>What the Court of Appeals did, however was to 
declare, by Resolution dated June <span>9, </span><span>1981, </span>that it was 
no longer entertaining the pending incidents on the ground that the case before 
it (CA-<span>G.R. No. SP-08253) </span>had long been terminated.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In so declaring the Court evidently relied only on the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of its resolution of May <span>15, 
</span><span>1979 </span>erroneously entered by the Clerk of Court (dismissing 
Investment's petition for <span class="GramE"><i>certiorari</i></span> and 
prohibition) and failed to take account of the injunction it had issued 
thereafter (upon the filing of a bond in the increased amount of 
P650,000.00).<span>&nbsp; </span>TIP then caused the mortgaged chattels to be sold by 
the Sheriff at <span>a </span>public auction on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="8">August <span>24, 1981</span></st1:date><span>, </span>at which sale it 
was the successful bidder.</p>
<p class="BODY">Investments forthwith filed with respondent Court of Appeals a 
motion for contempt and for annulment of the sale.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Court's 
response was to issue on August <span>28, 1981 </span>a temporary restraining 
order stopping TIP from taking possession of the machines, and commanding their 
return to Investments if already in <span class="SpellE">TIP's</span> 
possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Subsequently, however, by 
Resolution dated December <span>9, </span><span>1981, </span>the Court denied 
Investment's plea for nullification of the sale and for <span>an 
</span>adjudication of <span class="SpellE">TIP's</span> <span>liability for 
</span>contempt.<span>&nbsp; </span>In that resolution <span>o</span>f <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="12">December <span>9, </span>1981</st1:date>, the 
Appellate Court sustained <span class="SpellE">TIP's</span> position that the 
restraining order enjoining the sale of the mortgaged chattels had lapsed upon 
the rendition of final judgment <span>in Civil </span>Case No. 116617, 
irrespective of the appeal taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The Court also declared valid the auction sale of August 24, 1981, and 
dissolved the restraining order embodied in the Resolution of August 28, 1981 
said resolution having been "intended as a temporary measure pending 
determination of the status of the main case below." Finally, the respondent 
Court dismissed the contempt charges, finding <span class="SpellE">TIP's</span> 
offer to put up a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> in lieu of returning the 
machines to be substantial compliance with said resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></st1:date></p>
<p class="BODY">Investments then presented a motion for extension of time to file 
a motion for reconsideration, pleading time pressure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which was denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Hence, the present petition.</p>
<p class="BODY">As is at once apparent, the crux of the controversy is the 
effective life of the preliminary injunction of the Appellate Court as regards 
the auction sale of Investments' cigarette-making machines, dated <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1978</st1:date> which, after having 
been lifted, was reinstated upon the filing by Investments of the increased 
injunction bond of P650.000.00 on <st1:date year="1979" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1979</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The parties do not 
dispute the fact that the injunction was to subsist "until final judgment shall 
have been rendered in Civil Case No. 116617." The point about which they differ 
is the meaning to be accorded to the term, "final judgment" in the context of 
Civil Case No. 116617.<span>&nbsp; </span>Investments theorizes that the judgment 
rendered by the Trial Court in said Civil Case No. 116617 on December 19, 1980 
was not a "final judgment" because it was an <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> judgment and had, in fact, been appealed 
seasonably.<span>&nbsp; </span>TIP, for its part, asserts that that judgment was 
<span>in </span>truth a "final judgment" as the term is used <span>in 
</span>procedural law, even if <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> and hence, 
upon its rendition, the preliminary injunction of the Appellate Court expired, 
its life having precisely been fixed to endure until such judgment shall have 
been rendered.</p>
<p class="BODY">The concept of "final" judgment, as distinguished from one which 
has "become final" (or "<span class="SpellE">executory</span>" as of right [final 
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>]), is definite and settled.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A "final" judgment or order is one that finally disposes of a case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> leaving nothing more to be done by the 
Court in respect thereto, e.g., an adjudication on the merits which, on the 
basis of the evidence presented at the trial, declares categorically what the 
rights and obligations of the parties are and which party is in the right; or a 
judgment or order that dismisses an action on the ground, for instance, of <span class="SpellE"><em>res</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>adjudicata</em></span> 
or prescription.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once rendered, the task of the Court is ended, as 
far as deciding the controversy or determining the rights and liabilities of the 
litigants is concerned.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nothing more remains to be done by the 
Court except to await the parties' next move (which among others, may consist of 
the filing of a motion for new trial or reconsideration, or the taking of an 
appeal) and ultimately, of course, to cause the execution of the judgment once 
it becomes "final" or, to use the established and more distinctive term, "final 
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</p>
<blockquote>"* * * (A)n order or judgment is deemed final when it finally 
disposes of the pending action so that nothing more can be done with it in the 
trial court.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words, a final order is that which <span style="font-size: 12pt;">gives an end to the litigation...<span>&nbsp; </span>When the 
order or judgment does not dispose of the case completely but leaves something 
to be done upon the merits, it is merely interlocutory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"A final order or judgment finally disposes of, adjudicates, or 
determines the rights, or some right or right of the parties, either on the 
entire controversy or on some definite and separate branch thereof, and 
concludes them until it is reversed or set aside...<span>&nbsp; </span>Where no issue 
is left for future consideration, except the fact of compliance or 
non-compliance with the terms of the judgment or order, such judgment or order 
is final and appealable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Conversely, an order that does not finally dispose of the case, 
and does not end the Court's task of adjudicating the parties' contentions and 
determining their rights and liabilities <span>as </span>regards each other, but 
obviously indicates that other things remain to be done by the Court, is 
"interlocutory",<em> e.g.</em>, an order denying a motion to dismiss under Rule 
16 of the Rules, or granting a motion for extension of time to file a pleading, 
or authorizing amendment thereof, or granting or denying applications for 
postponement, or production or inspection of documents or things, 
<em>etc.</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Unlike a "final" judgment or order, which is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, as above pointed out, an "interlocutory" order 
may not be questioned on appeal except only as part of an appeal that may 
eventually be taken from the final judgment rendered in the case</p>
<blockquote>"** Only final judgments or orders shall be subject to 
appeal.<span>&nbsp; </span>No interlocutory order shall stay the progress of an 
action, nor shall it be subject of appeal until final judgment is rendered for 
one party or another."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The rule is founded on considerations of orderly procedure, to 
forestall useless appeals and avoid undue inconvenience to the appealing party 
by having to assail orders as they are promulgated by the court, when all such 
orders may be contested in a single appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">Now, a "final judgment" in the sense just described becomes final 
"upon expiration of the period to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> if 
no appeal has been duly perfected"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
or, an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> having been taken, the 
judgment of the <span class="SpellE">appeallate</span> tribunal <span>in 
</span>turn becomes final and the records of the case are returned to the court 
of origin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The "final" judgment is 
then correctly categorized as a "final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> 
judgment" in respect to which, as the law explicitly provides, "execution shall 
issue as a matter of right".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It bears 
stressing that only a final judgment or order,<em> i.e.,</em> "a judgment or 
order that finally disposes of the action of proceeding"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> can become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">There is no showing that the parties and their counsel intended to 
give the term "final judgment" a special signification, a meaning other than 
that accorded to it by law and established usage.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their agreement 
must therefore be construed to mean exactly what it says, that upon rendition by 
the Trial Court on December <span>9, </span>1981 of its judgment on the 
merits,<em> i.e.,</em> its "final judgment", the life and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the preliminary injunction came to an end, 
regardless of the <span class="SpellE">appealability</span> of, or the actual 
taking of an appeal from, said judgment.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">petititioner's</span> theory of the case, founded on its concept of 
a "final judgment" is erroneous and cannot be sustained.</p>

petitioner.</p>
