				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, Branch II in Criminal Case No. 250 the
accused-appellant prays <span style="">for a </span>judgment
of acquittal <span style="">in lieu </span>of the
verdict of conviction rendered by the trial court on <st1:date month="10" day="31" year="1985">October 31, 1985</st1:date> with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds and holds <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> guilty of the

<p class="BODY">In resolving the issue of whether or not the defense of relatives
under Article II, subparagraph (2) of the Revised Penal Code can be invoked by
the accused-appellant in his favor, we are confronted with two conflicting
versions of the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution establishes the following facts:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> and
Julie <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> are brothers and residents of Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> married the
sister of Roberto Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the night
of <st1:date month="12" day="4" year="1984">December 4, 1984</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, Roberto Trinidad
and Sonny <span class="SpellE">Testado</span> were in the house of Roberto
Trinidad at Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> drinking liquor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> lost
control of himself and suspecting that his wife had an illicit relation with
another man, he <span class="SpellE">quarrelled</span> with his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He became violent and made loud outburst to
the extent of getting a scissor inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing the intention of <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, Roberto <span style="">Trinidad pacified him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead
of being appeased, <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>
<span class="SpellE">thrusted</span> (sic) the scissor he was holding to his </span>brother-in-law
Roberto Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente Trinidad and
his brothers went to the rescue of their brother Roberto Trinidad and wrestled
the scissor from <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Roberto Trinidad drove his jeep
and together with Sonny <span class="SpellE">Testado</span>, went to the Municipal
Building of Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> to seek the help of
policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way back and while
approaching their house, Roberto Trinidad and Sonny <span class="SpellE">Testado</span>
saw <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>
lying flat on the road through the head lights of the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roberto Trinidad stopped his jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without putting off the light of the jeep, he
alighted to help <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Roberto Trinidad was in the act of
extending assistance and asking what happened to <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, who was beside the road, shot him, which caused
his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long after, police
authorities arrived at the place and looked for <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> but failed to locate him." (Brief for
the Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, pp. 4-5)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense, in <span style="">its </span>counter­-statement of facts, relates as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On the early night of <st1:date month="12" day="4" year="1984">December
 4, 1984</st1:date>, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, together with Larry <span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Belleng</span> Alfaro, were working in the house of his
uncle <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span>
(T.S.N. p. 3 Oct., 1985).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just about
that time, his brother Julie <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> arrived and
informed him that they are killing his older brother (<span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>) (T.S.N. p.4, Oct. 1, 1985; T.S. N. p. 51,
Sept. 2, 1985).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surprised upon hearing
the news (T.S.N. p. 8, Oct. 1, 1985), <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> rushed from his place of work, proceeded to their
house, got a gun from the trunk owned by his late father and went directly to
the scene unmindful whether the gun was loaded or not (T.S.N. p. 7, Oct. 1,
1985).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he arrived at the place of
incident, he saw Roberto Trinidad (victim) clubbing his brother who was lying,
face downward and his shirt soaked with blood (T.S.N. p. 5, Oct. 1, 1985).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Earlier that day at about <st1:time hour="16" minute="30">4:30 p.m.</st1:time>
<span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> who is
living with his in­-laws, had a drinking spree in his in-law's house with the
brother of his wife Rita namely Roberto Trinidad (the victim), a cousin Jimmy <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>,
and an uncle of the deceased, Sonny <span class="SpellE">Testado</span> (T.S.N.
p. 17, August 20, 1986).</blockquote>

<blockquote>While they were drinking, <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> confronted his wife about her illicit relationship
with another man and irked by the accusation, his brother-in-law, Roberto
Trinidad <span style="">(victim), </span>butted in and
berated him as merely affiliated with the deceased family (T.S.N. p. 17, Aug.
20, 1986).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An exchange of words ensued
leading <span style="">to </span>an altercation
involving Roberto and his brother Vicente Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> defended himself by grasping a scissor from his
back and thrusting it against his assailant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This incident was witnessed by the victim's wife, Delia F. Trinidad, who
sought the help of the other brothers of the deceased (T.S.N. p. 25, July 25,
1985) namely <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Trinidad.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At <span style="">this juncture, </span>Julie
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, a brother of <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> saw the four <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
brothers namely, Roberto (victim), Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
&amp; <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, ganging up on his brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached and stoned the house as a
consequence of which he was chased by the two Trinidad Brothers. <span class="GramE">(T.S.N. pp. 41-­42, Aug. 19, 1985).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Julie <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> immediately proceeded to
the house of his uncle <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span>
where his brother Accused-Appellant <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> is (sic) working to secure assistance." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 118-120)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment, the accused-appellant and <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> whose name has been repeatedly misspelled in
the records pleaded not guilty to the crime of murder as charged in the
information which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about December 4, 1984, at about 8:00 o'clock at
night, at <span class="SpellE">Curapo</span>, in the municipality of Dolores,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, Philippines and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, confederating
and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill, with treachery and
evident premeditation, and while armed with a long firearm and a bolo (<span class="SpellE">unrecovered</span>), did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and shoot one Roberto Trinidad,
hitting him on the left chest and on other parts of his body, which multiple
gunshot wounds caused his death shortly thereafter." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 21)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Co-accused Julie <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> has remained at
large up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court adjudged the accused-appellant
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder while his brother <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> was acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant maintains that he is innocent of the crime
as charged invoking the justifying circumstance of defense of relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of making an assignment of errors,
the accused-appellant states that the trial court was confronted with two
conflicting versions, one asserting that Roberto Trinidad was shot while
assisting <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>
and the other stating that Roberto was shot while clubbing <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases, the appellant states that
defense of relative should be appreciated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article II, subparagraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code provides
that:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Anyone</u> <u>who</u>
<u>acts</u> <u>in</u> <u>defense</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>person</u> <u>or</u>
<u>rights</u> <u>of</u> <u>his</u> spouse, ascendants, descendants, or <u>legitimate,</u>
<u>natural</u> <u>or</u> <u>adopted</u> <u>brothers</u> or sisters, or of his
relatives by affinity in the same degrees and those by consanguinity within the
fourth civil degree, <u>provided</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>first</u> <u>and</u>
<u>second</u> <u>requisites</u> <u>prescribed</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>next</u>
<u>preceding</u> <u>circumstances</u> <u>are</u> <u>present,</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u>
<u>further</u> <u>requisite,</u> <u>in</u> <u>case</u> <u>the</u> <u>provocation</u>
<u>was</u> <u>given</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>person</u> <u>attacked,</u> <u>that</u>
<u>the</u> <u>one</u> <u>making</u> <u>defense</u> <u>had</u> <u>no</u> <u>part</u>
<u>therein</u>. (Underlining supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first and second requisites are unlawful aggression and
reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the unlawful
aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was incumbent upon
the accused-appellant to prove the existence of the three essential requisites
of the justifying circumstance of defense of relatives namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) in case the
provocation was given by the person attacked, that the one making the defense
had no part therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant claims that there was unlawful aggression
on the part of Roberto Trinidad considering that the scenario he saw after he
was summoned from his place of work by his other brother Julie was that of his
allegedly assaulted brother <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> sprawled on
the ground and bathed in his own blood with Roberto Trinidad clubbing <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
when Roberto was about to deliver the final blow to <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
that the accused-appellant claimed he shot Roberto in defense of his
brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, according to the
accused-appellant, the second requisite is also present considering that the
use of a gun at that pressing moment was reasonable and necessary to prevent or
repel the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> unlawful aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the third requisite, the
accused-appellant contends that there is no debate as to its presence since the
accused-appellant was clearly not a part of the melee in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find no merit in
the claim that the shooting of Roberto was done in defense of a relative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this justifying circumstance to prosper,
the evidence adduced must be persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although it is true that the accused-appellant took no part in the
provocation that led to the killing incident, his testimony that there was
unlawful aggression on the part of Roberto was self-serving and
uncorroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
discredited the accused-appellant's version and made the following
observations:</p>

<blockquote>"The following circumstances render the pretension or claim of
<span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>
unreliable and unworthy of belief:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">First, the position of the jeep in relation to <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>
that the jeep was driven by Roberto Trinidad and stopped near <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> <span style="">who was lying on the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Roberto </span>Trinidad had any ill
feelings towards his brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, he would not have stopped his jeep and
alighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not so hard for him to
accelerate the speed of his jeep, and run over the body of <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> who was lying flat on the <span style="">road, rather than alighting (sic) from his
jeep and club him.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Second, the headlights of the jeep remained lighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Roberto Trinidad had an intention to club or
to harm his inebriated and helpless brother-in-law lying on the road, he should
have put off the light of his jeep before alighting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">His having alighted from
his jeep without putting off the light shows his intention of extending
assistance to his brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Third, failure of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> to present himself to the authorities.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that immediately after having
shot Roberto Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>
ran away <span style="">and never presented <span class="GramE">himself</span> to the </span>authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If true that he shot Roberto Trinidad while
in the act of clubbing his brother <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, why did he not present himself to the authorities
and relate what happened?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The natural
instinct of any person who killed someone in defense of his person or relative
is to present <span class="GramE">himself</span> to the authorities and relate
what happened to him and what he did.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fourth, the immediate flee (sic) of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> and Larry <span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span>
without verifying the actual physical condition of <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Larry
<span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> testified that they proceeded to the place of the
incident to see <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>,
that when they arrived, they saw <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> lying on the road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it were true that they saw Roberto Trinidad club <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> and was in the act of clubbing when <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> shot him, why
did they immediately run away without extending any assistance to <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span>, or verifying
his actual condition?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Eduarte</span> and Larry <span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span> is strange and demerits human <span style="">experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is indicative of a guilty conscience." (At pp. 24-25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of any grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the trial judge who had the privilege of examining the demeanor of the
witnesses and who thus, ably ascertained the credibility of said witnesses
during the trial proceedings, we find no cogent reason to depart from the
well-entrenched principle that findings of fact of the trial court as to the
credibility of witnesses are entitled to our highest respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Norberto <span class="SpellE">Clores</span>
y Coral, G.R. No. 82362, April 26, 1990; People v. Rolando <span class="SpellE">Caldito</span>,

169 SCRA 545 [1989]; People v. Ramos, 167 SCRA 476 [1988].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, for lack of a clear unlawful
aggression on the part of the victim Roberto and of the reasonable necessity of
the means employed by the accused-appellant, the justifying circumstance of
defense of relative cannot be availed of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>, 89 SCRA 570 [1979];
People v. Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lingatong</span>, G.R. No. 34019, January
29, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant himself categorically stated in open court
that when he saw his brother <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> soaked with
blood, he thought that his brother was already dead at the time (TSN, October
1, 1985, p. 5) Moreover, defense witness Larry <span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span>
testified that he was with the accused-appellant when the latter was summoned
by his other brother Julie who informed the accused-appellant that their
brother <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> had been killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, September 2, 1985, p.
50).</span> In the light of these declarations, the flight of the
accused-appellant after shooting Roberto without even bothering to examine the
actual state of his sprawled brother <span class="SpellE">Fredeswindo</span> all
the more discredits the allegation that the killing was done by the
accused-appellant in defense of a relative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No better <span style="">test </span>has yet
been found to measure the value of a witness’ <span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">tesimony</span></span> than its conformity to the
knowledge and common experience of mankind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Maribung</span>, 149 SCRA 292 [1987])

<p class="BODY">As regards the presence of treachery qualifying the act of
killing to murder, <span style="">we </span>find the
records bereft of any proof that the mode of attack was consciously adopted by
the accused-appellant to insure that the killing will be nicely executed
without any risk to <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of the accused-appellant in taking a
gun with him on his way to the scene of the reported killing coupled with the
attendant circumstances that he was working at the time when one of his
brothers related the slaying of their brother and that he <span style="">knew nothing </span>about the earlier brawl
in his brother-in-law's place shows that it was more the product of an impulse
rather than a conscious and a discerning mind.<span style="">&nbsp;
