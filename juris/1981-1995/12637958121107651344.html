<p class="BODY">In 1961, the Association made it known to the peti­tioner that
respondents <span class="SpellE">Jison</span>, et al., wanted to open
negotiations for a new milling contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

allowance and coefficient or quota to a central which did not produce sugar
during the pre-war years specified under Philippine and American sugar quota le­gislations;
(e) the plantation owner or sugar cane planter can hot transfer the quota to
any other central, so long as the existing central in the district is will­ing

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Anent the indictment that

</span>Its promotion, protection and advancement therefore, <span class="GramE">redounds</span>
greatly to the general welfare.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence it
was competent for the legislature to find that the general welfare demanded
that the sugar industry should be stabilized in turn, and in the wide field of
its police power, the lawmaking body could provide that the distribution of
benefits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> be readjusted among its components

<blockquote>"Once it is conceded as it must, that the protection and
promotion of the sugar industry is a matter of public concern it follows that
the legislature may determine within reasonable bounds what is necessary for
its protection and expedient for its promotion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

of its vested rights without due pro­cess of law and without just compensation
as well as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a denial of equal protection
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span>the laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It claims that it has property rights in the
sugar production <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">al­</span>lowance or
quota appertaining to the <span class="SpellE">Silay-Saravia</span> Mill­ing
District which had become vested long before Republic Act 1825 went into
effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no vested right in sugar quotas, because they depend on future contingen­cies.</p>

<p class="BODY">And even granting that quotas can be considered as vested rights,
it is beyond dispute that they, like any property rights, are subject to the
regulation and control of the State under its police power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In recogni­tion of this power of the State,
the Supreme Court in Suarez v. Mt. <span class="SpellE">Arayat</span> Sugar Co.,
(96 Phil. 722) held that in case the central and the planter cannot agree on
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">disposition of </span>the quota, it
is within the competence of the Sugar Quota Administrator, now the Sugar Quota
Board, to reallocate the quota without compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In case the mill and the planters cannot agree, as in the case at
bar, no plausible reason can be found <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">why
the State cannot legislate and provide the sharing system that will <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">prevent </span>an impasse which is disastrous
to the sugar industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, there can be no argument, that in the absence of a
milling contract or the expiration of one, planters may transfer their quotas
for domestic sugar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to the AID SISA Mill
established by them even without the consent of Central.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the other hand, the
Association et al's conten­tion that as planters they can <span class="GramE">adhere</span>
their plantations with their corresponding quotas to the new central they <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">established in </span>the same district,
despite Central's will­ingness to give them the participation provided in Repub­lic
Act 809, is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To allow this
would be less than fair, eminently less than just.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Finally, the memorandum
agreement between the mill and the plantation owners where the former is
required to tear down its railway tracks after the expiration of the agreement
cannot be taken as a waiver of its abso­lute right to mill the planters'
sugarcane.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere has it been shown
that Central had abandoned its right and obligation to mill the sugarcane of
the planters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it has
manifested that it would abide by the terms of the agreed sharing basis, if the
Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">finds the same valid and
enforceable.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
