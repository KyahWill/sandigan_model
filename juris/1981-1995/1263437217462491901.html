				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for certiorari seeks the review of the decision of
the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 20779, affirming the decision of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in Civil Case No. 417-C for
Nullification/Cancellation of Documents, <span class="SpellE">Usufructuary</span>
Rights and Damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Rivas Paling is a legitimate
child of Mariano Rivas by a previous marriage with <span class="SpellE">Casimira</span>
<span class="SpellE">Makil</span>. Mariano Rivas thereafter married Salome <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> on October 6, 1943 (Annex "A" of the
Memorandum for the Defendant, p. 117, Records). Four parcels of land covered by
Tax Declaration Nos. 1960-C, 1883-C, 1884-C, and 1541-C were acquired during
their marriage with exclusive capital of her husband. Mariano Rivas died
intestate on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1961</st1:date>,
leaving two compulsory heirs, namely, his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
Rivas Paling, and his second wife, Salome <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
Rivas. As she had no children with Mariano Rivas, Salome Rivas executed on
October 3, 1962 a Waiver of Rights to Inherit with Reservation of Usufruct
(Exhibit "A") wherein she waived her right to inherit any of the
properties left by her husband but reserved for herself the usufruct of his
four (4) parcels of land. It expressly provided that her usufruct "shall
not be transferable and will exist only during my lifetime" (p. 49, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Rivas Paling died intestate
leaving as compulsory heirs her surviving spouse, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
Paling, and their four children: Milagros, Edmund, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> Jr. On May 16, 1983, Salome Rivas sold to
the spouses <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Iblogan</span> with a right to repurchase the land covered
by T.D. 1960-C (Records, p. 221).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1985</st1:date>,
the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> filed a complaint against
Salome Rivas and the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Iblogan</span> for
Nullification/Cancellation of the <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>
with Right to <span class="GramE">Repurchase</span> and of the Usufruct of Salome
Rivas plus damages. It was docketed as Civil Case No. 417-C in the RTC of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her Answer dated November 19, 1985, defendant Salome Rivas
alleged that she is the lawful and exclusive owner of the parcels of land and
that she never intended to waive her right to inherit from her husband, Mariano
Rivas. She denied under oath the genuineness and due execution of the
"Waiver of Rights to Inherit with Reservation of Usufruct," contending
that her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> thereon was procured through
fraud, mistake, force, misrepresentation, and undue influence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Iblogan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Iblogan</span> did
not answer the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1988</st1:date> handed down a
27-page decision for the plaintiffs, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered:</p>

<p class="2Q">"1. declaring Exhibit 'A' valid and binding as between Salome
Rivas and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Rivas Paling, their heirs, assigns
and successors-in-interest;</p>

<p class="2Q">"2. <span class="GramE">declaring</span> <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
Rivas Paling including her heirs, assigns and successors-in-interest as the
true and lawful owner of the parcels of land in controversy;</p>

<p class="2Q">"3. <span class="GramE">declaring</span> Exhibit 'B’ to be null
and void;</p>

<p class="2Q">"4. <span class="GramE">ordering</span> spouses, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Iblogan</span> to immediately vacate the premises of the land
described in Exhibit 'B'; and,</p>

<p class="2Q">"5. <span class="GramE">denying</span> the extinguishment of the
<span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> rights of Salome Rivas over the
litigated lands, which right shall only be terminated upon her death.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Without pronouncement as to costs."</span>
(Records pp. 237-238)</p>

<p class="BODY">Salome appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the trial
Court's judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition for review, Salome alleges that the Court of
Appeals erred:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. in holding that the issue of approval of document marked
Exhibit "A" was never raised in the answer to the complaint nor
litigated in the court below, <span style="font-size:12.0pt">and such failure
of petitioner-appellant to invoke it as a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">defense in answer to the
complaint constituted a waiver</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">thereof;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. in not finding that the document Exhibit "A" (Waiver
of Right to Inherit with Reservation of <span class="SpellE">Usufructuary</span>)
was null and void <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt">ab</span></u></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> for having
been executed contrary to law;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. <span class="GramE">in</span> holding that the execution of the
document marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A" was not
vitiated by fraud, force, misrepresentation and undue influence;</p>

<p class="NUM">4. <span class="GramE">in</span> finding that the properties in
question are the exclusive and capital properties of Mariano Rivas;</p>

<p class="NUM">5. in finding that petitioner-appellant never considered herself
as belonging to the cultural minorities when she executed the Deed of Sale With
Right to Repurchase, marked as Exhibit "B", because if she was truly
a member of the cultural minorities, why did she not submit for approval by the
Office of the Muslim Affairs and Cultural Minorities the said Exhibit "B."
Her failure to do so reinforced and strengthened <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
submission that petitioner-appellant does not belong to the cultural minorities
in contemplation of law; and</p>

<p class="NUM">6. <span class="GramE">in</span> holding that petitioner-appellant
was guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and prescription for her failure
to annul the document marked Exhibit "A" for more than twenty (20)
years since its execution in 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her first, second and fifth assignments of error, petitioner
would want this Court to declare the "Waiver of Rights to Inherit with
Reservation of Usufruct" (Exhibit "A"), null and void for want
of approval by competent authorities in accordance with Section 120 of
Commonwealth Act No. 141, which provides that:</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Sec. 120.</span> Conveyances and
encumbrance made by persons belonging to the so called "non-Christian
Tribes," when proper, shall be valid if the person making the conveyance
or encumbrance is able to read and can understand the language in which the
instrument of conveyance or encumbrances is written. Conveyances and
encumbrances made by illiterate non-Christians shall not be valid unless duly
approved by the Commissioner of <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>." (<span class="GramE">now</span> Office of Muslim
Affairs and Cultural Minorities). (<span class="GramE">as</span> amended by RA
3872, Sec. 3, approved on <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="6">June 18,
 1964</st1:date>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner faults the Court of Appeals in holding that the above
legal provision was never raised in the Answer to the Complaint, hence, it was
waived. On the other hand, the petitioner alleged that that defense was
included in the issue of "illegality of the document" raised in her
Answer (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> p. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it is true that petitioner raised the issue of illegality
of Exhibit "A" when she alleged in her answer:</p>

<p class="2Q">"D.) That defendant Salome <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
Rivas specifically denied under oath the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
and due execution of the document marked as Annex 'A' in the complaint,
because, aside from its <u>illegality</u>, her signature therein were (sic)
secured through fraud, misrepresentation, force and undue influence, and
defendant Salome <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Rivas does not know how to
read and write;" (Records p. 18 underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">she</span> however,
failed to prove convincingly by preponderance of evidence the truth of those
allegations. The new issue raised by her that the document was executed
contrary to the provision of Commonwealth Act No. 141, was not convincingly
proven. The trial court and the Court of Appeals were not convinced that she is
a member of a non-Christian tribe or of a cultural minority group who may not
transfer or dispose of real property without the approval of competent
authority. The certification (marked as Exhibit "1", p. 71, Records)
that "Salome <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Rivas is a member of the
national cultural minorities..." which was offered in evidence has no
probative value. It was not identified by the person who issued it, or his
representative, <span class="GramE">nor</span> by Salome Rivas. It is a mere
scrap of paper. Petitioner's argument that it is a public document, hence, it
need not be identified by the government official or authority who issued it,
is unavailing for even if it is considered a public document, it is "not
conclusive evidence with respect to the truthfulness of the statements made
therein by the interested parties" (<span class="SpellE">Dupilas</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabacuñgan</span>, 36 Phil. 254).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, after a careful consideration of all the
evidence presented - testimonial and documentary - the trial court and Court of
Appeals found that Salome <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Rivas did not
really belong to a cultural minority group within the contemplation of Sec. 120
of CA 141. That factual finding is binding on us (Co vs. Intermediate Appellate
Court, 162 SCRA 390).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court further opined that private respondents'
evidence regarding the validity, authenticity, and due execution of Exhibit
"A" are far more weighty than the evidence of the petitioner. Since
the Supreme Court decides appeals which only involve questions of law (PNB vs.
CA, 159 SCRA 433), it will not analyze and re-weigh the evidence of the parties
all over again.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the
petition for review is DENIED for lack of merit and the decision of the Court
of Appeals is AFFIRMED. <span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioner.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style:italic">Cruz, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Bellosillo</span>, <span style="font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiason</span>, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">concur</span>.</span><br>
