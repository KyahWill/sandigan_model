<p class="BODY">This is an appeal interposed by Solomon <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr., from 
the decision dated July 25, 1963 and other rulings and orders of the then Court 
of First Instance [CFI] of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch V in Civil Case No. Q-5063, entitled 
"<em>Solomon Boysaw and Alfredo M. Yulo, Jr., Plaintiffs versus Interphil 
Promotions, Inc., Lope Sarreal</em><span style="font-style: italic;">, Sr. 
</span><em>and Manuel Nieto, Jr., Defendants</em>", which, among others, ordered 
them to jointly and severally pay defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
Manuel <span>Nieto, </span><span>Jr., </span>the <span>total </span>sum of 
P25,000.00, broken down into P20,000.00 as moral damages and P5,000.00 as 
attorney's fees; the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> Promotions, Inc. and Lope <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, Sr., P250,000.00 as unrealized profits, P33,369.72 
as actual damages and P5,000.00 as attorney's fees; and defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Lope <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, Sr., the 
additional amount of P<span>20,000.00 </span>as moral damages aside from 
costs.</p>
<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">On May 1, 1961, Solomon <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> and his 
then Manager, Willie Ketchum, signed with <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> 
Promotions, Inc. represented by Lope <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, Sr., a 
contract to engage Gabriel "Flash" <span class="SpellE">Elorde</span> in a boxing 
contest for the junior lightweight championship of the world.</p>
<p class="BODY">It was stipulated that the bout would be held at the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Memorial Stadium in Manila on September 30, 1961 or 
not later than thirty [30] days thereafter should a postponement be mutually 
agreed upon, and that <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> would not, prior to the 
date of the boxing contest, engage in any other such contest without the written 
consent of <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> Promotions, Inc.</p>
<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1961, a supplemental agreement on certain details not 
covered by the principal contract was entered into by Ketchum and <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> signed Gabriel "Flash" <span class="SpellE">Elorde</span> to a similar agreement, that is, to engage <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> in a title fight at the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Memorial Stadium on September 30, 1961.</p>
<p class="BODY">On June 19, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> fought and 
defeated Louis Avila in a ten-round non-title bout held in Las Vegas, Nevada, 
U.S.A. [pp. 26-27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., session of March 14, 
1963].</p>
<p class="BODY">On July 2, 1961, Ketchum, on his own behalf and on behalf of his 
associate Frank <span class="SpellE">Ruskay</span>, assigned to J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> the managerial 
rights over Solomon <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Presumably <span>in </span>preparation for his engagement with 
<span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>, Solomon <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> 
arrived in the Philippines on July 31, 1961.</p>
<p class="BODY">On September 1, 1961, J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> assigned to Alfredo J. <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr. the managerial rights over <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> that he earlier acquired from Ketchum and <span class="SpellE">Ruskay</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The next day, September 2, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> wrote Lope <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, Sr. 
informing him of his arrival and presence in the Philippines.</p>
<p class="BODY">On September 5, 1961, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr. 
wrote to <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, informing him of his acquisition of 
the managerial rights over <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> and indicating his 
and <span class="SpellE">Boysaw's</span> readiness to comply with the boxing 
contract of May 1, 1961.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the same date, on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span> wrote a letter 
to the Games and Amusement Board [GAB] expressing concern over reports that 
there had been a switch of managers in the case of <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span>, of which he had not been formally notified, and 
requesting that <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> be called to an inquiry to 
clarify the situation.</p>
<p class="BODY">The GAB called a series of conferences of the parties concerned 
culminating in the issuance of its decision to schedule the <span class="SpellE">Elorde-Boysaw</span> fight for November 4, 1961.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
USA National Boxing Association which has supervisory control of all world title 
fights approved the date set by the GAB.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr. refused to accept the change 
in the fight date, maintaining his refusal even after <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span> on September 26, 1961, offered to advance the fight 
date to October 28, 1961 which was within the 30-day period of allowable 
postponements provided in the principal boxing contract of May 1, 1961.</p>
<p class="BODY">Early in October 1961, <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr. 
exchanged communications with one <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Besa</span>, a local boxing promoter, for a possible promotion of 
the projected <span class="SpellE">Elorde-Boysaw</span> title bout.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In one of such communications dated October 6, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> informed <span class="SpellE">Besa</span> that he was 
willing to approve the fight date of November 4, 1961 provided the same was 
promoted by <span class="SpellE">Besa</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">While an <span class="SpellE">Elorde-Boysaw</span> fight was 
eventually staged, the fight contemplated in the May 1, 1961 boxing contract 
never materialized.</p>
<p class="BODY">As a result of the foregoing occurrences, on October 12, 1961, 
<span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> and <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr. sued 
<span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, Sr. and 
Manuel Nieto, Jr. in the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> [<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch] for damages allegedly occasioned by the 
refusal of <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, aided and abetted by Nieto, Jr., then GAB Chairman, 
to honor their commitments under the boxing contract of May 1, 1961.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the first scheduled date of trial, plaintiff moved to 
disqualify Solicitor Jorge <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span> of the Solicitor 
General's Office and Atty. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Edu</span> of the GAB Legal 
Department from appearing for defendant Nieto, Jr. on the ground that the latter 
had been sued in his personal capacity and, therefore, was not entitled to be 
represented by government counsel.<span>&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied insofar 
as Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span> was concerned, but was granted as 
regards the disqualification of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Edu</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The case dragged into 1963 when sometime in the early part of said 
year, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> left the country without 
informing the court and, as alleged, his counsel.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was still 
abroad when, on May 13, 1963, he was scheduled to take the witness stand.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thus, the lower court reset the trial for June 20, 1963.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Since <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> was still abroad on the later 
date, another postponement was granted by the lower court for July 23, 1963 upon 
assurance of <span class="SpellE">Boysaw's</span> counsel that should <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> fail to appear on said date, plaintiff's case would 
be deemed submitted on the evidence thus far presented.</p>
<p class="BODY">On or about July 16, 1963, plaintiffs represented by a new 
counsel, filed an urgent motion for postponement of the July 23, 1963 trial, 
pleading anew <span class="SpellE">Boysaw's</span> inability to return to the 
country on time.<span>&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied; so was the motion for 
reconsideration filed by plaintiffs on July 22, 1963.</p>
<p class="BODY">The trial proceeded as scheduled on July 23, 1963 with plaintiff's 
case being deemed submitted after the plaintiffs declined to submit documentary 
evidence when they had no other witnesses to present.<span>&nbsp; </span>When 
defendant's counsel was about <span>to present </span>their case, plaintiffs' 
counsel after asking the court's permission, took no further part in the 
proceedings.</p>
<p class="BODY">After the lower court rendered its judgment dismissing the 
plaintiffs' complaint, the plaintiffs moved for a new trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
motion was denied, hence, this appeal taken directly to this Court by reason of 
the amount involved.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>From the errors assigned by the plaintiffs, as having been 
committed by the lower court, the following principal issues can be 
deduced:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ol><li>Whether or not there was a violation of the fight contract of May 1, 1961; 
and if there was, who was guilty of such violation.<br><br></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span><span ;="" roman="" new="" times=""></span></span></span><!--[endif]--> Whether or not there was 
legal ground for the postponement of the fight date from September 1, 1961, as 
stipulated in the May 1, 1961 boxing contract, to November 4, 1961.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>Whether or not the lower court erred in refusing a postponement of the July 
23, 1963 trial.<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the lower court erred in denying the appellant's motion for a 
new trial.<br><br></li><li><!--[if !supportLists]--> Whether or not the lower court, on the basis 
of the evidence adduced, erred in awarding the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> damages of the character <span>and amount stated 
in the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></li></ol>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the issue pertaining to the violation of the May 1, 1961 
fight contract, the evidence established that the contract was violated by 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> himself when, without the approval or 
consent of <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>, he fought Louis Avila on June 
19, 1961 in Las Vegas, Nevada.<span>&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> admitted this fact during the trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>[pp. 
26-27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., March 14, 1963].<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>While the contract imposed no penalty for such violation, 
this does not grant any of the parties the unbridled liberty to breach it with 
impunity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our law on contracts recognizes the principle that 
actionable injury inheres in every contractual breach.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Those who in the performance of their obligations are guilty of 
fraud, negligence or delay, and those who in any manner contravene the terms 
thereof, are liable for damages." [Art. 1170, Civil Code].</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span>Also:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"The power to rescind obligations is implied, in reciprocal ones, in 
case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him." 
[Par. 1, Art. 1191, Civil Code].</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>There is no doubt that the contract in question gave rise to 
reciprocal obligations.<span>&nbsp; </span>"Reciprocal obligations are those which 
arise from the same cause, and in which each party is a debtor and a creditor of 
the other, such that the obligation of one is dependent upon the obligation of 
the other.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are to be performed simultaneously, so that the 
performance of one is conditioned upon the simultaneous fulfillment of the 
other" [<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, </span><em>Civil Code of the 
Philippines</em><u>,</u> <span>Vol. IV, p. 175.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The power to rescind is given to the injured party.<span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>"<em>Where the plaintiff is the party who did not perform the 
undertaking which he was bound by the terms of the agreement to perform, he is 
not entitled to insist upon the performance of the contract by the defendant, or 
recover damages by reason of his own breach.</em><span>" [<span class="SpellE">Seva</span> vs. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Berwin</span>, 48 Phil. 
581, underscoring supplied].<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Another violation of the contract in question was the 
assignment and transfer, first to J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, and subsequently, to appellant <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr., of the managerial rights over <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> without the knowledge or consent of <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The assignments, from Ketchum to <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, and from <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> to <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, were in fact <span class="SpellE">novations</span> of 
the original contract which, to be valid, should have been consented to by <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="SpellE"><span>Novation</span></span><span> which consists 
</span>in substituting a new debtor <span>in the place of the original one, may 
be made even without </span>the knowledge or against the will of the latter, 
<em>but not without the consent of the creditor</em>." [Art. 1293, Civil Code, 
underscoring supplied].</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>That appellant <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Jr., through 
a letter, advised <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> on September 5, 1961 of 
his acquisition of the managerial rights over <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> 
cannot change the fact that such acquisition, and the prior acquisition of such 
rights by <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> were done without the consent 
</span>of <span class="SpellE"><span>Interphil</span></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>There is no showing that <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span>, upon 
receipt of <span class="SpellE">Yulo's</span> letter, acceded to the 
"substitution" by <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> of the original principal 
obligor, who is Ketchum.<span>&nbsp; </span>The logical presumption can only be that, 
with <span class="SpellE">Interphil's</span> letter to the GAB expressing concern 
over reported managerial changes and requesting for clarification on the matter, 
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were not reliably informed of the 
changes of managers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not being reliably informed, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> cannot be deemed to have consented to such 
changes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Under the law when a contract is unlawfully <span class="SpellE">novated</span> by an applicable and unilateral substitution of the 
obligor by another, the aggrieved creditor is not bound to deal with the 
substitute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span>"The consent of the creditor to the change of debtors, whether 
</span>in <span class="SpellE"><em>expromision</em></span> or <span class="SpellE"><em>delegacion</em></span> is an indispensable requirement . . 
.<span>&nbsp; </span>Substitution of one debtor for another may delay or prevent the 
fulfillment of the obligation by reason of the inability or insolvency <span>of 
the new debtor, hence, the creditor should agree to </span><span>accept 
</span><span>the substitution in order that it may be binding on 
him.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>Thus, in a contract where x is the creditor and y is the debtor, if 
y enters into a contract with z, under which he transfers to z all his rights 
under the first contract, together with the obligations <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, but such transfer is not consented to or 
approved by x, there <span>is </span>no <span class="SpellE">novation</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>X can still bring his action against 
y <span>for performance of their contract or damages in case of breach." [<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <em>Civil Code of the </em></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Philippines</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>, </span>Vol. IV, p. 
361].<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>From the evidence, it is clear that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, instead of availing themselves of the options 
given to them by law of rescission or refusal to recognize the substitute 
obligor <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, really wanted to postpone the fight date 
owing to an injury that <span class="SpellE">Elorde</span> sustained in a recent 
bout.<span>&nbsp; </span>That the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had the 
justification to renegotiate the original contract, particularly the fight date 
is undeniable from the facts <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Under the circumstances, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' desire 
to postpone the fight date could neither b</span>e <span>unlawful nor 
unreasonable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">We uphold the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' contention that 
since <span>all the rights on the matter rested with the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, and appellants' claims, if any, to the 
enforcement of the contract hung entirely upon the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> pleasure and sufferance, the GAB did not act 
arbitrarily in acceding to the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> request to 
reset the fight date to November </span>4, <span>1961.<span>&nbsp; </span>It must 
</span>be noted that appellant <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> had earlier agreed 
<span>to </span>abide by the GAB ruling.</p>
<p class="BODY">In a show of accommodation, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> offered to advance the November 4, 1961 fight to 
October 28, 1961 just to place it within the 30-day limit of allowable 
postponements stipulated in the original boxing contract.</p>
<p class="BODY">The refusal of appellants to accept a postponement without any 
other reason but the implementation of the terms of the original boxing contract 
entirely overlooks the fact that by virtue of the violations they have committed 
of the terms thereof, they have forfeited any right to its 
<span>enforcement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the validity of the fight postponement, the violations of 
the terms of the original contract by appellants vested the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> with the right to rescind and repudiate such 
contract altogether.<span>&nbsp; </span>That they sought to seek an adjustment of one 
particular covenant of the contract, is under the circumstances, within the 
<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>While the appellants concede to the <span class="SpellE">GAB's</span> authority to regulate boxing contests, including the 
setting of dates <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, [pp. 44-49, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Jan. 17, 1963], it is their contention that only 
Manuel Nieto, Jr. made the decision for postponement, thereby arrogating to 
himself the prerogatives of the whole GAB Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The records do not support appellants' contention.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> himself admitted that it 
</span>was the GAB Board that set the questioned fight date.<span>&nbsp; </span>[pp. 
32-42, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Jan. 17, 1963].<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, it 
must be stated that one of the strongest presumptions of law is that official 
duty has been regularly performed.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this case, the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, warrants the full application of said presumption that 
the decision to set the <span class="SpellE">Elorde-Boysaw</span> fight on 
November 4, 1961 was a GAB Board decision and not of<span> Manuel Nieto, Jr. 
alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Anent the lower court's refusal to postpone the July 23, 
1963 trial, suffice it to say that the same issue had been raised before Us by 
appellants </span>in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition docketed 
as G.R. No. L-21506.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dismissal by the Court of said petition 
had laid this issue to rest, and appellants cannot now hope to resurrect the 
said issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the denial of appellant's motion for a new trial, we find 
that the lower court did </span>not commit any <span>reversible 
error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The alleged newly discovered evidence, </span>upon which the 
motion for new trial was made to rest, consists merely of clearances which <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> secured from the clerk of court prior to his 
departure for abroad.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such evidence cannot alter the result of the 
case even if admitted for they can only prove that <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> did not leave the country without notice to the court 
<span>or </span>his counsel.</p>
<p class="BODY">The argument of appellants is that if the clearances were admitted 
to support the motion for a new trial, the lower court would have allowed the 
postponement of the trial, it being convinced that <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> did not leave without notice to the court <span>or 
</span>to his counsel.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Boysaw's</span> 
testimony upon his return would, then, have altered the results of the case.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find the argument without merit because it confuses the 
evidence of the clearances and the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We uphold the lower court's ruling 
that:</p>
<blockquote>"The said documents [clearances] are not evidence to offset the 
evidence adduced during the hearing of the defendants.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, 
the clearances are not even material to the issues raised.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is 
the opinion of the Court that the 'newly discovered evidence' contemplated in 
Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, is such kind <span>of </span>evidence which has 
reference to the merits of the case, of such a nature and kind, that if it were 
presented, it would alter the result of the judgment.<span>&nbsp; </span>As admitted 
by the counsel in their pleadings, such clearances might have impelled the Court 
to grant the postponement prayed <span>for by </span>them had they been 
presented on time.<span>&nbsp; </span>The question of the denial of the postponement 
sought for by counsel for plaintiffs is a moot issue ...<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
denial of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition filed by them, had 
the effect of sustaining such ruling of the court...<span>&nbsp; </span>[pp. 296-297, 
Record on Appeal].</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Boysaw</span> cannot be 
considered newly-discovered evidence for as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
rightly contend, such evidence has been in existence waiting only to be elicited 
from him by questioning.</p>
<p class="BODY">We cite with approval <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> 
contention that "the two qualities that ought to concur or dwell on each and 
every piece of evidence that is invoked as a ground for new trial in order to 
warrant the reopening ...<span>&nbsp; </span>inhered separately on two unrelated 
species of proof" which "creates a legal monstrosity that deserves no 
recognition."</p>
<p class="BODY">On the issue pertaining to the award of excessive damages, it must 
be noted that because the appellants <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> refused 
to participate in the final hearing and refused to present documentary evidence 
after they no longer had witnesses to present, they, by their own acts prevented 
themselves from objecting to or presenting proof contrary to those adduced for 
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the actual damages awarded to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the appellants contend that a conclusion or 
finding based upon the uncorroborated testimony of a lone witness cannot be 
sufficient.<span>&nbsp; </span>We hold that in civil cases, there is no rule 
requiring more than one witness or declaring that the testimony of a single 
witness will not suffice to establish facts, especially where such testimony has 
not been contradicted or rebutted.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, we find no reason to 
disturb the award of P250,000.00 as and for unrealized profits to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the award of actual damages to <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, the records 
bear sufficient evidence presented by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> of 
actual damages which were neither objected to nor rebutted by appellants, again 
because they adamantly refused to participate in the court proceedings.</p>
<p class="BODY">The award of attorney's fees in the amount of P5,000.00 in favor 
of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Manuel Nieto, Jr. and another 
P5,000.00 in favor of defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Interphil</span> Promotions, Inc. and Lope <span class="SpellE">Sarreal</span>, Sr., jointly, cannot also be regarded as excessive 
considering the extent and nature of defense counsels' services which involved 
legal work for sixteen [16] months.</p>
<p class="BODY">However, in the matter of moral damages, we are inclined to uphold 
the appellant's contention that the award is not sanctioned by law and 
well-settled authorities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Art. 2219 of the Civil Code 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>"Art. 2219.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moral damages may be recovered in the 
following analogous cases:</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>1) </span></span>A 
criminal offense resulting in physical injuries;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>2) 
</span></span><em>Quasi-delict</em> causing physical injuries;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>3) 
</span></span>Seduction, abduction, rape or other lascivious acts;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>4) 
</span></span>Adultery or <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>5) 
</span></span><!--[endif]--> Illegal or arbitrary detention or 
arrest;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>6) <span ;="" roman="" new="" times=""></span></span></span><!--[endif]--> Illegal 
search;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>7) </span></span>Libel, 
slander or any other form of defamation;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>8) 
</span></span>Malicious prosecution;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>9) </span></span>Acts 
mentioned in Art. 309.</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>10) </span></span>Acts 
and actions referred to in Arts., 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34 and 
35.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The award of moral damages in the instant case is not based on any 
of the cases enumerated in Art. 2219 of the Civil Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>The action 
herein brought by plaintiffs-appellants is based on a perceived breach committed 
by the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> of the contract of May 1, 
1961, and cannot, as such, be arbitrarily considered as a case of malicious 
prosecution.</p>
<p class="BODY">Moral damages cannot be imposed on a party litigant although such 
litigant exercises it erroneously because if the action has been erroneously 
filed, such litigant may be penalized for costs.</p>
<blockquote>"The grant of moral damages is not subject to the whims and caprices 
of judges or courts.<span>&nbsp; </span>The court's discretion in granting or 
refusing it is governed by reason and justice.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order that a 
person may be made liable to the payment of moral damages, the law requires that 
his act be wrongful.<span>&nbsp; </span>The adverse result of an action does not 
<em>per se</em> make the act wrongful and <span>subject </span>the actor to the 
payment of moral damages.<span>&nbsp; </span>The law could not have meant to impose a 
penalty on the right <span>to </span>litigate; such right is so precious that 
moral damages may not be charged on those who may exercise it 
erroneously.<span>&nbsp; </span>For these the law taxes costs.<span>&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE"><em>Barreto</em></span><em> vs. Arevalo, et. al</em>. No. L-7748, 
Aug. 27, 1956, 52 O.G., No. 13, p. 5818.]</blockquote>
