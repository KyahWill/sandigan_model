				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In December 1977, the Rural Bank of San Jose del Monte, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, as plaintiff, filed an action (Civil Case No. 79)
in the Municipal Court of San Jose del Monte, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
against Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estrellita</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Epitacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gojo</span> Cruz to collect a sum of money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Simeon <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
appeared as counsel for the defendants, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Estrellita</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1977</st1:date>,
the defendants' counsel filed in the case an "Urgent Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion for PostÂ­ponement <span class="GramE">and</span>
for Extension of Time to File Answer with Appearance." In due time, they
also filed a "Motion for the Admission of Third Party Complaint
Incorporated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the Answer" and "Answer with Third
party Complaint, Special Defenses and Counterclaim." The latter pleading
contained the following libelous and offensive allegations concerning Maria Fe
Perez, manager of the rural bank, who was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
as a third-party defendant in the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"21.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That sometime, on
or about the middle of 1975, while the third-party defendant, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span>, and the herein defendant/third-party
complainant were having one of their usual drinking sessions, the former
confided to the latter of his pressing need for money and pleaded with him to
please accommodate him by consenting to the use of his name as applicant for a
loan with the plaintiff bank to which herein third-party complainant answered
that he does not know the mechanics or procedure of obtaining a loan nor that
he is qualified to be a borrower since he has no piggery project to which
third-party defendant, <u>Antonio</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Hermogenes</u></span><u>,</u>
<u>countered</u> <u>that</u> <u>there</u> <u>is</u> <u>really</u> <u>nothing</u>
<u>to</u> <u>worry</u> <u>about</u> <u>as</u> <u>he</u> <u>will</u> <u>see</u> <u>to</u>
<u>it</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>manager,</u> <u>third-party</u> <u>defendant,</u>
<u>Maria</u> <u>Fe</u> <u>Perez,</u> <u>will</u> <u>approve</u> <u>it</u> <u>as</u>
<u>the</u> <u>forms</u> <u>they</u> <u>will</u> <u>use</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u>
<u>application</u> <u>already</u> <u>bore</u> <u>the</u> <u>signatures</u> <u>of</u>
<u>co-makers</u> <u>of</u> <u>good</u> <u>financial</u> <u>standing,</u> <u>and</u>
<u>besides,</u> <u>the</u> <u>manager</u> <u>herself</u> <u>will</u> <u>have</u>
<u>a</u> <u>share</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>proceeds</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>loan</u> <u>so</u> <u>procured</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"22.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That despite the
said third-party defendant's assurances that the herein third-party plaintiff
was only made to appear as loan applicant in these plaintiff's blank forms to
accommodate his <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">compadre</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, third-party defendant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span>, and without responsibilities whatsoever, the
latter was shocked and surprised when he received a written demand sometime in
November 1977, from the plaintiff-bank requiring him to pay </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a loan which in the first place he never
applied for nor the proceeds of which he had not received and </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">when</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <u>he</u> <u>confronted</u>
<u>herein</u> <u>third?party</u> <u>defendant,</u> <u>herein</u> <u>third-party</u>
</span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">defendant</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <u>allayed</u> <u>his</u> <u>fears</u> <u>and</u>
<u>pacified</u> <u>him,</u> <u>telling</u> <u>him</u> <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>worry</u>
<u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>said</u> <u>notice</u> <u>was</u> <u>just</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>routinary</u></span> <u>standard</u> <u>operating</u> <u>procedure</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>plaintiff</u> <u>and</u> <u>that</u> <u>he</u> <u>and</u>
<u>the</u> <u>manager</u> <u>will</u> <u>see</u> <u>to</u> <u>it</u> <u>that</u>
<u>the</u> <u>obligation</u> <u>will</u> <u>be</u> <u>settled</u>;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"23.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That, likewise,
sometimes earlier and that is in 1976, despite the fact that the herein
third-party plaintiff agreed only to accommodate his <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>,
herein third-party defendant, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span>, in
obtaining a loan in accordance with the agreement set forth in paragraph 21
hereof, herein third party defendant was shocked when he was charged in a
criminal case for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> for a loan he never applied
for nor the proceeds [of] which he never received and when he confronted herein
third-party defendant, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span>, he was
assured that he will talk with the manager about it and that eventually the
case against him will be quashed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"24.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>That</u> <u>the</u>
<u>whole</u> <u>scheme</u> <u>narrated</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>foregoing</u>
<u>paragraphs</u> <u>21</u> <u>to</u> <u>23</u> <u>hereof</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u>
<u>unlawful</u> <u>and</u> <u>anomalous</u> <u>practice</u> <u>or</u> <u>transaction</u>
<u>to</u> <u>which</u> <u>plaintiff's</u> <u>manager</u> <u>and</u> <u>technician</u>
<u>pleaded</u> <u>herein</u> <u>as</u> <u>third-party</u> <u>defendants</u> <u>are</u>
<u>engaged,</u> <u>utilizing</u> <u>and</u> <u>victimizing</u> <u>not</u> <u>a few</u>
<u>unwary</u> <u>persons</u> including herein third-party plaintiff in
violation of plaintiff's charter and Central Bank rules and regulations and
which anomalous and illegal practices may be the proper subject of an extensive
investigation by the Central Bank of the Philippines;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reacting to the libelous imputations against her, Maria Fe Perez
filed, in the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, an action for damages
against Attys. Simeon <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">SM-872).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer to Ms. Perez' damage complaint, the defendants
interposed <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">affirmative</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>defenses, which are grounds to
dismiss, among them, that the complaint states no cause of action because the
libelous pleadings are absolutely privileged communication, hence, cannot be
the basis of any criminal or civil action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They asked for a preliminary hearing of said affirmative defense, which
the court granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the preliminary hearing, the court, on <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1980</st1:date>, dismissed Ms. Perez' complaint
but it allowed the defendants (<span class="SpellE">Paredeses</span>) to present
evidence on their counterclaim against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Perez promptly appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court
(AC-G.R. CV No. 00133).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1985</st1:date>, the Appellate
Court reversed the Court of First Instance and ordered it to try the merits of
the damage suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> by the defendants attorneys.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition hinges on the issue of whether or not the offensive
Answer with Third-Party Complaint prepared and filed by the petitioners, as
counsel for the defendants-debtors in Civil Case No. 79 of the Municipal Trial
Court, was absolutely privileged communication.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the Court of Appeals that the libelous allegations
in defendant <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>' answer in Civil Case No. 79 were
fabricated was anchored on the sworn statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1) of <span class="SpellE">Casas</span> that the libelous <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">allegations were false and that he signed the pleading without being
aware of its libelous contents (pp. 146-Â­147, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 79 was an action for collection of a loan obtained
by defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>, with his co-defendants,
<span class="SpellE">Estrellita</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Epitacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gojo</span> Cruz, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>sureties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue, therefore, in said case was the
validity or veracity of <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>' obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of merely denying the
material allegations of the complaint regarding the loan, <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>,
thru his lawyers, made impertinent allegations and slanderous charges against
Ms. Perez who was not even a party in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The averments contained in the answer with third-party complaint to the
effect (1) that plaintiff had been engaged in "unlawful and anomalous
practice," utilizing and victimizing not a few unwary persons, in
violation of plaintiffs' charter and Central Bank rules and regulations which
may be the proper subject of an extensive investigation by the Central Bank
(par. 24, pp. 9-10, Petition), and (2) that in connivance and collusion with
the bank's technicians, she "misappropriated x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> for their own personal use proceeds of sales of
piggery and/or poultry products of bona fide borrowers," were clearly
unrelated to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">issue in Civil Case
No. 79 of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Casas</span> was indebted to the
plaintiff bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While latitude is given to lawyers in pleading their client's
cause, its limits should not transcend the bounds of propriety, materiality and
relevance to the issues in litigation.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the
lawyer's duty as a member of the Bar 'to abstain from all offensive personality
and to advance no fact prejudicial to the honor or reputation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>party or witness, unless required by
the justice of the cause with which he is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">charged.' <span class="GramE">" (</span><span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
Mineral Reservation Board vs. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, 31 SCRA 1.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, a "pleading should contain only the plain and
concise statements of the material facts and not the evidence by which they are
to be proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the pleader goes beyond
the requirements of the statute and alleges an irrelevant matter, which is
libelous, he loses his privilege." (<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span>, 1 SCRA 396.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Could the lower court conduct a preliminary hearing on the
affirmative defense of failure of the complaint to state a cause of
action?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Appellate Court correctly
ruled that as a defendant who moves to dismiss the complaint for failure to
state a cause of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">action is deemed to
hypothetically admit the truth of the matters alleged therein, the sufficiency
of the cause of action should be determined from the allegations on the face of
the complaint without need of presenting evidence on either side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the court would be deciding the
merits of the case upon a mere motion to dismiss before the defendant has filed
an answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"In a motion to dismiss a complaint based on lack of cause of
action, the question submitted to the court for determination is the
sufficiency of the allegations made in the complaint to constitute a cause of
action and not whether those allegations of fact are true, for said motion must
hypothetically admit the truth of the facts alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in the complaint."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"The test of the sufficiency of the facts alleged in the
complaint is whether or not, admitting the facts alleged<span class="GramE">,</span>
the court could render a valid judgment upon the same in accordance with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">prayer of the
complaint." (Garcon vs. <span class="SpellE">Redemptorist</span> Fathers, 17
SCRA 341)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If the allegations of the complaint are sufficient in form and
substance but their veracity and correctness are assailed, it is incumbent upon
the court to deny the motion to dismiss and require the defendant to answer and
go to trial to prove his defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
veracity of the assertions of the parties can be ascertained at the trial of
the case on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Galeon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Galeon</span>, 49 SCRA
516-521).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the
