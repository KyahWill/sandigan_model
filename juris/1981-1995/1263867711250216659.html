we issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the respondents from

directed by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in this case is whether or not the petitioner
could be separately charged for violation of PD No. 1829 notwithstanding the
rebellion case earlier filed against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Amin</span> sustained the
charge of violation of PD No. 1829 notwithstanding the rebellion case filed
against the petitioner on the theory that the former involves a special law
while the latter is based on the Revised Penal Code or a general law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of the above issue brings us anew to the case of <u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>v.</u> <u><span style="">Hernandez</span></u><span style=""> </span>(99 Phil. 515 [1956]) the rulings of

reiterate the long standing proscription against splitting the component
offenses of rebellion and subjecting them to separate prosecutions, a procedure
reprobated in the <u>Hernandez</u> case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court recently declared:</p>

<blockquote>"The rejection of both options shapes and determines the
primary ruling of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which is
that <u>Hernandez</u> remains binding doctrine operating to prohibit the <span class="SpellE">complexing</span> of rebellion <u>with</u> <u>any</u> <u>other</u>
<u>offense</u> <u>committed</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>occasion</u> <u>thereof</u>,

<u>commission</u> <u>or</u> <u>as</u> <u>an</u> <u><span style="">unintended</span></u><span style=""> <u>effect</u>
<u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>activity</u> <u>that</u> <u>constitutes</u> <u>rebellion</u>."
(Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This doctrine is applicable in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a person can not be charged with the complex
crime of rebellion for the greater penalty to be applied, neither can he be
charged separately for two (2) different offenses where one is a constitutive
or <span style="">component element or committed in
furtherance of rebellion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is presently charged with having violated PD No.
1829 particularly Section 1 (c) which states:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution in this </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makati</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> case alleges that </span>the petitioner

Colonel <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span> is a fugitive from justice, Sen. <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> allegedly did not do anything to have <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span> arrested or apprehended. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And because of such failure the petitioner
prevented Col. <span class="SpellE">Honasan's</span> arrest and conviction in
violation of Section <span style="">1 </span>(c) of PD
No. 1829.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rebellion charges
filed against the petitioner in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> were based on the affidavits executed by </span>three <span style="">(3) </span>employees of the <span class="SpellE">Silahis</span> International Hotel who stated that the fugitive
Col. Gregorio "Gringo" <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span> and some 100
rebel soldiers attended the mass <span style="">and
birthday party held at the residence of the </span>petitioner in the evening of
<st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1989">December 1, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information (Annex "C", p. 3)
particularly reads that <span style="">on </span>"or
about <st1:time hour="18" minute="30">6:30 p.m.</st1:time>, <st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1989">1 December, 1989</st1:date>, Col. Gregorio

Senator Juan Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> accompanied by about 100
fully armed rebel soldiers wearing white armed patches".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution thereby concluded that:</p>

<blockquote>"In such a situation Sen. <span class="SpellE">Enrile's</span>
talking with rebel leader Col. Gregorio "Gringo" <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span>

(Annex A, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 65; Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be readily seen, the factual allegations supporting the
rebellion charge constitute or include the very incident which gave rise to the
charge of the violation under Presidential Decree No. 1829.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Department of Justice resolution
(Annex A, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> p. 49) there is only one crime of
rebellion <span class="SpellE">complexed</span> with murder and multiple
frustrated murder but there could be 101 separate and independent prosecutions
for "harboring and concealing" <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span> and
100 other armed rebels under <span style="">PD No.
1829.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The splitting of component
elements is readily apparent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is now facing charges of rebellion <span style="">in </span>conspiracy with the fugitive Col.
Gringo <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, being in conspiracy with <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span>,
petitioner's alleged act of harboring or concealing was <span style="">for </span>no other purpose <span style="">but </span>in
furtherance of the crime of <span style="">rebellion
thus constituting a component thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was motivated by the single intent or resolution to commit the crime of
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in </span><u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Hernandez</u>, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">:<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

</span><u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u><span style="">intent</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>or</u> <u><span style="">motive</span></u><span style="">." </span>(p.
535)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crime of rebellion consists of many acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is described as a vast movement of men and
a complex net of intrigues and plots. (People v. <span class="SpellE">Almasan</span>
[CA] O.G. 1932).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisprudence tells us
that acts committed in furtherance of the rebellion though crimes in themselves
<span style="">are </span>deemed absorbed in the one
single crime of rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v.
Geronimo, 100 Phil. 90 [1956]; <span style="">People
v. Santos, 104 Phil. 551 [1958]; People v. Rodriguez, 107 Phil. 659 [1960];
People v. Lava, 28 SCRA 72 [1969]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this case, the act of harboring or concealing Col. <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span>
is clearly a mere component or ingredient of rebellion or an act done </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">furtherance of the rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot therefore be made the basis of a separate charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Prieto</u></span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (80 </span>Phil., 138 [1948]) is
instructive:</p>

<blockquote>"In the nature of things, the giving of aid and comfort can
only be accomplished by some kind of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its very nature partakes of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a
mental operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cramer v. <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
ante) This deed or physical activity may be, and often is, in itself a criminal
offense under another penal statute or provision, Even so, when the deed is
charged as an element of treason it becomes identified with the latter crime
and can not be the subject of a separate punishment, or used in combination
with treason to increase the penalty as article 48 <span style="">of the Revised Penal Code provides.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just as one can not be punished for possessing opium in a prosecution
for smoking the identical drug, and a robber cannot be held guilty of coercion
or trespass to a dwelling in a prosecution for robbery, because possession of
opium and force and trespass are inherent in smoking and in robbery
respectively, so may not a defendant be made liable for murder as a separate crime
or in conjunction with another offense where, as in this case, it is averred as
a constitutive ingredient of treason."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The prosecution tries to
distinguish by contending that harboring or concealing a fugitive is punishable
under a special law while the rebellion case is based on the Revised Penal
Code; hence prosecution under one law will not bar a prosecution under the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">agument</span>
is specious in rebellion cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>In the light of the <u><span style="">Hernandez</span></u><span style=""> </span>doctrine the prosecution's theory must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale remains the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All crimes, whether punishable under a
special law or general law, which are mere components or ingredients, or
committed in furtherance thereof, become absorbed in the crime of rebellion and
can not be isolated and charged as separate crimes in themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"This does not detract, however, from the rule that the
ingredients of a crime form part and parcel thereof, and hence, are absorbed by
the same and cannot be punished either separately <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
or by the application of Article 48 of the Revised Penal <span class="SpellE">Code.xxx</span>
(People v. Hernandez, supra, at p. 528)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <u><span style="">Hernandez</span></u><span style=""> </span>and other related cases mention
common crimes as absorbed in the crime of rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These common crimes refer to all acts of
violence such as murder, arson, robbery, kidnapping etc. as provided in the
Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attendant
circumstances in the instant case, however, constrain us to rule that the
theory of absorption in rebellion cases must not confine itself to common
crimes but also to offenses under special laws which are perpetrated in
furtherance of the political offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conversation and, therefore, alleged conspiring of Senator
Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> with Colonel <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span>
is too intimately tied up with his allegedly harboring and concealing <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span> for practically the same act to form two separate
crimes of rebellion and violation of PD No. 1829.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the petitioner's alleged act of harboring <span style="">or </span>concealing which was based on his
act of conspiring with <span class="SpellE">Honasan</span> was committed in
connection with or in furtherance of rebellion and must now be deemed as
absorbed by, merged in, and identified with the crime of rebellion punished in
Articles 134 and 135 of the RPC.</p>

<blockquote>"Thus, national, as well as international, laws and
jurisprudence overwhelmingly favor the proposition that common crimes,
perpetrated in furtherance of a political offense, are divested of their
character as "common" offenses, and <u>assume</u> <u>the</u> <u>political</u>
<u>complexion</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>main</u> <u>crime</u> <u>of</u> <u>which</u>
<u>they</u> <u>are</u> <u>mere</u> <u>ingredients</u>, <u>and</u> <u><span style="">consequently</span></u><span style="">, cannot be punished separately from the
principal offense, or <span class="SpellE">complexed</span> with the same, to
justify the imposition of a graver penalty." (People v. Hernandez, <u>supra</u>,
p. 541)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Elias</u> <u>Rodriguez</u>, 107 Phil.
659 [1960], the accused, after having pleaded guilty and convicted of the crime
of rebellion, faced an independent prosecution for illegal possession of
firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"An examination of the record, however, discloses that the
crime with which the accused is charged in the present case which is that of
illegal possession of firearm and ammunition is already absorbed as a necessary
element or ingredient in the crime of rebellion with which the same accused is
charged with other persons in a separate case and wherein he pleaded guilty and
was <span style="">convicted." (at page 662)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

is a friend and former associate, the motive for the act is completely
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if the act is committed
with political or social motives, that is in furtherance of rebellion, then it
should be deemed to form part of the crime of rebellion instead of being
punished separately.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the petitioner can not be tried
separately under PD 1829 in addition to his being prosecuted in the rebellion
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this ruling, there is no need
for the Court to pass upon the other issues raised by the petitioner.</p>

Recently made the subject of a similar petition for certiorari and modified by
the Supreme Court into an information for the simple crime of rebellion in G.R.

Justices <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> A. Cruz and Abraham F. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> believe that PD 1866 is unconstitutional and
should be struck down as illegal per se. Justice <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
stated <span style="">in </span>his separate dissent
that PD 1866 is a bill of attainder, vague and <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the double jeopardy clause, and an instrument of repression.</p>
