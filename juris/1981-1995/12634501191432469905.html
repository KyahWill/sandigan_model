Y LANA, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Charged with murder for the slaying of a 16 year old girl, Wilma <span class="SpellE">Cagurangan</span>, and found guilty thereof with the aggravating
circumstance of recidivism, Alejandro Perez was sentenced to death by the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, and ordered to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P12,000 and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of conviction was appealed to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's conviction was based mainly on the eyewitness account
of the killing given during the trial by Jose <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span>
whose testimony as stated in the People's brief from which We quote, is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At the trial, <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span> testified
that at about 8:00 o'clock that morning, he was at the vicinity of the creek in
barrio <span class="SpellE">Dassun</span> digging for beetle larva when he saw
the accused about to hold Wilma's waist; she pushed the accused and ran away;
the accused gave chase and overtook her, stabbing her on the back; Wilma fell
to <span style="">the ground </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">there</span>upon the <span style="">accused
straddled over her and stabbed her several times with</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a</span>
knife <span style="">locally known as</span><span style=""> "<span class="SpellE">immuco</span>"
</span>after which <span style="">he fled in </span>the
direction of <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span> (pp. 34, 35, 36, 41, 82, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., March 25, 1975).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the scene of the gruesome slaying was of lower elevation than
the place where he was hidden <span style="">among the
young "<span class="SpellE">talahib</span>" </span>grass <span style="">at a distance or about 30 meters east of the
creek, <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span> could clearly <span style="">see the </span>occurrence (pp. 36, 37, 48,
49, 50, 51, 53, 64, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., </span><st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="3"><span style="">March 25, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">; p. 6 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., </span><st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="9"><span style="">Sept. 2,
 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span> also
testified that from October 8th to the 22nd he kept the incident to himself
because he was afraid of the accused, who, being an ex-convict, might kill him
(pp. 43, 76, 77, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., </span><st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="3"><span style="">March 25, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
he could not sleep and his conscience</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">kept bothering him that
he decided to report what he had witnessed (pp. 76, 77, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
id.).''<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Significant corroboration
was given by prosecution </span><span style="">witness </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Raymundo</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> who testified having seen
appellant passed by when he was plowing a field in the vicinity of </span><span style="">the creek </span><span style="">between 8 and </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="9"><span style="">9 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the morning of the day of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">slaying of the hapless victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, ferryman Luis <span class="SpellE">Cuntapay</span> declared that
he ferried </span><span style="">appellant </span><span style="">to the <span style="">other side </span>of the river known as <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>
from </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="9"><span style="">9</span></st1:time><span style=""> to </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="11"><span style="">11 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> </span><span style="">that same </span><span style="">morning and that appellant was panting as he <span style="">approached the</span> <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, and washed <span style="">his </span>muddy feet and </span><span style="">the hem </span><span style="">of his pants.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the main, appellant's
twelve assignment of errors, except one referring to the appreciation of
recidivism <span style="">against </span>him, bear
solely on the credibility of the prosecution wit­nesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of
eye-witness <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span>, his <span style="">reporting the </span>incident to the authorities only after fifteen (15) days
thereafter, without having revealed what he saw <span style="">even to his </span>parents, is pointed to as militating against his
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant then claims that <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span> was merely a <span style="">paid wit</span>ness, after trying also to show that with how he was preoccupied
with </span><span style="">what he </span><span style="">was doing at the time, digging beetle larva,
and the distance from where he was, some 30 meters to the scene, and with
"<span class="SpellE">talahib</span>" growth along the bank of the
creek obscuring his view, said state witness could not have seen the fatal
stabbing incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Digging beetle larva as
what witness <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span> was doing did not have to glue
his eyes continuously to one point or direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It takes only a bare instant to espy the
appellant, and seeing him with a girl in a rather secluded spot would be </span>enough
<span style="">to arouse his curiosity and <span style="">keep his eyes on the </span>pair, specially
when what he saw was startling as what he narrated in horrible </span>detail in
court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The delay of <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span> <span style="">in
reporting the blood-curdling </span>incident to the authorities was
satisfactorily <span style="">explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>appellant is an ex-convict who, by
the gruesome slaying of a young girl seen with his very eyes, could not but
have instilled </span>fear<span style=""> </span>in <span style="">the witness' heart that if he reported the </span><span style="">killing, he </span><span style="">then would have to testify against appellant </span>who <span style="">might thereby kill him too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This feeling of fear could have easily crept
into this witness' heart considering that </span><span style="">what </span><span style="">appellant had </span><span style="">just served sentence and released on parole
only eight (8) months prior to </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">incident, is </span><span style="">for homicide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to appellant's claim that <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span>
is <span style="">a paid witness, </span>he admitted
he had <span style="">no </span>personal knowledge of
the <span style="">alleged fact, </span>his testimony
being that he was only so informed <span style="">by
his in</span>mate in the provincial jail one Rudy Pimentel, supposedly a cousin
of <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently,
appellant was merely indulging <span style="">in a
conjecture which did not call for any proof to the contrary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the trial court conducted an ocular inspection of
the scene of the stabbing and vicinity thereof in the presence of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose was to test the
truth of the assertion of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result of the ocular inspection must have
so convinced the court that <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span> could see, as
he so testified, the gruesome incident from where he was digging beetle larva,
contrary to appellant's claim that from the witness' distance, and with some
obstruction along the line of vision, to the crime scene, said witness was
lying in giving a supposedly eye-witness account of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the language of the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"From the records, it can be seen that the Court had conducted
a thorough and searching questions on the witness Jose <span class="SpellE">Cafugauan</span>
about the incident and his motives in testifying against the accused in order
to elicit the truth and test his credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court is convinced that the witness is credible and truthful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His demeanor while on the witness stand
bespeaks of his veracity and demonstrates his sincerity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no plausible reason why the Court
may distrust his testimony and doubt his sincerity."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same thing may be said of state witness <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> whose testimony, the ocular inspection
aided to earn credence for, and belief in, said testimony, against the attempt
of appellant to discredit it with the testimony of Emilio <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>
that the latter was the tenant of the land <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>
alleged to be plowing when appellant passed by.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, this is what the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In so far as <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>, another witness for the prosecution, who
testified against the accused, the Court noted that he was not impelled by any
improper motive to testify but to tell the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court gives faith and credence to his
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony in court was
supported by the demonstration he made during the ocular inspection <span style="">and has precluded any doubt as to his
truthfulness."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From Emilio <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> came the admission that he would not know whether <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> worked on the land of which he claimed to be the
tenant of his sister, Regina <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>, on the day in
question because he left the same at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="19"><span style="">7:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the morning of that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the testimony of Juanita Perez, appellant's mother, that <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> was only being called by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Callueng's</span> brother, it could also be deduced that <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> could be working on the land as a hired laborer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His presence on the land where appellant
passed by, as <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> testified to, is therefore a
fact that could not <span style="">be </span>entirely
ruled out.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no showing that
the trial court in convicting appellant, gave any reliance on the statement of <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE">Balisi</span>, mother of the
deceased, that appellant courted the victim but was spurned in his
courtship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, there­fore, no
basis for charging the trial court with error in giving credence to said
statement, as appellant does in his 4th assignment of error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant insists on his alibi, and imputes another error to the
trial court when it rejected it as one that has taken place after he had
already committed the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it
appears that he had gone to the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> Provincial
Hospital for treatment on his lung on the day of the commission of the crime,
the records of the hospital do not show the time when he was there, as to rule
out the possibilit<span style="">y</span> that he was
at the scene of the crime at the time the stabbing incident took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against his having been positively identified
by a wholly truthful eye-witness of the actual commission of the crime,
strengthened by corroborative testimony of equally unbiased and disinterested
witnesses with no motive shown except to adhere to the truth, appellant's alibi
is unavailing.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again appellant's claim of feeling sick with chest pains that
morning of the incident which prompted him to go to the hospital cannot be
believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On his own admission, a jeep
ride from his residence in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dassun</span> direct to <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span> was available.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That<span style=""> </span>he chose to walk 2 to
3 kilometers to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>, from where he took <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">banca</span> ride
to <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span> where he took another conveyance for <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span> where the hospital was, belies his claim of
being sick and, therefore, he could not have been the author of the crime
charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I</span>t is significant
to note that the Chief of Police in his ocular inspection of the crime scene,
saw footprints proceeding northward on the sandy soil about 30 meters from the
spot where the deceased was supposedly washing clothes alone in the creek.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This fact dovetails with the testimony of the boatman, <span class="SpellE">Cuntapay</span>,
that appellant washed his muddy feet and the hem of his pants when he
approached the <span class="SpellE">banca</span> tired and panting.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the same witness who testified that he did not notice any
bloodstain on appellant's shirt or pants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant seizes upon this testimony to show <span style="">that </span>he could <span style="">not have </span>been
the culprit, for if he was, bloodstains should have been seen on his clothes,
considering the manner the killer was alleged to have attacked the victim as
described by the supposed eye-witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, there is no evidence positively establishing
the fact that appellant's shirt and pants were without any bloodstains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Cuntapay</span> <span style="">is in the
nature of a negative evidence which is not conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cuntapay</span> admitted <span style="">his </span>inability to distinguish
bloodstains where, as shown by the records, appellant's shirt was "flaming
red" and his pants were "blackish" in color as to render
bloodstains thereon hardly noticeable as such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the foregoing
discussion all bearing on the issue of credibility of witnesses, the only
remaining <span style="">question is </span>one of law
- whether recidivism may be appreciated as an aggravating circumstance, same
not having been alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant does not dispute the fact that he had in 1971 been convicted </span><span style="">by final judgment, for the </span><span style="">crime of homicide as proven by the evidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is quite settle</span><span style="">d</span><span style="">
that an aggravating circumstance proven by the evidence, although not alleged
in the information, may be taken into account as such aggravating circumstance,
the latest case on this matter, being People vs. <span class="SpellE">Entes</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The crime committed is
murder qualified by </span><span style="">treachery, </span><span style="">abuse of superior strength being already
absorbed thereby aggravated by recidivism with no mitigating circumstance to
offset it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the judgment, appealed from imposing the
death penalty has to <span style="">be, as it is </span></span><span style="">hereby </span><span style="">affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, with cost <u>de</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
