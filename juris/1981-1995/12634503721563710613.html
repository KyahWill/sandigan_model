				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Order or the
Court of Industrial Relations, dated December 2, 1972, dismissing petitioners'
complaint for unfair labor practice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Records of the case show that petitioner United States Employees
Association Employees Association (hereinafter referred to as USEAEA) is a
legitimate labor organization composed of the employees (individ­ual
petitioners named herein) of the respondent United States Employees
Association, or USEA, formerly the U.S. Embassy Commissary Association, located
at Sea­front Compound, Roxas Boulevard, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Francis G. Ready, Eugene Adams, Patrick Herlihy, George Warren and
Antonio Fernandez are officers of the said re­spondent association.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears on record that
on June 15, 1972, the petitioners, then complainants, filed with the Court of
Industrial Relations an unfair labor practice complaint against private
respondents for terminating petitioners from their employment because of
"union activities among which was the persistent demand of petitioner
union that the respondent association (USEA) bargain collectively with the
former (USEAEA) and which culminated in the strike of November 18, 1971"
[p. 9, rec.].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as
Case No. 5798-ULP and was assigned to Judge Ansberto Paredes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 29, 1972, private
respondent filed a motion to dismiss the aforesaid complaint alleging, among
others, that the CIR has no jurisdiction because (a) said respondent
association is immune from suits, it being an agency or instrumentality of the
United States government; and (b) said association is not established for
profit, therefore, outside the scope of the Industrial Peace Act [p. 55, rec.].<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 9, 1972
herein petitioners filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss filed by
private respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting on private
respondents' motion to dismiss, respondent CIR issued an order dated December
2, 1972 dismissing the complaint for unfair labor practice and made findings
that albeit the respondent USEA is not an agency of the U.S. government and
therefore not immune from suit, it is nonetheless, </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">established for profit and therefore outside
the scope of R.A. 875.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner union (USEAEA)
filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the respondent CIR <u>en</u>
</span><u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">in
a resolution dated April 7, 1973 [p. 172, rec.].<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners appealed from
the Order of respondent CIR, with the following assignment of errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court erred in dismissing
the case for lack of juris­diction, on the ground that respondent Association
(USEA) is not established for profit and therefore outside the scope of R.A.
875, considering that <span style="">the issue of
whether said association is established for profit or not has already been
decided in a previous case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
respondent Court erred in holding that the re­spondent Association is not es­tablished
for profit considering <span style="">that its
constitution </span>and by-laws allows it to operate for profit, hence,
contrary to the evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court erred in considering
respondent Association outside the scope of R.A. 875, even assuming that it is
not established for profit, because its purpose of providing comfort <span style="">and </span>benefits to its mem­bers and their
guests cannot be equated to the benevolent and lofty purpose as in the case of
Boy Scouts of the Philippines, the Philippine National Red Cross, and
hospitals, hence contrary to established jurisprudence" [pp. 13-­14,
rec.].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be deduced from the assignment of errors raised by herein
petitioners, the only issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the
private respondent United States Employees Associa­tion (USEA) is established
for profit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts show that the respondent United States
Employees Association (USEA) is a facility created pursuant to the U.S. Foreign
Service Act of 1946, as amended, pertinent portions of which read:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1139.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Commissary and mess services and recreation facili­ties abroad; charges;
transportation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Secretary may, under such regulations
as he may prescribe, establish and maintain emergency commissary or mess services
in such places abroad where, in his judgment, such services are necessary
temporarily to insure the effec­tive and efficient performance of the duties
and responsibilities of the service, such services to be available to the
officers and employees of all Government agencies located in any such places
abroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reimbursement incident to the
maintenance and operation of commissary or mess service shall be at not less
than cost as determined by the Secre­tary and shall be used as working
funds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, that an amount equal to
the amount expended for such services shall be covered into the Treasury as
Miscellaneous receipts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Secretary, under such regulations as he
may prescribe, may authorize and assist in the establishment, maintenance, and
operation, by officers and employees of the Service, of <u>non-Government-operated
commissary and mess service and recreation facilities</u> at posts abroad, in­cluding
the furnishing of space, utilities, and properties owned or lease by the United
States for use by its diplomatic and consular missions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provi­sions of the Foreign Service
Buildings Act 1926, as amended, may be utilized by the Secretary in providing
such assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissary or mess
services and recreation facilities established pursuant to this subsection
shall be made available, insofar as practicable, to offices and employees of
other Government agencies and their dependents who are Stationed abroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such services or facilities shall not be
established in localities where another United States agency operates similar
services or facilities unless the Secretary determined <span style="">that </span>such addi­tional services or facilities are necessary"
[pp. 131-132, rec., underscoring supplied].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As can be gleaned from
the aforequoted provi­sions of the U.S. Foreign Service Act, it does appear
clear that respondent United States Employees Association is a
non-government-operated facility created pursuant to paragraph (b) of said
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the association, as
declared in its constitution, is to "provide for its members and their
dependents recreational activities and a source of food and other items at
minimum prices that are consistent with good service and efficient
management" [p. 164, rec.].<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A perusal of the
constitution of private re­spondent association shows the following pertinent
provisions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All present members of the United States Embassy Commissary
Association and the Seafront Recreation Association retain their membership in
the association when this constitution is adopted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Any American who is allowed to import goods duty-free because
of his connection with a civilian agency of the United States in the Manila
area may be admitted to membership.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A new member must contribute to the Association as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The head of the family must con­tribute
to the association three percent of his annual base salary; a single person
must contribute one and one half percent of his base salary with a minimum of
$75.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contribution, less the
prescribed dues, will be refunded when the member ends his membership or when
the asso­ciation is dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At such
times, any debts to the association will be deducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the life of each membership, the
association has the right to collect from this contribution any debts to the
association.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A member and his dependents may enjoy the facilities of the
Association, and participate in its activities, and buy for cash in reasonable
quantities foods and other items, provided such member is an employee of the
U.S. Government and is entitled to duty-free entry privileges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such purchases shall be only for the needs of
the member and his family.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Other facilities operated by the Association shall be available
only to members of the Association, their depend­ents, and guests, provided how­ever
that those local employees who are members of the Seafront Recreation
Association at the time this constitution is adopted may continue to
participate in those activities in which they are now participating, at current
rates of dues of the Recreation Association.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Board of Directors will carry on all of the asso­ciation's
business; however, its action will be subject to the review of the ambassador.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It will watch the Associa­tion's operation closely to in­sure
that the Board's policies are carried out -- whether they concern finances,
member rela­tions, working conditions, pri­cing practices, food storage or any
other details of operation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>It will fix wages and in­sure that fair labor practices
are carried out in the Associa­tion, in accordance with the laws of the
Philippines</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Profits of the Association will be kept at a minimum, con­sistent
with efficient operation</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>AT the end of each fiscal period, 10 percent of the net
earnings will be put into a Reserve Fund if this fund is below $50,000 in value</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This fund will be used at the dis­cretion
of the Board of Direc­tors for capital improvements and to absorb operating
defi­cits or any kind of loss</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
remainder of the net earnings will be used to reduce prices</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Membership contributions will be returned to the members
after individual deductions of any debts to the association</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The association's assets and liabilities will be
liquidated in the most practicable manner and consistent with Philippine law</u>"<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin: 1pt 0in;">[pp. 164-170, rec.; underlining supplied].</p>

<p class="BODY">A further perusal of the constitution of the respondent
association shows that apart from the regular dues collected from the members,
the association also derived revenues from the commis­sary, gas station, snack
bars, swimming pool and other activities operated by the association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In carrying out its affairs, the respondent
association employed the petitioners as waiters, bartenders, bus­boys,
janitors, janitresses, dietitians, cooks, stock custodians, warehousemen,
typists, clerks, storeclerks, stock clerks and utility men [p. 147, rec.].</p>

<p class="BODY">The ratiocination advanced by respondent asso­ciation in support
of its stand dwells on the assertion that respondent USEA is a non-profit
organization and, therefore, beyond the ambit of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A.
875, as amended) and the jurisdiction of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, private respondent USEA asserts
that its non-profit character is discernible from the fact that there is no
distribution of earnings or profits by way of dividends or <span style="">otherwise </span>and the members do not
receive any interest in the net funds and assets result­ing from liquidation.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE find the foregoing contention of private re­spondent USEA
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">A close examination of the constitution of re­spondent
association will show that while it is true that the members of the association
do not receive dividends in the form of cash, nevertheless, they do receive
benefits in the form of commissary privileges, such as the importation of goods
duty-free, purchase of food and other items at minimum or reduced prices; and
return or refund of the capital at the end of membership or upon dissolution of
the association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same constitution
likewise provides that profits of the association will be kept at a minimum and
at the end of each fiscal period, 10 per cent of the net earnings will be put
into a Reserve Fund if this fund is below $50,000 in value, to be used at the
discretion of the Board of Directors for capital improvements and to absorb
operating deficits or any kind of loss.</p>

<p class="BODY">What then is the meaning of "profit"?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following authorities
concerning the meaning of the word "profit" are relevant:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the net return to the capital of stock employed, after deducting all the

<blockquote>"In a wider sense, profit means any advantage, any acces­sion
of goods from labour or exertion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Profit' it is said, is broad enough to cover any sort of advance, or
gain and benefits of any kind (Simcoke vs. Sayre, 148 Iowa 132, 126 NW 816,

<blockquote><span style="">"The term 'profit,' as
</span>applied to a corporation, has a larger meaning than 'dividends,' and
