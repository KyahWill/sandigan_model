<p class="BODY">Socorro <span class="SpellE">Ke</span>. <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> passed the 1954 bar examinations.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Before he could participate in the scheduled oath taking of successful 
bar examinees, an administrative complaint for immorality was filed against him 
by <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> stated that she and <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> were married on <st1:date year="1944" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1944</st1:date> and that when she married him, he represented 
himself to be single.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1948, <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> learned that her husband had been previously married 
on <st1:date year="1936" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1936</st1:date> to <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> by whom he had a 
child called <span class="SpellE"><span>Monserrat</span></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> filed a case for annulment of her 
marriage to <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> on </span><st1:date year="1949" day="5" month="10"><span>October 5, 1949</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A decision was rendered on </span><st1:date year="1950" day="13" month="2"><span>February 13, 1950</span></st1:date><span> annulling the marriage 
and ordering <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> to give P40.00 a month for the 
support of his three minor children with <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In 1951, Socorro <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> filed a civil 
case to declare his first wife, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> as presumptively dead.<span>&nbsp; </span>In a <st1:date year="1951" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1951</st1:date> decision, the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> stated that <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> were <span class="GramE">married</span> on <st1:date year="1936" day="23" month="3">March 23, 
1936</st1:date> in the Roman Catholic 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>church</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Capul</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The couple had a daughter, 
<span class="SpellE">Monserrat</span> <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, who lived 
with the petitioner from birth up to the date of the decision.<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
appears that, while the <span class="GramE">couple were</span> living in 
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span>, eloped with a 
certain Ramon Esteban and left the conjugal home without the petitioner's 
knowledge.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of allegedly 
determined searches by the petitioner in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>, and 
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> could not be located or her whereabouts 
ascertained.<span>&nbsp; </span>The court therefore ruled "that the petition to 
declare <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> 
presumptively dead for all intents and purposes of law has satisfactorily been 
established".</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> had three children 
with his second wife, <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Sometime after the judicial declaration that his first wife was 
presumptively dead, <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> married his third wife, 
Socorro Santos by whom he has five children.<span>&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> married a third time, his first wife showed up and 
filed a bigamy case against him with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to the immorality complaint 
filed by <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>, the second wife, this bigamy 
<span>case was later dismissed as a result of alleged monetary concessions which 
<span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> made in favor of <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, the latest information 
about <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> is 
that she is quite well off, having inherited properties from her parents and 
that she teaches Spanish at the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>University</span></st1:placetype><span> 
of </span><st1:placename><span>Eastern 
Philippines</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span> in <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span>Samar</span></span></st1:place><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the basis of the administrative complaint filed against 
<span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, this Court suspended his oath taking and 
directed him to file an answer to the complaint.<span>&nbsp; </span>In his Answer, 
<span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> alleged that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
</span>[W]hen he married complainant, he honestly believed that his first wife, 
<span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span>, was 
already dead; that complainant <span>in fact knew that respondent was previously 
married because respondent's child with <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> lived with respondent and complainant after 
the latter's marriage and until its annulment; that respondent has paid all the 
monthly pensions to complainant's three minor children; that respondent later 
discovered that complainant's motive in suing for annulment of her marriage to 
respondent was to get a share of the properties acquired by respondent, and as a 
matter of fact, complainant has squandered and sold the properties adjudicated 
to her in Civil Case No. 470, and the money realized from the sales was not used 
for the benefit of their children; that the value of the properties adjudicated 
to the complainant in the case for liquidation of conjugal properties was 
approximately P37,000.00; that respondent married Socorro Santos and still lives 
with her in view of the decision in Civil Case No. 501, dated November 24, 1951, 
declaring respondent's first wife, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> presumptively dead; that respondent's admission in 
Civil Case No. 399 for annulment of complainant's marriage, that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> was alive and 
residing in Manila was made in good faith, he having then received information 
from his brother, Fr. <span class="SpellE">Emerardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> was in Manila; that subsequent search and inquiries, 
however, led the respondent to believe that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> was not alive and this resulted in the filing 
by respondent of the petition in </span><span>civil </span><span>Case No. 501, 
praying that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> be declared presumptively dead; that Criminal Case 
No. 1863, against the respondent for bigamy, was dismissed by the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> upon motion of the City Attorney of 
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>; that the mere filing of civil cases against 
respondent does not necessarily reflect immorality on his part, not to mention 
the circumstances that said cases were settled or otherwise dismissed; that 
complainant's charges were motivated by hatred and revenge, intended as a ruse 
to compel respondent to give to complainant another ten hectares of first class 
agricultural land located in <span class="SpellE">Monteverde</span>, <span class="SpellE">Calinan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, plus 
complainant's desire to put respondent down 
politically."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The then Supreme Court Clerk of Court, Jose S. de la Cruz, 
was ordered to investigate the administrative charge and to submit his 
report.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date year="1955" day="31" month="8"><span>August 31, 1955</span></st1:date><span>, de la Cruz submitted 
his Report, the salient portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"It is noteworthy that the complainant had chosen not to testify in 
the investigation, and that by merely presenting documentary evidence consisting 
of copies of the complaint for annulment of marriage in Civil Case No. 399; the 
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in 
said case annulling the marriage between complainant and respondent; the 
decision in Special Case No. 501 wherein the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> declared respondent's first wife, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span>, presumptively 
dead; the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in Criminal Case No. 1863 against respondent for 
bigamy, dismissing said case, the complainant is basing her charges of 
immorality against respondent upon the latter's bad faith arising from the fact 
that, while in the annulment proceedings respondent and his attorney admitted 
that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> was 
alive, in Special Case No. 501 filed in 1951 by respondent, the latter claimed 
that said <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> 
could not be located and was unheard from for several years, and from the fact 
that he married for the third time Socorro Santos while respondent's first wife 
was alive, and who, as a matter of fact, filed a case for bigamy against 
respondent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Upon the other hand, the respondent testified during the 
investigation and declared that he acted in good faith, first, in marrying 
complainant; secondly, in instituting Special Case No. 501; and, thirdly, in 
marrying Socorro Santos.<span>&nbsp; </span>He explained that when he married 
complainant in 1944, he honestly believed that his first wife, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span>, was already 
dead; that he had to admit in the annulment proceedings, Civil Case No. 399, 
that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> was alive because of a letter he 
received from his brother, Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>; that he filed 
the subsequent Special Case No. 501 after suspecting that complainant's purpose 
in annulling her marriage to respondent was merely to obtain her share in the 
conjugal properties, and in order also to establish definitely his civil status; 
and that he married his third wife, Socorro Santos, after the decision in 
Special Case No. 501, declaring his first wife <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> presumptively dead, had become final.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"While the complainant's charges are based upon inferences or 
assumptions, the testimony of respondent is <span class="SpellE">unrefuted</span> 
that he acted in good faith.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the fact that no 
annulment proceeding was instituted by complainant until after three children 
were born to her marriage with respondent, at least shows that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span> was not 
generally known to be alive.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the second place, the admission by 
respondent <span>and his counsel in the annulment proceeding that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> was alive, is explained by respondent's receipt of 
</span>a letter from his brother, Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, to the 
effect that she might still be living, which at any rate was the very fact 
alleged in the complaint for annulment.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the third place, 
<span>respondent was constrained to file Special Case No. 501 because he 
</span>subsequently realized that complainant annulled her marriage to 
respondent mainly to get her share of their conjugal properties, and because he 
also wanted to definitely settle his own civil status after failing to locate 
the whereabouts of his first wife, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Orticio</span>; and the respondent undoubtedly had the right to 
look for <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> after his marriage to complainant 
was judicially set aside on the <span>ground that <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> was alive.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is very significant 
that no opposition whatsoever was interposed in Special Case No. 501 either by 
complainant or by <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span>insp</span><span>ite</span></span><span> of due publication 
of the proceedings; and the final decision therein can be said to have legally 
paved the way for respondent's third marriage to Socorro Santos.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>As a matter of fact, in the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> dismissing the bigamy case against respondent, it was 
in effect held that respondent married Socorro Santos without fraudulent intent, 
and said order had </span><span>become 
</span><span>final.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Complainant's allegation that respondent has failed to comply with 
his obligation to pay the monthly support of his three children with complainant 
as ordered in the d<span>e</span>cision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in Civil Case No. 399, is neither touched nor pressed 
in complainant's memorandum.<span>&nbsp; </span>At any rate, complainant may avail 
herself of any appropriate civil remedy for the collection or enforcement (or 
even increase) of said support; and respondent has presented evidence to show 
that he had complied with his obligation at least to the date of this 
investigation in March, 1955.<span>&nbsp; </span>The claim that respondent is immoral 
because of the filing against him of several civil cases, deserves no serious 
consideration since, according to respondent's evidence, said cases, aside from 
having been dismissed or otherwise settled, do not necessarily imply moral 
perversity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is recommended that respondent Socorro <span class="SpellE">Ke</span>. <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> be allowed to take the 
lawyer's oath."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The favorable recommendation, notwithstanding, this Court, 
on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="7" month="9"><span>September 7, 
1955</span></st1:date><span> issued a resolution disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> from taking the lawyer's oath, to 
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Acting upon the complaint for immorality filed by 
<span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> <span class="SpellE">Casas</span> against Socorro 
<span class="SpellE">Ke</span>.</span> <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>, 1954 
successful bar candidate; the answer filed by the latter; the evidence taken 
during the investigation; the report of the investigator; as well as all the 
circumstances surrounding the case, the Court RESOLVED to disqualify respondent 
Socorro <span class="SpellE">Ke</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Ladrera</span></span><span class="GramE"> from taking the lawyer's 
oath."</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>A motion for reconsideration of the above-quoted resolution 
was denied in another resolution issued on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="11" month="10"><span>October 11, 1955</span></st1:date><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Up to now or more than thirty-one years after he passed the 
bar <span class="GramE">examinations, <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> has</span> 
not been allowed to take the lawyer's oath.<span>&nbsp; </span>All his motions to 
allow him to take the oath filed every year without fail beginning on 
</span><st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="5"><span>May 23,

denied.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before us, now is <span class="SpellE">Ladrera's</span> 
</span><st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="4"><span>April 15, 
1985</span></st1:date><span> urgent motion, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"NOW COMES your petitioner, by and for himself and unto this 
Honorable Supreme Tribunal most respectfully stated:</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That your petitioner has been deprived from taking his Lawyer's 
Oath as member of the Philippine Bar since January 20, 1955, because of a 
petition of <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Casas</span> 
who has long ago withdrawn her complaint and has in fact attested to the good 
reputation and character of the herein respondent;</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That considering the time that has elapsed which is already more 
than thirty (30) years is more than sufficient punishment, your respondent now 
prays this Honorable Tribunal to grant him the privilege to take the Lawyer's 
Oath together with the new successful candidates scheduled to take their oath on 
April 25, 1985 at the Philippine Convention Center, Manila."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="10"><span>October 4, 1986</span></st1:date><span>, he wrote another 
letter, this time to the Court Administrator asking for the approval of his 
petition of nearly 32 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>An applicant for admission to the bar must be of good moral 
character.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Rule 138, Sec. 2).<span>&nbsp; </span>What constitutes good 
moral character within the meaning of the rule has been elucidated in precedent 
cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In </span><em>Carmen E. Bacarro v. Ruben M. Pinatacan</em> 
<span>(127 SCRA 218), this Court cited various precedent cases and 
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"One of the indispensable requisites for admission to the Philippine 
Bar is that the applicant must be of good moral character.<span>&nbsp; </span>This 
requirement aims to maintain and uphold the high moral standards and the dignity 
of the legal profession, and one of the ways <span>of achieving this end is to 
admit to the practice of this noble profession only those persons who are known 
to be honest and to possess good moral character.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Martin, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> G., 'Legal &amp; Judicial Ethics,' 5th ed., p. 15, 
citing In Re <span class="SpellE">Parazo</span>, 82 Phil. 230) As a man of law, (a 
lawyer) is necessarily a leader of the community, looked up to as a model 
citizen.' (<span class="SpellE"><em>Planza</em></span><em> v. Arcangel,</em> 21 
SCRA 1, 4).<span>&nbsp; </span>He sets an example to his fellow citizens not only for 
his respect for the law, but also for his clean living.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Martin, 
<em>supra</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>, p. 36) 
<span class="GramE">Thus, becoming a lawyer is more than just going through a law 
course and passing the Bar examinations.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>One who has the 
lofty aspiration of becoming </span>a <span>member of the Philippine Bar must 
satisfy this Court, which has the power, jurisdiction and duty to pass upon the 
qualifications, ability and moral character of candidates for admission to the 
Bar, that he has measured up to that rigid and ideal standard of moral fitness 
required by his chosen </span><span>vocation."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Court, in the past, consistently denied the annual 
petitions of <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> that he <span class="GramE">be</span> allowed to take the lawyer's oath.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
claimed that when he married his </span>second wife, he sincerely believed that 
his first wife was already dead.<span>&nbsp; </span>He married his third wife only 
after the first wife had been declared presumptively dead and after his second 
marriage had been annulled.<span>&nbsp; </span>There may have been compliance with a 
strict or narrow interpretation of the letter of the law but the Court was of 
the view that <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> had failed to live up to the 
high moral standards required for membership in the Bar.</p>
<p class="BODY">All of that, however, is in the past.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> now states that if he has committed an act which 
justified the suspension from taking the lawyer's oath, the time that has 
elapsed is more than sufficient punishment.<span>&nbsp; </span>He submits that "he 
humbly believes with all candor and sincerity that he has more than atoned for 
it by living a very moral and exemplary life since then".</p>
<p class="BODY">Apart from his marital misadventures, there is nothing in the 
records to warrant a permanent denial of <span class="SpellE">Ladrera's</span> 
petition.<span>&nbsp; </span>He worked as a janitor-messenger in 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> while pursuing his college 
education at night.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has also served in fairly important 
positions in the government such as Technical Assistant to President Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, Special Assistant to President Carlos P. Garcia, 
and member and later Chairman of the Board of People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has 
served as Treasurer of the <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span> Walking Corporation 
and Director of the Foreign Affairs Association of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>As early as 1960, then Senator <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> endorsed <span class="SpellE">Ladrera's</span> petition stating that the latter </span>was 
"honest, dependable, and trustworthy" and followed this up with another 
endorsement in 1966.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="7">July 13, 
1966</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> <span class="SpellE">Casas</span> filed a motion for the withdrawal or dismissal of her 
complaint.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Casas</span> stated as her 
"considered opinion" that <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> has been 
sufficiently punished by the then 12-year suspension of his <span class="SpellE">oathtaking</span> as a lawyer.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Casas</span> stated that her children by <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> — <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>, graduating 
with AB and BSC degrees; Belen, preparatory medicine student; and Socorro, Jr. 
an engineering student — were suffering from the stigma of the punishment which 
arose from her complaint.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Casas</span> observed 
that <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> was "behaving well and leading an 
exemplary life".</p>

congressman, and others.<span>&nbsp; </span>A priest, Fr. <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> attested that 
<span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> "is a man of high moral <span class="SpellE">chracter</span>, humble and possessed with an innate religious 
quality; as a consequence thereof he is a daily communicant of the <span class="GramE">blessed sacrament</span>".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the 32 years since <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> passed the 
bar examinations, he has supported and sent through college all his children by 
the three women he married — a daughter by <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Orticio</span>, three children by <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> <span class="SpellE">Casas</span>, and five children by 
Socorro Santos.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of the children have joined their father in 
his many petitions asking for the privilege of taking <span>his

head of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> War Veterans Association and led the 
veterans' movement to acquire some of the lands left by Japanese-owners.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He became a successful businessman in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span>Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span>, acquiring a
