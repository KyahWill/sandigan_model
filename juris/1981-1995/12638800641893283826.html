<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioners are questioning the decision <span style="">or </span>the respondent court of Appeals
sustaining the summary judgment rendered <span style="">by
</span>the Regional Trial Court of Manila in favor of the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that Rule 34
of the Rules of Court is inapplicable because they had in their answer with counterclaim
tendered genuine issues on material facts that called for a full-blown trial on
the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case stemmed from an agreement of the spouses Ignacio and <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span> with <span class="SpellE">Altrima</span> Development Corporation under which <span style="">they </span>bought a lot from the latter on <span style="">which </span>the corporation would construct
a house for them at an agreed price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is admitted by both parties that the lot cost P50,400.00 as evidenced by a Deed
of Absolute Sale dated <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="9">September 2,
 1982</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There is disagreement, however, on the total contract price (including the cost
of the house), <span class="SpellE">Altrima</span> claiming it was P200,000.00
and the spouses insisting it was only P178,400.53</p>

<p class="BODY">In its complaint, <span class="SpellE">Altrima</span> sought to
recover the amount of P36,946.47, for which the defendants had signed a
promissory note, copy of which was annexed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was alleged that the debt had not been paid despite demand, forcing
the plaintiff to litigate and incur the obligation to pay attorney's fees, for
which the defendant should also be held liable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No mention was made of the contract for the house and lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, the defendants admitted the execution of the
promissory note but averred that it did not reflect the true nature of the
transaction and the intent of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As affirmative and special defenses, they referred to the contract for
the house and lot and claimed that the original cost of the house was reduced
to P128,000.00 <span style="">because </span>the
plaintiff's president, Raul <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span>, had secured for
<span style="">them a loan from the Development </span>Bank
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of only P136,300.00 and not P160,000.00 as he had promised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they had already paid the plaintiff
P172,033.53<span style=""> </span>on the contract
price, their balance was only P6,366.47.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendants also counterclaimed for damages due to alleged
construction defects amounting to P37,375.00, and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the answer, the plaintiff filed a motion for
summary judgment on the ground that the defendants had not tendered any genuine
issues of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the motion
were an affidavit for summary judgment, two letters written by Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span> pleading for time within which to pay his debt, a
statement of account from the plaintiff, a reservation agreement made by <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span>, and a certificate of house acceptance also signed by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants filed an opposition,
to which were attached an affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span> denying
the averments in the complaint, a letter from him remitting payment of
P5,000.00 to the plaintiff, several receipts from <span class="SpellE">Altrima</span>,
and a list <span style="">of </span>the claimed
construction defects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff
submitted a reply, to which the defendant filed a rejoinder.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 14, 1985, Judge Manuel T. Reyes granted the motion and
rendered a summary judgment disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendants to pay
the sums of P31,946.47 plus interest at 12% per annum from date of filing of
the instant complaint until fully <span style="">paid;
P2,000.00 </span>as attorney's fees and costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found from the pleadings and evidence submitted
by the parties that there was "no genuine issue as to any material fact,
thereby justifying the plaintiff's prayer for summary judgment." It held
that the correct contract price was P200,000.00, to which was added the amount
of P3,580.00 for extra work on the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of the total indebtedness, the defendants paid the sum of P166,633.53,
leaving a balance of P36,946.47, the face value <span style="">of </span>the promissory note signed <span style="">by </span>the defendants on February 1, 1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amount was reduced later when the
defendants made the additional payment of P5,000.00 on May 30, 1983, <span style="">which </span>was the reason for the award <span style="">of </span>only P31,946.47.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the summary judgment was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">toto</span></u></span><span style=""> by </span>the respondent court,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
prompting the defendants to file this petition for review under Rule 45 of the
Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners urge that the summary judgment be reversed,
insisting that the exact amount of the debt was <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>,
besides the fact that they had filed a counterclaim for an amount exceeding the
plaintiff's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also question
the award of P31,946.47, which did not tally with the claim of either of the
parties, and of the attorney's fee despite the absence of proof of such
expense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has considered the issues and the arguments of the
parties and finds that the petition has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The test for the propriety of a motion for summary judgment is
whether the pleadings, affidavits and exhibits in support of the motion are
sufficient to overcome the opposing papers and to justify the finding that, as
a matter of law, there is no defense to the action or the claim is clearly
meritorious.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, there is absolutely no proof that the
contract price of P200,000.00 was reduced by the parties when the expected loan
of P160,000.00 from the DBP was not fully obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants offered only their self-serving
averments in the letter of May 30, 1983, in which, significantly, Ignacio
categorically stated, "I recognize that I should pay you the
shortfall."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The deed of sale they invoke does not contain their alleged modification of the
contract price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
plaintiff submitted the reservation agreement sighed by Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span>, where the contract price for the house and lot was
clearly stated as P200,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Although demonstrably not signed by the plaintiff, it was at least <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> evidence of the agreed price which has not been satisfactorily
refuted by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, there is the promissory note, which was
executed on <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="2">February <span style="">1, </span>1983</st1:date>, after the parties
learned that the DBP loan had been reduced and construction of the house was
nevertheless continued (and completed).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite such reduction the document still reflected the balance on the
total contract price of P200,000.00 after deduction of the payments made by the
defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said promissory note read in full as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">PROMISSORY NOTE<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote><span style="">+7%

<p class="BODY">If it is true, as the petitioners now insist, that the promissory
note did not correctly state the amount of their indebtedness, the natural
thing for them to do was to make the correction, based on their claimed reduced
contract price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span> later said in his affidavit that he and his wife
signed the promissory note "only to demonstrate to (<span class="SpellE">OIegario</span>)
that we were sincere in our dealings with him even if we knew that we were not
liable for the full amount of the note."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
What he was saying was that he knew <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> was
trying to cheat them but they signed the note just the same to prove that they
were "sincere."</p>

<p class="BODY">The terms of the note also explain the award of P2,000.00
attorney's fees <span style="">as </span>part of the
liquidated damages the defendants also promised to pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, there are the telling admissions made by
Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span> in his letters to the private
respondent dated October 27, 1983, and February 4, <span style="">1984, </span>where he acknowledged his indebtedness without questioning
the amount thereof and begged for more time to pay it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letters are reproduced in full <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>27 October 1983</blockquote>

<blockquote>Architect Raul J. <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>7 <span class="SpellE">Cadena</span> de <span class="SpellE">Amor</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pilar</span></span><span style=""> Village<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Almanza</span>, Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, Metro Manila</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear Raul,</blockquote>

<blockquote>When I received your letter last week, I felt <span style="">a </span>deep embarrassment and sadness even
before I opened the envelop - embarrassment because to date I have been unable
to find a way to settle this obligation and sadness because I understand your
position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I must confess, however, that as of now, I have no choice but to
ask for more time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You would also
understand that <span style="">a </span>lot of
unexpected events really led to the predicament I am in right now, including
those mentioned in my May 30th letter to you, plus the fact that PHILEC did not
pay me the amount I was expecting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter
of fact, PHILEC has turned around and is asking me to pay a balance of
P200,000.00 on the car I am using before they release the mortgage on the car.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I also had hoped to be able to start paying you even in
installments starting last July because as you may remember, I mentioned in our
last conversation that <span style="">I </span>was
working on <span style="">a </span>project wherein <span style="">I </span>would be taken in as industrial
partner with a salary for managing the project and <span style="">a </span>percentage of the profits <span style="">as </span>industrial partner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the deal did not materialize and I now have to start
looking again for a means or livelihood.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As it is now, I face the terrifying prospect of losing the house
and lot since I have not been able to pay installments to DBP (which has first
lien on the property) and to my wife's aunt (who has second lien).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Please believe that I want to settle my obligations to all
concerned as soon as humanly possible because <span style="">I </span>look upon the property as the only thing I could leave to my
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">So </span>you can rest assured I am doing my best to find a source of
income so I can pay my debts.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Sincerely,<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear Atty. <span class="SpellE">Arceño</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In reply to your letter dated January <span style="">4, 1984, </span>we regret that we have no recourse but to ask for more
time since I am still in the process of looking for <span style="">a means </span>of livelihood and I have at present no means of paying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Please understand <span style="">as </span>I
have pointed out to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> that this situation
arose out <span style="">of </span>a combination <span style="">of </span>circumstances that we both did not
want.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been quite sincere in my
dealings with Mr. <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> from the start when <span style="">I </span>told him that all <span style="">I </span>could put up as equity in <span style="">the purchase or the house and lot was the
P50,000.00<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would borrow from my wife's
aunt and this is the reason we agreed he would obtain a loan of P160,000.00 for
me from the DBP under the Open Housing loan program.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Records will show that I have paid this
amount but unfortunately, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> was able to
obtain only a P136,000.00 loan.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">But again, as a show of
good faith, when Mr. <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> asked me to sign </span>a
<span style="">promissory note for around P37,000.00
representing the balance resulting from the above-cited events, I signed
without question, pointing out to him that it was an expression of my
willingness and intent to pay the balance without questioning the legal
technicalities of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But at
the same time I asked him for time to find a means of livelihood since
unexpectedly, I lost my job last March as </span>a <span style="">result of the retrenchment of my employer.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">What has happened is much
against our wishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I have assured
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> in my previous letters, I am exerting
all efforts to find employment or business opportunities so as to be able to
settle my obligations as soon as humanly possible.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>I <span style="">beg for your
consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Very truly yours,<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>.) IGNACIO </span>G.
S<span style="">UGAY, JR.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Already mentioned is the letter of May 30, 1983, where Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span> admitted the obligation to pay "the
shortfall."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that a summary judgment may not be rendered if the
counterclaim is for a sum larger than that demanded in the complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
but this rule applies only where the counterclaim is valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
not in the case before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counterclaim
is based on alleged construction defects which were not earlier protested by
the petitioners in any of their communications with the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not mention them in
their certificate </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">house acceptance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it be supposed that they were
"hidden" defects, it is curious that they were discovered only on
July 26, 1984, and by a professional construction company</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">hired

only an afterthought intended to put </span><span style="">off </span><span style="">the collection of the
private respondent's legitimate claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

delay the proceedings to the prejudice of the parties and the speedy
