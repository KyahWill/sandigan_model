				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The victim was dead on the ground with no less than 25 hack
wounds, many of them fatal.  Investigation pointed to the two appellants as the assailants.  Charged with murder, they were arraigned,
tried, convicted, and penalized accordingly.  The decision of the trial court is now before us on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at her decision,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Judge
Evangeline S. Yuipco of the Regional Trial Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Agusan </span>del Sur relied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">heavily
and mainly on the testimony of prosecution witness Melchor Goloran.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This witness testified that in the afternoon of August 2, 1989,
he was plowing the land of Tortiliano Osin at Caridad, Prosperidad, Agusan del
Sur, when he saw the killing of Favio Goloran.  According to him, Vicente Curato was behind Favio when he hacked the
victim on the left shoulder, causing him to fall.  Salvador Osigan, who was facing Favio, also hacked him.  Favio was able to run about seven meters but
his two attackers pursued him.  Both of
them carried bolos about 45 to 50 inches long.  All this he clearly saw, he declared, because he was only about fifteen
meters away.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two other prosecution witnesses also claimed to have witnessed
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">incident, </span>but they had a
different version.  These were Vicente
Goloran and Roy Osigan, appellant Salvador Osigan's younger brother.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">These two witnesses
testified that on August 2, 1989, at about 4:30 p.m., they were drinking </span><u>tuba</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">with Salvador when Favio approached
them and demanded to know why Salvador was siding with Curato in the latter's
controversy with Favio.  As Salvador's
reply was unsatisfactory to Favio, the two simultaneously started </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hacking </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">at each other with their bolos, which were each about 20 inches
long.  Salvador bested Favio, who
sustained many wounds and died as a result.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both Vicente Goloran and Roy Osigan declared that Vicente Curato
was <u>not</u> present during the incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, Curato pleaded alibi, claiming that at the time
of the incident in question he and his son were fencing their lot at Bahbah,
Prosperidad, also in Agusan del Sur, and that he learned of the killing of
Favio only the following day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> He
was corroborated by Felixberto Dagatan, who swore that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">when he </span>went to buy cigarettes at Curato's store at around 3:30
p.m. of that day, he saw Curato working on the fence.  He added that Curato and his son stopped fencing their lot at
about 5:30 that same afternoon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Salvador Osigan testified that in the afternoon of
August 2, 1989, he was drinking <u>tuba</u> with his brother Roy and Vicente
Goloran when Favio approached them and berated him for siding with Curato.  Rejecting his reply, Favio drew his bolo and
struck him on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>left cheek,
drawing blood that dimmed his vision.  In self-defense, he drew his own bolo and started fighting back,
continuing to do so even after Favio had fallen to the ground.  Osigan said he was confined in a hospital
for about a week, after which he surrendered to the police.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A study of the above-discussed testimonies will readily show that
there is no evidence to convict Vicente Curato of murder, or of any other crime
for that matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that alibi is an inherently weak defense, such
defense has been amply established in this case.  In fact, it did not have to be established at all since, in the
view of the Court, the prosecution evidence has not overcome the constitutional
presumption of innocence in favor of Curato.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Significantly, </span>the
other two prosecution eyewitnesses both testified that Curato was not present
when Favio was killed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> Both
said it was Osigan who killed Favio.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As for Melchor Goloran, the only witness who implicated Curato,
the Court finds his credibility hardly acceptable.  His declaration that both Curato and Osigan were carrying bolos
45 to 50 inches long is especially unbelievable.  That would make the bolos about four feet long, longer than a <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">kampilan</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span>or a saber.  Farmers do
not usually carry such extraordinary weapons.  The Court also notes Apolinaria Goloran's testimony that on the day of
the killing, Melchor Goloran could not have been plowing Osin's land because he
had already been replaced by Salvador Osigan.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming he was really on Osin's land at the time, Melchor
Goloran was by his own admission some fifteen meters away from the scene of the
incident.  By contrast, Roy Osigan and
Vicente Goloran, who said Curato was not present, were immediately in front of
Favio and Salvador when they started fighting each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Salvador Osigan, the burden of proof shifted to him after
his admission of the killing of Favio.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> His
proffered justification is an affirmative allegation that must be proven with
certainty by sufficient, satisfactory and convincing evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He has not presented such evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds it difficult to accept his plea of self-defense,
considering that while he sustained only a single minor wound, Favio was hacked
as many as twenty-five times, in the neck and chest, and even on the back, when
he was already lying face down on the ground.  Only Salvador testified that it was Favio who began the unlawful
aggression when the latter allegedly hit him on the left cheek.  No one else did.  Not even his own brother Roy testified to such aggression, and
neither did the other prosecution eyewitnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">As unlawful aggression has not been established, it is not
necessary to prove the other elements of self-defense, to wit, reasonable
necessity of the means employed to resist the aggression and lack of sufficient
provocation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>The defense counsel should have known
he was engaging in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a </span>futile
exercise.  In fact, even incomplete
self-defense is not available to Osigan because this mitigating circumstance
requires, as an essential and indispensable element, proof of unlawful
aggression.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> This </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">also elementary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The crime </span>committed
by Osigan is, however, not murder as charged because the prosecution has failed
to prove the alleged qualifying circumstance of treachery.  That circumstance was sought to be
established through the testimony of Melchor Goloran  which has, however, been discredited.  No other prosecution witness has testified to such treachery; on
the contrary, the other alleged eyewitnesses declared under oath that Favio and
Salvador simultaneously started hacking at each other.  Lacking such qualifying circumstance, the
killing of Favio by Osigan must be described only as homicide, attended by the
mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is REVERSED as to VICENTE
CURATO, who is hereby ACQUITTED and ordered released immediately, and MODIFIED
as to Salvador Osigan, who is declared guilty of HOMICIDE only instead of
murder and is meted an indeterminate sentence of nine (9) years and one (1) day
of <u>prison mayor</u>, as minimum, to thirteen (13) years, four (4) months and
one (1) day of <u>reclusion temporal</u>, as maximum.  No costs.</p>
