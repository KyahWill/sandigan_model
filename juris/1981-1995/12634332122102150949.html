				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is <span style="">a </span>petition
for <i>certiorari</i> which seeks to annul the resolution of the Third Division
of the respondent Sandiganbayan dated 30 September 1991 issued in Civil Case
No. 0110 denying petitioner's motion to consolidate the said case with Civil
Case No. 0033 pending before the First Division of the same court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In April and May 1986, the petitioner Presidential Commi<span style="">s</span>sion on Good Government (PCGG, for
brevity) issued several orders for the sequestration of the San Miguel
Corporation (SMC) shares registered and issued in the name of respondent
companies.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The sequestration of said shares of stock was made pursuant to the provisions
of the Freedom Constitution which empowered the President of the Philippines to
recover ill-gotten properties of the Marcoses and their supporters, by
sequestration or freezing of assets and accounts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 31 July 1987, the PCGG filed an action with the Sandiganbayan
against Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr., Ferdinand <span style="">E.
</span>Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos and several other individuals, for
reconveyance, reversion, accounting, and restitution of alleged ill-gotten
wealth (with damages) consisting of funds and other properties which said
defendants allegedly acquired and accumulated in flagrant breach of trust of
their fiduciary obligations as public officers.  The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 0033 and raffled to the
First Division of the Sandiganbayan.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 8 October 1990, respondent companies filed an action
(petition) for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and injunction with the
Sandiganbayan, docketed as Civil Case No. 0110, and raffled to its Third
Division, seeking the lifting of the writs of sequestration over the SMC shares
owned by them.  Respondent companies
claimed that the said sequestration of their SMC shares is void for failure of
PCGG to comply with the constitutional mandate (Section 23, Article XVIII of
the 1987 Constitution) which requires that for orders of seques­tration issued
before the ratification of the 1987 Constitu­tion, a judicial action must be
filed within six (6) months from the ratification of said Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG in Civil Case No. 0110 filed its answer,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

and amended opposition to the motion for issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, the PCGG filed an amendment to its complaint in Civil Case No.
0033, this time impleading eighty (80) additional defendants which include
herein respondent companies.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the resolution of the respondent companies' motion for
issuance of <span style="">a </span>writ of
preliminary injunction (in Civil Case No. 0110) was held in abeyance by the
Sandigan­bayan,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the trial of said Civil Case No. 0110 proceeded; the respondent companies
presented their evidence and formally offered the same on 30 July 1991.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the formal offer of evidence by respondent companies in Civil
Case No. 0110, PCGG on 16 August 1991 filed with the Third Division of
respondent court a motion to consolidate Civil Case No. 0110 with Civil Case
No. 0033 in the First Division.  Said
motion was opposed by respondent companies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 September 1991, the Sandiganbayan (Third Divi­sion) denied
PCGG's motion to consolidate the aforementioned two (2) cases for the following
reasons:</p>

<blockquote>"Firstly, the issues involved in the cases are different.  As the pleadings show, the issues involved
in the instant case are:  whether there
existed a prima facie case to warrant the sequestration of the petitioners' SMC
shares of stock at the time the orders of sequestration were issued, and
whether the said SMC shares of stock should remain under sequestration
notwithstanding that no judicial action was filed against petitioners in
accordance with Section 26, Article XVIII, of the Constitution.  On the other hand, the issue in Civil Case
No. 0033 is whether the properties of the defendants subject matter of the case
are 'ill-gotten wealth';</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Secondly, this case involves only shares of stock of the
petitioners in the San Miguel Corporation whereas Civil Case No. 0033 involves
various properties like agricultural lands, houses, motor vehicles, airplanes,
residential lands, condominium units, fishponds, coconut plantations, and
shares of stocks not only in the SMC but also in other corporations;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thirdly, the instant case is an action for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and injunction against respondent PCGG for allegedly acting in
violation of both the Constitution and the law, without or in excess of
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, in sequestering the petitioners
shares of stock in the SMC.  Civil Case
No. 0033, on the other hand, is an action for reconveyance, reversion, accounting
restitution and damages arising from breach of public trust, abuse of right and
power and unjust enrichment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fourthly, the parties in the two cases are not identical
since the forty-three petitioners in the instant case are only among the more than
a hundred defendants in Civil Case No. 0033;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lastly, records show that the petitioners in the instant case
have already presented and formally offered their evidence and respondent <span style="">PCGG </span>will shortly start presenting its
own evidence; Civil Case No. 0033 has not yet passed the pre-trial conference
stage." <a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition by the PCGG.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner PCGG argues that the parties, subject matters, issues
and the evidence to be presented in Civil Case No. 0033 and Civil Case No. 0110
are similar, which fact warrants the consolidation of the two (2) civil cases;
and that the refusal of said Third Division of the Sandiganbayan to order the
consolidation of the two (2) cases is a grave abuse of discretion on its part.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 0033 filed by petitioner PCGG against Eduardo
Cojuangco, Jr., Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos and several of the
individuals and corporations, the complaint is mainly for the recovery,
reconveyance, accounting and restitution of funds and properties allegedly
acquired by illegal means by said defendants in breach of public trust; whereas
in Civil Case No. 0110, respondent companies assail the validity of the PCGG's
sequestration of the SMC shares issued and registered in their names.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in said two (2) cases are not identical, though
admittedly, the facts and circumstances involved in the cases are
intertwined.  But the resolution of the
issue on the validity of the sequestration of the SMC shares registered in the
name of respondent companies will not prevent PCGG from pursuing the case for
recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth from respondent companies and several
other individuals, which is the cause of action in Civil Case No. 0033.</p>

<p class="BODY">As observed by the Sandiganbayan, in the action for reconveyance
(Civil Case No. 0033), the objects sought to be recovered are various
properties and funds, while in Civil Case No. 0110, the object is limited to
the sequestered SMC shares issued in the name of respondent companies.  Furthermore, the fact that respondent
companies were sub­sequently impleaded as party defendants in the reconveyance
case does not by itself warrant the consolidation of the two (2) cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main object of consolidation is to avoid multi­plicity of
suits, guard against oppression or abuse, prevent delay, clear congested
dockets, simplify the work of the trial court and save unnecessary costs and
expense.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
However, where a case has been already partially tried before one judge, the
consolidation of the same with another related case pending before another
judge who had no opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses during
trial makes con­solidation not mandatory.  In the case of <u>PAL v. Teodoro</u> <a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>,
the consolidation of two (2) cases was not allowed by the Court because one of
the cases had already been partially heard by a judge different from the judge
who would hear the cases, if consolidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 0110, the Third Division of the Sandiganbayan
has partially heard the case.  In fact,
respon­dent companies have already rested their case and made a formal offer of
their evidence.  To consolidate Civil
Case No. 0110 assailing the validity of the sequestration of respondent
companies' SMC shares with Civil Case No. 0033 for reconveyance of alleged
ill-gotten wealth, would only delay the whole proceeding.  It is a fact that the reconveyance case is
only at its pre-trial stage.  Considering also that in Civil Case No. 0033 there are several
respondents involved and the properties and funds sought to be recovered are
enormous, the consolidation of Civil Case No. 0110 with Civil Case No. 0033 at
this point would only succeed to delay the resolution of the issue on the
validity of the sequestration of the SMC shares issued in the respective names
of respon­dent companies.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore clear that in denying the consolidation of Civil
Case No. 0110 with Civil Case No. 0033 as prayed for by petitioner PCGG, the
respondent Sandiganbayan (Third Division) did not act with grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be made clear, however, that nothing in this decision
precludes or estops the petitioner PCGG from pursuing Civil Case No. 0033 in
the Sandiganbayan, to recover from the respondent companies the SMC shares in
question on the basis of its allegation therein that they are ill-gotten
wealth.</p>
