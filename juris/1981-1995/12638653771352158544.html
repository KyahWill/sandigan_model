				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G.R. No. SP-10524 which affirmed the decision of the then Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, Branch IX, affirming the <span class="GramE">judgment</span> of the City
Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents spouses Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cifra</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Cifra</span> leased
an apartment building located at 11-C Purdue Street, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, to herein petitioners spouses <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ercillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ercillo</span> at a monthly
rental of P140.00 payable within the first five (5) days of the month at the
residence of private <span style="">respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="11"><span style="">November
 </span>23, 1976</st1:date>, private respondents filed an <span style="">action </span>for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
with the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged in the complaint that the
petitioners failed to pay the rentals for the month of August, 1976 up to the
filing of the complaint; that private respondents demanded from petitioners
payment of the accrued rentals and the surrender of the possession of the
leased premises to them before the complaint was filed and that the petitioners
neither paid the accrued rentals nor surrendered the possession of the leased <span style="">premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, on the other hand, alleged that they never defaulted
in the payment of their rentals; that private respondents refused to accept
their payments; that they deposited the payments with the Family Savings Bank,
Account No. 419022473, in the name of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ercillo</span> or Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Cifra</span> and that the petitioners were advised by the former
of the said deposit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime also in November, 1976, the private respondents filed a
complaint against the petitioners with the Office of the Civil Relations (OCR),
Philippine Constabulary at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners then withdrew the rentals
deposited with the Family Savings Bank and deposited the money and the accruing
rentals with the OCR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the action for
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> was pending with the City Court, the
petitioners deposited the rentals with the said court.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the City Court rendered a decision in favor of
private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
decision <span style="">provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
this Court finds the material allegations in the complaint filed in this case
to be duly proved with convincing and satisfactory evidence and rendered
judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against defendants spouses TEOFILO ERCILLO
and TERESITA ERCILLO, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering
defendants and all persons claiming rights under them to vacate the premises
located at 11-C Purdue Street, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and restore the peaceful possession thereof to
plaintiffs;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering
defendants, jointly and severally, to pay plaintiffs the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,680.00</span> representing accrued monthly rentals for the period
August, 1976 to July 1977 at P144.00 a month;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering defendants,
jointly and severally, to pay plaintiffs the further sum of P144.00 a month
commencing on August 1, 1977 and every month thereafter until they and all
persons claiming rights under them finally vacate the premises and restore the
peaceful possession thereof to plaintiffs;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering defendants
jointly and severally, to pay the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, as
and for <span style="">attorney's </span>fees; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering
defendants, jointly and severally, to pay the costs of the suit.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The counter-claim interposed by the defendants is hereby
dismissed for lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (pp. 14-15, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rollo</span></span><span style="">)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Seventh Judicial District, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, the decision of the
City Court was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">toto</span></u></span><span style="">.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners filed a petition for review with respondent Court
of Appeals which dismissed the petition for lack of merit in a decision
promulgated on <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1980</st1:date>
(pp. 14-18, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
decision of the Court of Appeals stated:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Since the consignation of the accrued rentals with the Court
was made only during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, although they (petitioners) had effected
deposits with the Office of the Civil Relations, which office as opined by the
trial court, "is not a judicial authority," such act could not have
and did not have the effect of discharging petitioners' obligation in the
payment of rentals.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Thus, no judicial consignation having been
made in accordance with Art.</span> 1256, 1257 and 1258 of the New Civil Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, for lack of merit the instant petition for review
is hereby DISMISSED.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SO ORDERED.”</span> (p. 18, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioners filed the instant petition with this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that respondent Court of Appeals
committed a legal error when it ruled that the deposit of the rentals with the
bank did not release the petitioners from their obligation to pay the rentals and
that LOI 768 which took effect only on <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="11">November
 16, 1978</st1:date> cannot apply to this case which was filed on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the
private respondents had a valid ground for ejecting petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ground raised by private respondents in ejecting petitioners
from the leased premises is the latter's failure to pay rents due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that this is one of the
grounds by which a <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> may judicially eject the lessee
under Article 1673 of the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, Section 2, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court requires that a <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> or his legal representative shall bring an action
against a lessee for failure to pay rent due only after the lessee shall have
failed to pay such rent for a period of fifteen days after a written demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> had been made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents assert that there was no payment of the rent due
within the fifteen (15) day period prescribed by the rules nor even after the
lapse of the fifteen (15) day period after a written demand to pay and to
vacate was made on petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, for their part, assert that their obligation to
pay rent had been extinguished in view of their consignation of the rent due
with the bank after the private respondents refused to accept them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law on tender of payment and consignation as a mode of
extinguishing <span class="GramE">an obligations</span> is covered by Article
1256, Article 1257 and Article 1258 of the New Civil Code.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1256.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
creditor to <span class="GramE">whom</span> tender of payment has been made
refuses without just cause to accept it, the debtor shall be released from
responsibility by the consignation of the thing or sum due.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1257. In order that the consignation <span style="">of the </span>thing due may release the
obligor, it must first be announced to the persons interested in the
fulfillment of the obligation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The consignation shall be ineffectual if it <span style="">is </span>not made strictly in consonance
with the provisions which regulate payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1258. Consignation shall be made <span style="">by </span>depositing the things due at the disposal of judicial
authority before <span class="GramE">whom</span> the tender of payment shall be
proved, in a proper case, and the announcement of the consignation in other
cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The consignation having been made, the interested parties
shall also be notified thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the requirement under Article 1258 which had not been
strictly <span class="GramE">complied</span> with by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the law requires is the deposit of the
thing due at the disposal of judicial authority before <span class="GramE">whom</span>
the tender of payment shall be proved, in a proper case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deposit of the rentals with the bank is <span style="">not </span>the consignation contemplated by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Depositing the rentals in the bank
does not place such rental at the disposal of the judicial authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue further that since the case is still pending,
the full legal effect of P.D. 20 together with its implementing Instructions,
LOI 768, should be made to apply in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">P.D. <span class="GramE">20,</span> issued on <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1972</st1:date>, amended Republic Act No. 6359
regulating rentals for dwelling <span style="">units.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It was not until <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1978</st1:date> when Letter of Instruction No.
768 was issued implementing P.D. 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
provided, among others:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following shall not constitute grounds for
judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of lessees:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the lessee has
failed to pay any increased rental not mutually agreed upon; provided, that in
case of refusal of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to accept payment of
the rent previously agreed upon, the lessee shall either <span class="SpellE">consignate</span>
the amount in court or deposit the said amount in a bank for the account of the
<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners seek shelter under this provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it should be noted that LOI 768
which allows the deposit of accrued rentals in a bank as an alternative to
consignation in court of rental payments which the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
refuses to accept, was issued only on <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="11">November
 16, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, on the other hand was filed on November 23, 1976
or some two (2) years before the issuance of LOI 768 when the law in effect
then was Article 1257 of the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, the private respondents had, at the time of the institution of
the complaint, a valid ground for ejecting petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
