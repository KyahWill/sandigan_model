answered in the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, the three (3) armed men ordered <span class="SpellE">Quijan's</span>
wife and his two children to go downstairs (about 2 meters away from the dining
table) which they heeded.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately thereafter, the man with a long gun fired several times upon
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Quijan</span>, followed by
the other two (2) men with short guns – after which they fled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Quijan</span> died as a result of the multiple gunshot wounds he

together with six (6) other detainees and asked him if any of the said
detainees was his father's assassin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Ronadin</span> <span class="SpellE">Quijan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Wilnor</span> <span class="SpellE">Quijan</span> by pointing out
that they are the children of the deceased and that it is but natural that in
their desire to avenge the death of their father, they could easily fall prey
to their uncle's desire to concoct evidence if only to point to someone as
responsible for the death of their father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The uncle is a member of the Civilian Home Defense Force (CHDF).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant-appellant's contention is unten­able.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an established doctrine that mere rela­tionship
of prosecution witnesses to the victim does not make their testimony biased nor
render it utterly devoid of belief in the absence of an improper motive
actuating the witnesses to testify falsely against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Puesca</span></u>,

<p class="BODY">In <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span></u> (106 <u>SCRA</u>

<blockquote>"As to the alleged suspicious character of <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>'s
testimony because she is the daughter of the victim, it is to be noted that
appellant does not specifically point to any portion of her testimony which may
render it doubtful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no reason at all to reject the finding and
conclusion of the trial court regarding her credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, suffice it to say that
relationship to the victim, standing by itself, does not prove that the said
witness is prejudiced and biased when, as in this case, said testimony is not
only clear and natural, but corroborated circumstantially by medical
findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Estocada</span>,

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the records and we find no reason
either from the facts or from the appellant's arguments why the prevailing

credible, clear, and positive statements.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record is bereft of any circumstance from which we can infer
that the testimonies of the <span class="SpellE">Quijan</span> children are mere

identification of the defendant-appellant as one of the killers of their
father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Gacho</span>
lives in a neighboring area and used to pass by their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Quijan</span> house is
