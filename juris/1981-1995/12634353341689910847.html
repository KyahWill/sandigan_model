BASCOS, doing business under the name of BASCOS TRUCKING, defendant-appellant,”
C.A.-G.R. CV No. 25216, the dispositive portion of which is quoted hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES considered, We find no reversible error in the

<p class="BODY">The facts, as gathered by this Court, are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Rodolfo A. Cipriano representing Cipriano Trading Enterprise
(CIPTRADE for short) entered into a hauling contract<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
with Jibfair Shipping Agency Corporation whereby the former bound itself to
haul the latter's 2,000 m/tons of soya bean meal from Magallanes Drive, Del Pan,
Manila to the warehouse of Purefoods Corporation in Calamba, Laguna.  To carry out its obligation, CIPTRADE,
through Rodolfo Cipriano, subcontracted with Estrellita Bascos (petitioner) to
transport and to deliver 400 sacks of soya bean meal worth P156,404.00 from the
Manila Port Area to Calamba, Laguna at the rate of P50.00 per metric ton.  Petitioner failed to deliver the said
cargo.  As a consequence of that
failure, Cipriano paid Jibfair Shipping Agency the amount of the lost goods in
accordance with the contract which stated that:<span style="letter-spacing:

<blockquote>"1.  CIPTRADE shall be
held liable and answerable for any loss in bags due to theft, hijacking and

<p class="BODY">Cipriano demanded reimbursement from petitioner but the latter
refused to pay.  Eventually, Cipriano
filed a complaint for a sum of money and damages with writ of preliminary
attachment<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
for breach of a contract of carriage.  The prayer for a Writ of Preliminary Attachment was supported by an
affidavit<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

preliminary attachment on February 17, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">In her answer, petitioner interposed
the following defenses: that there was no contract of carriage since CIPTRADE
leased her cargo truck to load the cargo from Manila Port Area to Laguna; that
CIPTRADE was liable to petitioner in the amount of P11,000.00 for loading the
cargo; that the truck carrying the cargo was hijacked along Canonigo St., Paco,
Manila on the night of October 21, 1988; that the hijacking was immediately
reported to CIPTRADE and that petitioner and the police exerted all efforts to
locate the hijacked properties; that after preliminary investigation, an
information for robbery and carnapping were filed against Jose Opriano, et al.;
and that hijacking, being a force majeure, exculpated petitioner from any
liability to CIPTRADE.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">After trial, the trial court rendered
a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The petition presents the following issues for resolution: (1)
was petitioner a common carrier?; and (2) was the hijacking referred to a force
majeure?</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, in holding that petitioner was a common
carrier, found that she admitted in her answer that she did business under the
name A.M. Bascos Trucking and that said admission dispensed with the
presentation by private respondent, Rodolfo Cipriano, of proofs that petitioner
was a common carrier.  The respondent
Court also adopted <i>in toto</i> the trial court's decision that petitioner
was a common carrier.  Moreover, both
courts appreciated the following pieces of evidence as indicators that
petitioner was a common carrier: the fact that the truck driver of petitioner,
Maximo Sanglay, received the cargo consisting of 400 bags of soya bean meal as
evidenced by a cargo receipt signed by Maximo Sanglay; the fact that the truck
helper, Juanita Morden, was also an employee of petitioner; and the<span style="letter-spacing:.6pt"> </span>fact that control of the cargo was placed
in petitioner's care.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">In disputing the conclusion of
the trial and appellate </span>courts that petitioner was a common carrier, she
alleged in this petition that the contract between her and Rodolfo A. <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Cipriano, representing CIPTRADE, was lease of the
truck.  </span>She cited as evidence
certain affidavits which referred to <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">the
contract as "lease".</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">  These affidavits were made by </span><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Jesus Bascos</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;letter-spacing:.3pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> and by petitioner herself.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;letter-spacing:.3pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> She further </span>averred that Jesus Bascos
confirmed in his testimony his <span style="letter-spacing:.55pt">statement
that the contract was a lease contract.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;letter-spacing:.55pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing:.55pt"> She </span>also stated that she was not catering
to the general public.  Thus, in her
answer to the amended complaint, she said that <span style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">she does</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> business under the
same style of A.M. Bascos</span><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:.45pt">Trucking, offering her trucks for lease to those
who have </span><span style="letter-spacing:.85pt">cargo to move, not to the
general public but to a few </span>customers only in view of the fact that it
is only a small business.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the respondent Court in its finding that petitioner
is a common carrier.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1732 of the Civil Code defines a common carrier as
"(a) person, corporation or firm, or association engaged in the business
of carrying or transporting passengers or goods or both, by land, water or air,
for compensation, offering their services to the public." The test to
determine a common carrier is "whether the given undertaking is a part of
the business engaged in by the carrier which he has held out to the general
public as his occupation rather than the quantity or extent of the business
transacted."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, petitioner herself has made the admission that she was in the
trucking business, offering her trucks to those with cargo to move.  Judicial admissions are conclusive and no
evidence is required to prove the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioner argues that there was only a contract of lease because
they offer their services only to a select group of people and because the
private respondents, plaintiffs in the lower court, did not object to the
presentation of affidavits by petitioner where the transaction was referred to
as a lease contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the first contention, the holding of the Court in <u>De
Guzman vs. Court of Appeals</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
is instructive.  In referring to Article
1732 of the Civil Code, it held thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">"The above article makes no
distinction </span>between one whose <i>principal</i> business activity is the
carrying of persons or goods or both, and one who does such carrying only as an
<i><u>ancillary</u></i> activity (in local idiom, as a
"sideline").  Article 1732
also carefully avoids making any distinction between a person or enterprise
offering transportation service on a <i>regular or scheduled basis</i> and one
offering such service on<span style="letter-spacing:.4pt"> </span>an <i>occasional,
episodic or unscheduled basis</i>.  Neither does Article 1732 distinguish between a carrier offering its
services to the "<i>general public</i>," i.e., the general community
or population, and one who offers services or solicits business only from a
narrow <i>segment</i> of the general population.  We think that Article 1732 deliberately refrained from making
such distinctions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the affidavits presented by petitioner to the court,
both the trial and appellate courts have dismissed them as self-serving and
petitioner contests the conclusion.  We
are bound by the appellate court's factual conclusions.  Yet, granting that the said evidence were
not self-serving, the same were not sufficient to prove that the contract was
one of lease.  It must be understood
that a contract is what the law defines it to be and not what it is called by
the contracting parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;letter-spacing:-.05pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, petitioner presented no other proof of the existence of the contract
of lease.  He who alleges a fact has the
burden of proving it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;letter-spacing:-.05pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Likewise, We affirm the
holding of the respondent court </span>that the loss of the goods was not due
to force majeure.</p>

<p class="BODY">Common carriers are obliged to observe extraordinary diligence in
the vigilance over the goods transported by them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, they are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted
negligently if the goods are lost, <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">destroyed
or deteriorated.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;letter-spacing:.3pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> </span>There are very few instances <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">when the presumption of negligence does not attach
and these </span>instances are enumerated in Article 1734.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In those cases where the presumption is applied, the common carrier must prove
that it exercised extraordinary diligence in order to overcome the presumption.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, petitioner alleged that hijacking constituted force
majeure which exculpated her from liability for the loss of the cargo.  In <u>De Guzman vs. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held that hijacking, not being included in the provisions of Article
1734, must be dealt with under the<span style="letter-spacing:.7pt"> </span>provisions
of Article 1735 and<span style="letter-spacing:.7pt"> thus, </span>the common
carrier is presumed to have been at fault or negligent.  To exculpate the carrier from liability
arising from hijacking, he must prove that the robbers or the hijackers acted
with grave or irresistible threat, violence, or force.  This is in accordance with Article 1745 of
the Civil Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1745.  Any of the
following or similar stipulations shall be considered unreasonable, unjust and
contrary to public policy:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x <span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x
x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6) That the common carrier's liability for acts committed by
thieves, or of robbers who do not act with grave or irresistible threat,
violences or force, is dispensed with or diminished;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the same case,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
the Supreme Court also held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Under Article 1745 (6) above, a common
carrier is held responsible--and will not be allowed to divest or to diminish
such responsibility--even for acts of strangers like thieves or robbers, <i>except</i>
where such thieves or robbers in fact acted "with grave or irresistible
threat, violence or force." We believe and so hold that the limits of the
duty of extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the goods carried are
reached where the goods are lost as a result of a robbery which is attended by
"grave or irresistible threat, violence or force."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To establish grave and irresistible force, petitioner presented
her accusatory affidavit,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Jesus Bascos' affidavit,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and Juanito Morden's<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
"Salaysay".  However, both the
trial court and the Court of Appeals have concluded that these affidavits were
not enough to overcome the presumption.  Petitioner's affidavit about the hijacking was based on what had been
told her by Juanito Morden.  It was not
a first-hand account.  While it had been
admitted in court for lack of objection on the part of private respondent, the
respondent Court had discretion in assigning weight to such evidence.  We are bound by the conclusion of the
appellate court.  In a petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i>, We are not to determine the probative value of
evidence but to resolve questions of law.  Secondly, the affidavit of Jesus Bascos did not dwell on how the
hijacking took place.  Thirdly, while
the affidavit of Juanito Morden, the truck helper in the hijacked truck, was
presented as evidence in court, he himself was a witness as could be gleaned
from the contents of the petition.  Affidavits are not considered the best evidence if the affiants are
available as witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
The subsequent filing of the information for carnapping and robbery against the
accused named in said affidavits did not necessarily mean that the contents of
the affidavits were true because they were yet to be determined in the trial of
the criminal cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption of negligence was raised against petitioner.  It was petitioner's burden to overcome
it.  Thus, contrary to her assertion,
private respondent need not introduce any evidence to prove her
negligence.  Her own failure to adduce
sufficient proof of extraordinary diligence made the presumption conclusive
against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having affirmed the findings of the respondent Court on the
substantial issues involved, We find no reason to disturb the conclusion that
the motion to lift/dissolve the writ of preliminary attachment has been
rendered moot and academic by the decision on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing analysis, it is Our opinion that
the petitioner's claim cannot be sustained.  The petition is DISMISSED and the decision of the Court of Appeals is
hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
