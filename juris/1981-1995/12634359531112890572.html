of Roxas City for the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. C-3070 thereof.  Deplorably, that conviction also stands as a
societal indictment, for the unfortunate victim, Goldie Ruth T. Fuentes, was
only five years of age at the time.</p>

<p class=BODY>The sworn complaint initiated by the girl's grandmother and
guardian, Fedelina A. Tan, and the corresponding information signed by
Assistant City Prosecutor Victor C. Posadas, both of which were filed before
the said trial court on January 5, 1990, charged that on December 30, 1990,
appellant willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of Goldie
Ruth T. Fuentes in Roxas City.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"

<p class=BODY>Appellant was apprehended by elements of the Roxas City Police
Force a few hours after the incident at the place where the rape allegedly took
place.  Although no bail was recommended
by the prosecution for his temporary release, appellant nonetheless prayed that
he &quot;be granted bail in the amount of P40,000.00.&quot; The trial court
consequently set the application for hearing on January 15, 1990, with the
stipulation that the evidence adduced therein would be considered part of the
evidence in the trial on the merits.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'

<p class=BODY>On February 9, 1990, the trial court issued an order denying
appellant's application for bail.  The
court opined that the prosecution had clearly established a <i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>prima facie</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=BODY>The factual antecedents of the present case, as established by
the evidence, are well recounted by the trial court in its decision and are
best reproduced hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;In her testimony, the alleged victim of rape, Goldie Ruth
Fuentes, at 5 a girl of very tender age and a kindergarten pupil, told the
court that as of December 30, 1989, she was living with and under the care of
her maternal grandparents who were operating a store at Roxas Avenue, Roxas
City, because her parents were working abroad.  Her mother was working in Italy and her father was in Hongkong.  In terms surprisingly clear and unambiguous
for a child so young and tender, she related before the court her story.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;At about 12 noon of December 30, 1989, she and a playmate,
Temar Hoo, also a girl about her age, were playing ‘monkey-monkey’, jumping up
and down in a small hut standing on a vacant lot behind a bakeshop in Roxas
Avenue, Roxas City, near her grandparents' store.  Suddenly, accused Ricky Sueta whom she identified and pointed to
in court asked her and Temar to play a game couples play.  Sueta was lying down on the flooring of the
hut and he told her to sit on his thighs, at the same time pulling down her
panties.  And then Sueta inserted, to
use her term, his 'bird' into her 'flower'.  Because it was done with some <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>force,
she shouted as it was painful.  She felt
something hard </span>and <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>solid and
then warm liquid getting inside her genitals.  The accused was moving his body sideways and intently looking at her as
he did so.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;At this juncture, a certain 'Cano' (Lolito Obligacion), who
was tending to a few fighting cocks nearby, shouted, ‘Goldie, your grandmother
is coming.' On hearing that, she stood up, descended the stairs of the hut, and
rushed to her <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>grandma and guardian,
Fedelina A. Tan,  Grandmother and granddaughter
then went home together.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;On reaching home, she confided to her Lola that she felt pain
in her 'flower' because Ricky Sueta inserted his 'bird' into it.  Then her aunt, Marie Lis A. Tan, a
registered nurse, and her uncle, Wilfredo Tan, a physician, took a look at her
genitals and decided to take her to the Roxas Memorial General Hospital here in
Roxas City for physical examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;At the Roxas Memorial General Hospital, Goldie Ruth Fuentes
was subjected to a pelvic examination by Dr. Ma. Lourdes Lanada, the resident
physician then on duty.  Her findings
are reflected in a medical certificate marked by the defense as Exh. '1' (p.
22, record).  It shows that the genitalia
was grossly normal, that in the labia minora there was a 1 cm. old healed laceration,
lower 3rd right, that the hymen was open and intact, and that there was no
presence of spermatozoa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;The grandmother and guardian of Goldie, Fedelina Tan,
testified that at about noon of December 30, 1989, she was tending their
grocery store along Roxas Avenue, Roxas City.  A few minutes before, she saw Goldie playing with a playmate.  At about noon, she started looking for her
granddaughter as the child had not come home as she used to before
noontime.  She sent one of their
salesgirls to look for her in the neighboring establishments.  The salesgirl having failed to find the
child, she herself went out to look for her.  She went to several stores nearby and when she entered the Family
Bakeshop a man informed her that Goldie was playing in the backyard, near the
poultry.  She hastened to the place, and
as she was approaching a small hut that man shouted, 'Goldie, your grandmother
is here.' When she called her, Goldie came down from the hut.  She saw the accused lying down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;When they reached home, Fedelina said she bathed Goldie and
changed her clothes.  It was then that
the little girl started complaining that her genitals were painful.  Asked why, the girl answered it was because
the accused inserted his sex organ into hers.  The little girl said this in a more picturesque language: 'My flower is
painful because Ricky inserted his bird inside it'.  Hearing that, she took a good look at her genitals and she saw a
small laceration and a <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>little
bleeding.  She quickly summoned her son,
Dr. Wilfredo Tan, and his wife, Marie Liz, a registered nurse, and told them to
examine the child.  The two quickly
concluded that their niece was a victim of a criminal assault.  And so the two took Goldie to the hospital
for physical examination.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;From the hospital, Dr. Tan took Goldie to the Roxas City
Police Station to lodge their complaint for rape against the accused.  Patrolman Rosendo Abo-ol and three other
policemen were then ordered by a police lieutenant to proceed to the Family
Bakeshop to pick the accused up (sic) for <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>questioning.  The policemen found the accused </span>behind
the bakeshop.  The policemen took the
accused to the police station, and on arrival, Pat. Abo-ol saw Goldie point to
the accused as the man who criminally assaulted her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;The girl's uncle, Dr. Wilfredo Tan, told the court that when
his mother Fedelina called him and his wife Marie Liz to examine the little
girl who was complaining of pain in the vagina, they made her lie down, spread
her legs and took a look at her genitals.  They saw a laceration at the right labia minora, with redness and
swelling.  Certain that his niece was
criminally assaulted, he and his wife took her to the hospital for pelvic
examination.  A few days later, he
accompanied his niece to Dr. Bisnar, and then to Dr. Jaboneta in Iloilo City
for further pelvic examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;The testimony of Dr. Tan was corroborated in all its material
points by his wife, Marie Liz A. Tan.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'

<p class=BODY>Appellant does not deny that he was with the victim and her
playmate, Thissa Marie (&quot;Temar&quot;) Hoo, at the time of the
incident.  What he vehemently disputes
is the alleged commission of the rape on the victim.  He recalled at the witness stand that in the morning of December
30, 1990, Goldie Ruth and Temar Hoo were playing children's games at the hut
where he usually rested and slept.  He
had been recently hired by his brother-in-law, Wilfredo Hoo, to take care of
the latter's fighting cocks.  Apart from
serving as his sleeping quarters, it was in that hut that he kept watch over
Wilfredo Hoo's game fowls.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6"

<p class=BODY>Appellant further claims that an assistant, Lolito
(&quot;Cano&quot;) Rodriguez, tended to the fighting cocks nearby.  As noontime approached, appellant decided to
take an early nap and he soon fell asleep.  After a while, he was roused from slumber by the noise created by the
playful girls.  It was then almost high
noon and it was at this time that Goldie Ruth's grandmother arrived to fetch
the girl.  <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>Appellant narrated that when her grandmother called out for her, Goldie
Ruth clambered out of the hut but fell on her buttocks.  The girl was aided back on her feet by her
grandmother and, together, they departed for home.  Shortly thereafter, appellant resumed his interrupted sleep.</span><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>A few hours later, appellant was awakened by his father who told
Sueta that some policemen were looking for him.  Appellant then appeared before the law enforcers and went
voluntarily with them to the Roxas City police station.  There, he was surprised to know <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>of </span>the accusation against him.  According to appellant, he was maltreated by
the policemen when he professed his innocence.  Since then, he has been under detention.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8'
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>Satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that appellant had indeed
perpetrated the dastardly deed on Goldie Ruth Fuentes, the court <i>a quo</i>
rendered its verdict of guilt on June 21, 1990, sentencing appellant to serve a
term of &quot;imprisonment for life (reclusion perpetua),&quot;<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
to indemnify the victim, her guardian and/or parents in the amount of
P25,000.00, and to pay them P7,000.00 &quot;as reimbursement for the private
prosecutor's fee.” The court also credited appellant in the service of his
sentence with the full time that he spent under preventive imprisonment.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10' href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class=BODY>In this appeal, appellant insists that the trial court committed
a grave error when it gave more credence to the testimonies of the witnesses
for the prosecution, particularly the testimony of the victim herself, Goldie
Ruth, than to the version of the defense.  He contends that the trial court failed to take into account the
&quot;story­-telling&quot; habit of the girl and the inconclusive medical
findings of the doctors who examined Goldie Ruth.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>After a thorough and careful review of the records, we have
perforce to reject appellant's contentions, fully convinced as we are of the
utter lack of merit in the theory and evidence of the defense.</p>

<p class=BODY>At the outset, it may be well to recall some doctrines that
generally guide the courts in arriving at a just verdict in prosecutions for
rape, to wit: (1) An accusation for rape can be made with facility; it <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt'>is </span>difficult to prove but more
difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to refute; (2) In view of
the intrinsic nature of the crime where two persons are usually involved, the
testimony of the complainant must be received with extreme caution; and (3) The
evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and must not
be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12' href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>As in most criminal cases, the issue here boils down to the
favorable appreciation by the trial court of the testimonies proffered by the
litigants.  In this particular case, the
trial court gave more weight and credence to the declarations of the witnesses
for the prosecution and, on that score, the settled rule is that such a finding
must be respected, given the natural advantage that a trial judge <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>has </span>in the calibration of such
evidence.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

<p class=BODY>As earlier stated, the offended party, Goldie Ruth T. Fuentes,
was only five years old at the time of the rape.  At such a tender age, she could not be expected to weave with
uncanny recollection such a complicated tale as the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>sexual </span>assault that appellant unconscionably perpetrated on
her.  She spontaneously narrated to her
grandmother, uncle <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>and </span>aunt, to
Wilfredo Hoo and his spouse, and ultimately to <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>the </span>court, her ordeal at the hands of appellant.</p>

<p class=BODY>Witness the spontaneity and clarity of her testimony on the
stand:</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, in its order of February 9, 1990 on appellant's application
for bail, the court below correctly and aptly observed: &quot;In the case at
bar, Goldie Ruth Fuentes clearly and unequivocally testified that she felt pain
when the accused forced his penis into her genitals.  And that pain was her chief complaint to the examining physician
in the hospital.  Her narration before
the court of when and how the accused did it was so clear and convincing as to
make the court believe that hers was not a contrived story, as she appeared so

Verily, courts usually lend credence to the testimonies of young girls,
especially where the established facts indubitably point to their having been
sexually assaulted.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href="#_ftn16"

<p class=BODY>Moreover, Goldie Ruth positively pointed to appellant as her
assailant not only once but twice, firstly, when appellant was brought by the
police for questioning at the Roxas City police station and, secondly, when she
was called to testify on the witness stand.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn17'
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'> </span>In both instances, Goldie Ruth definitely
and without hesitation pointed to and identified appellant as her rapist.</p>

<p class=BODY>Appellant takes issue with the failure of the trial court to
appreciate the fact that during her cross-examination, the victim disclosed
that she had earlier been sexually abused by Sueta.  The girl stated that she also reported this to her grandmother
and for which she was likewise taken to the hospital for examination.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn18' href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>However, as perceptively observed by the Solicitor General, and
with which we agree, the victim may in all probability have been molested twice
by appellant not on different dates but on the same day and occasion.  At any rate, the indubitable fact is that
all throughout her testimony, she remained as assertive and unflinching about
the abominable attack on her chastity and the identity of her attacker as she
was when she initially revealed that fact ever so innocently to her
grandmother.</p>

<p class=BODY>What further enervates the case for appellant is his failure to
present strong and credible evidence to rebut the positive testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses.  Indeed, his bare
denials of culpability and self-serving assertions that he was asleep inside
the hut at the time of the incident do not inspire the slightest consideration
in view of his clear and positive identification by the victim as the
paraphiliac predator.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn19' href="#_ftn19"
name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant has not even presented to the court any plausible reason why the
victim, her grandmother, uncle and aunt would heap upon him such a serious
accusation as the rape of Goldie Ruth.</p>

<p class=BODY>The defense of denial, when not supported by clear and convincing
evidence, deserves no weight in law.  It
cannot be given greater evidentiary weight than the testimony of credible
witnesses who testify on affirmative matters, for as between positive and
categorical testimony which bears the earmarks of truth, on one hand, and a
bare denial, on the other, the former is generally held to prevail.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn20' href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span

12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Further, in the absence of evidence to indicate that the prosecution witnesses
were moved by improper motives, the presumption is that they were not so moved
and their testimony should accordingly be entitled to full credit.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn21' href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Appellant's protestations to the effect that the trial court was
moved by considerations of bias since the victim was a hapless five-year old
girl is at best a flaccid and futile attempt to shore a tottering defense.  In the pretensions of appellant, the trial
court &quot;was evidently under emotional excitement transformed into
directional sympathy toward the version of the alleged victim largely all
because the one telling the story is young&quot;.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn22' href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'> </span>Precisely, the trial court was
impressed by the candid and forthright declaration of the victim despite her
tender years.  Indeed, while her
statement that &quot;Ricky inserted his bird inside my flower&quot; spoke eloquently,
albeit sadly, of the utter innocence and naivete of Goldie Ruth, it also
spelled out volumes of truth to her cries of rape.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is simply hard to conceive that a young girl would invent such
a sordid tale as her violation by appellant unless it was the plain truth.  Time and again, and with indisputable
applicability to this case, the Court has held that when an alleged victim of
rape says that she has been violated, she says in effect all that is necessary
to show that rape has been inflicted on her and so long as her testimony meets
the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn23' href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>Appellant makes much of the apparent conflict in the medical
findings of the doctors who conducted physical examinations on Goldie
Ruth.  Indeed, while those of Dr. Helen
Bisnar, a private practitioner, and Dr. Lourdes Lanaga, a resident physician at
the Roxas City Memorial Hospital, indicated that the victim's hymen was intact,
that of Dr. Ricardo H. Jaboneta, the NBI Medico-Legal Officer for Region VI, showed
that the girl's hymen had suffered a laceration through &quot;intra-labial
sexual intercourse with a man on or about the alleged date of commission&quot;.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn24' href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant's arguments on this point are clearly specious submissions.</p>

<p class=BODY>The well-entrenched rule is that a medical examination is not an
indispensable element in a prosecution for rape.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn25'
href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, it may be taken into consideration <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>in determining the veracity </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>of </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>the victim's claim.</span><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn26' href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt'> </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>In
the case at bar, all the aforestated medical reports submitted by the examining
physicians were one in declaring that the offended party had suffered a one
centimeter laceration in her sexual organ, thus corroborating and lending truth
to the victim's account that she had been violated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>In fact, Dr. Jaboneta, on whose objective medical findings and
testimony the court below evidently relied upon with good reason, was emphatic
in declaring before said lower court that the laceration which he found on the
victim's sexual organ was definitely caused by the insertion of a male organ
into the girl's vagina at about the time of the alleged rape.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn27' href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
In any event, it is beyond cavil that the mere penetration of the male organ
into the <i>labia majora</i> of the victim's genitalia consummates the felony.</p>

<p class=BODY>We, therefore, hold that the trial court did not commit a
reversible error in convicting appellant since the constitutional but
disputable presumption of innocence <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>in
his </span>favor has been clearly and convincingly breached by the superior
evidence of the prosecution.  In view,
however, of this court's current policy with regard to the amount of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>indemnity </span>that may be awarded in rape
cases of this nature, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>that is, </span>rape
of a woman who is below twelve years of age, the indemnification to the victim
and her family should be increased to P50,000.00.<a style='mso-footnote-id:

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, the penalty to be imposed on appellant should be <i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>reclusion perpetua</span></i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment convicting accused-appellant

AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATIONS that said accused-appellant is hereby ordered

The proper imposable penalty under the Revised Penal Code is <i>reclusion
perpetua</i>.  In People<i> vs</i>.
Baguio (196 SCRA 459 [1991]), this Court emphasized that <i>reclusion perpetua </i>is
not the same as <i>life imprisonment.  </i>See
