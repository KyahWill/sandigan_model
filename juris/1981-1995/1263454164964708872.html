				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a case of kidnapping for ransom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about nine o'clock in the evening of July
7, 1979, seven rebels or terrorists, members of the Moro National Liberation
Front, armed with high-powered firearms and using two <span class="SpellE">pumpboats</span>,
stealthily boarded the <u>MV Minerva I</u>, a fishing boat anchored at the shore­line
between <span class="SpellE">Sitios</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salamat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bojelebong</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tipo-Tipo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rebels at gunpoint took into custody Benjamin de la Rosa, the
captain of the fishing boat or launch, and two security guards, <span class="SpellE">Abdurasul</span> <span class="SpellE">Mannan</span>, 20, and Teddy
P. <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Amaikaidal</span> <span class="SpellE">Pawaki</span>), 21, who were asleep, and took them to the two <span class="SpellE">pumpboats</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
captives were brought by the rebels to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bucalao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tipo-Tipo</span> and delivered
to <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span> (Far <span class="SpellE">Sharif</span>),
the rebel zone com­mander in that place.</p>

<p class="BODY">They were detained in a hut or <span class="SpellE"><u>camarin</u></span>
for thirteen days or until the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1979</st1:date>, when a ransom of twenty thousand pesos paid
by <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Wahab</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span> was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>
who thereupon released the three kidnapped victims to <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salam</span> <span class="SpellE">Balamo</span>, one of the
nego­tiators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balamo</span>
took the captives to <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sitio</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Banah</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Tipo-Tipo</span> where they were set free.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fishing boat was operated by <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span>, an affluent businessman from <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Banah</span> who functioned as the overall commander of the
special <span class="SpellE">para</span>-military force and the Integrated Civil Home
Defense Force in that locality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had
hired <span class="SpellE">Mannan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span>,
members of the special <span class="SpellE">para</span>-military force, to guard
the fishing boat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On July 6, 1979 or one
day before the kidnapping, the two guards were ferried from <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Banah</span> to the fishing boat by <span class="SpellE">Abdurajik</span>
<span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>, 26, a resident of <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kalang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salamat</span> and an
operator of a <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span> who was employed by <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> is the nephew of <span class="SpellE">Akmad</span> <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>, 32, a fisherman
residing at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salamat</span>, a former MNLF member, who was the commander of the
Integrated Civil Home Defense Force in that island.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of July 8, 1979 (about twelve hours after the
kidnapping) both ICHDF commanders <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> conferred with
Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> V. Bermudez, the commander of C
company of the 41st Infantry <span class="SpellE">Batallion</span> stationed at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bojelebong</span> presumably about
the kidnapping (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">F).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The seven terrorists were identified as <span class="SpellE">Utoh</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yakan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Talakawa</span> <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gamal</span> <span class="SpellE">Abirin</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Saad</span> <span class="SpellE">Abirin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Muctar</span> <span class="SpellE">Eladji</span>, Aladdin Moro and <span class="SpellE">Condah</span> alias Commander Fernandez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They guarded the kidnapped victims during the
thirteen-day period of their captivity in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bucalao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1979</st1:date>,
the provincial fiscal filed against <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> and the eight rebels (including <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>)
an information for kidnapping for ransom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Only <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>
were arrested and tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">Question:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Did <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>, with his nephew <span class="SpellE">Naduwa's</span>
assistance, mastermind the kidnapping for ransom?</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution contends that <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> conspired with <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>
and the seven terrorists to perpetrate the kidnapping for ransom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> D. Fran­cisco,
34, a sergeant in the police force of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> (not <span class="SpellE">Tipo-Tipo</span> where the
crime was committed) was the architect of the case for the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was deputed by the fiscal to investigate
the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On September 1 and 3, 1979 or
more than fifty days after the incident, he secured the affidavits of <span class="SpellE">Barahim</span> <span class="SpellE">Halim</span> and the two guards,
<span class="SpellE">Mannan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span>,
linking <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>
to the kidnapping (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A to D).</p>

<p class="BODY">Note that Lieutenant Bermudez who also investigated the case and
got the verbal statements of the kidnapped victims soon after they were
released, did not implicate <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Mannan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span>
declared in their affidavits and testimonies that in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1979</st1:date> while they were riding in
<span class="SpellE">Naduwa's</span> <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span> from <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Banah</span>, the boat anchored at
<span class="SpellE">Kalang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salamat</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> landed and
went to his house near the beach.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that occasion, <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and three
rebels named <span class="SpellE">Gamal</span> <span class="SpellE">Abirin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Muctar</span> (a close relative of <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>)
and <span class="SpellE">Hadjan</span> <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span> emerged
from <span class="SpellE">Naduwa's</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the two guards pointed their rifles at the three rebels, <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> allegedly told them not to harm the three terrorists
because they were under "surrender negotiation".</p>

<p class="BODY">To show that <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> conspired with the seven rebels, the prosecution
presented as witness <span class="SpellE">Halim</span>, 36, a resident of <span class="SpellE">Banah</span> and a conductor in the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
owned by <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani's</span>
grandson.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Halim</span> declared in his affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) and testimony that in the evening of July 7, 1979
he decided to fish for squid in the waters near <span class="SpellE">Kalang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salamat</span> which is about a kilometer away from <span class="SpellE">Banah</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He rode in
his <span class="SpellE">vinta</span> and reached <span class="SpellE">Kalang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salamat</span> at about seven-thirty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He walked to <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span>
house which was made of bamboo and <span class="SpellE">nipa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He intended to secure <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span>
permission to fish in the waters of <span class="SpellE">Kalang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salamat</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On nearing the house, he noticed that there were many persons
inside it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of entering the door,
he allegedly peeped through the wall and, by some unusual coincidence, it was
at that very moment when he heard <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> directing
the seven rebels already named to board two <span class="SpellE">pumpboats</span>,
kidnap the captain on the fishing boat and <u>kill</u> the two security guards
and then proceed to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bucalao</span>
where <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span> was waiting (16 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> was present
at that conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing that directive, <span class="SpellE">Halim</span>
left the place, boarded his <span class="SpellE">vinta</span>, proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Magbe</span> and slept in his
cousin's house in that place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could
not return to <span class="SpellE">Banah</span> because it was curfew time
already.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two security guards also testified that on <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1979</st1:date> or at noontime of the day
following the kidnapping, <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> appeared at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bucalao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marong</span> gave money to <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span> who
complimented him on the success of the kidnapping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marong</span> promised to
return to bring the ransom money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
meeting between <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>
took place within the sight and hearing of the two security guards and De la
Rosa.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two guards also testified that it was <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>
who in the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1979</st1:date>
gave the ransom money to <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the captives were released and
delivered to <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Balamo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Marong</span>, 34, testified that in the
evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1979</st1:date>, he
was fishing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time, no <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span> docked at <span class="SpellE">Kalang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salamat</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said that
the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Mannan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Halim</span> were not true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that on <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1979</st1:date> he and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>
went to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Banah</span> but he
did so in the company of some teachers and children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, he went to see Captain Bermudez at <span class="SpellE">Bojelebong</span> where he learned that De la Rosa and the two
guards were kidnapped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that
he is acquainted with <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">He did not know why <span class="SpellE">Mannan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span> testified against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had a misunderstanding with <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span> regarding a fish
corral but the trouble was patched up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said that <span class="SpellE">Halim</span> was a minion (<span class="SpellE"><u>bataan</u></span>) of <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abdurahman</span> <span class="SpellE">Balintin</span>,
a fisherman, rebutted the testimony that <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> had
intervened in collecting the ransom money by declaring that the twenty thousand
pesos were given to him (<span class="SpellE">Balintin</span>) and that he,
together with <span class="SpellE">Hadjis</span> Salami, <span class="SpellE">Gapur</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Balamo</span> and two persons named <span class="SpellE">Atti</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pawaki</span> delivered that amount to <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>, and then <span class="SpellE">Balintin</span>
delivered to <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span>
the kidnapped victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>, 27, admitted that he
was hired by <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span>
on <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1979</st1:date> to take the
two security guards to the fishing boat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The next morning he brought the two guards to <span class="SpellE">Banah</span>
and in the afternoon he took them to the boat.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that on <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="7">July
 7, 1979</st1:date> he did not go to the fishing boat because he was on guard
duty in the tower near <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He denied having gone to <span class="SpellE">Bucalao</span>
with <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> to talk with <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He explained that he was implicated in the
case because he was <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> nephew.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Jainal</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Rasul</span>
rejected the alibis and denials of <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> and gave credence to the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Halim</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mannan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span> and Sergeant Francisco.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He convicted <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> of kidnapping for ransom and sentenced
them to death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No civil liability was
imposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was elevated to this
Court for review of the death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
contends that the trial court erred in relying on <span class="SpellE">Halim's</span>
testimony, in disregarding the alibis of <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>, in not taking into account the alleged suspicious
circumstances surrounding the investigation and prosecution of the case and in
not acquitting the two accused on the ground of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our study of the record<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a> convinces us that the judgment of
conviction cannot be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
following gaps, deficiencies and improbabilities in the evidence of the
prosecution engender reasonable doubt as to the guilt of <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <span class="SpellE">Halim's</span> version is that at the moment
when he allegedly peeped inside <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> humble abode
(made of <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> and woven bamboo as walls, as described
by <span class="SpellE">Halim</span> in his affidavit) he heard <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> saying: "We are going to board on two <span class="SpellE">pumpboats</span> and proceed to the <u>Minerva I</u> (<span class="SpellE">Jalani's</span> fishing boat) and get the captain of the boat and <u>kill</u>
his security guards, <span class="SpellE">Abdurasul</span> <span class="SpellE">Mannan</span>
and Teddy <span class="SpellE">Tarabasal</span> and then proceed to <span class="SpellE">Bucalao</span> because <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span> is
waiting there." (This version is different from what <span class="SpellE">Halim</span>
stated in his affidavit, Exhibit A).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That incriminatory directive was the only matter covered by <span class="SpellE">Halim's</span> testimony on direct examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He left immediately after hearing those
words.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To a seasoned trial lawyer, that
testimony instantly evokes incredulity because of its improbability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears to be a concocted story.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is just too much of a coincidence that at the precise moment
when <span class="SpellE">Halim</span> went near <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span>
house <span class="SpellE">Halim</span> chanced to eavesdrop on <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> alleged utterance regarding the kidnapping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Halim's</span> story is
not credible because it does not accord with the common experience of
mankind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marong's</span>
small house (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2) could not have accommodated s <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">e </span>v e n rebels in addition to <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span>, not to mention
<span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> wife and children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Halim's</span> approach to
<span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> house and his alleged act of peeping through
the wall could not have passed unnoticed by the persons inside the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They would have sensed his presence
immediately considering his close propinquity to them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Another circumstance
rendering <span class="SpellE">Halim's</span> version improbable is that the
kidnapping, as actually executed, was not in conformity with <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> alleged instruction to the seven terrorists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> did not go with the rebels, although it was assumed
in his directive that he and <span class="SpellE">Naduwa</span> would accompany
the terrorists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, contrary to <span class="SpellE">Marong's</span> alleged instruction, the two security guards were
not killed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The prosecution's version that <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>
recklessly threw all caution to the winds when he talked twice with <span class="SpellE">Palsarip</span> in the presence of the three kidnapped victims is
likewise not quite believable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
sensible man perpetrating a grave offense would overexpose himself as <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> did in this case, if the prosecution's version is to
be believed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marong</span>
would have known that after the three kidnapped victims had been set free they
would surely testify against him and, therefore, it would be suicidal for him
to deliver the ransom money in the presence of the three victims.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalani</span>,
the owner of the fishing boat and the <span class="SpellE">payor</span> of the
ransom money, and De la Rosa, the captain of the boat, should have testified on
the alleged participation of <span class="SpellE">Marong</span> in the
kidnapping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They did not testify.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their <span class="SpellE">nonavailability</span>
as wit­nesses was not explained by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The possibility that <span class="SpellE">Marong</span>, who as
ICHDF commander was on the government's side, confabulated with the rebels, cannot
be ruled out but the evidence that he actually did so in this case is not
convincing and trustworthy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment of conviction is set
aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two accused are acquitted on
the ground that the prosecution's evidence is insuffi­cient to prove their
guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
