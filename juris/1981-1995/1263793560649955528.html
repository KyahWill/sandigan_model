the land and entered into transactions as its owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these happened with the knowledge and
acquiescence of the supposed <span class="SpellE">donee</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Melquiades</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> Seville.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>Contrary to the petitioners' allegations in their brief, there
was no immediate transfer of title upon the execution of Exhibit 4.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to what the petitioners aver, private respondents as
legal heirs of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Seville have actual and
substantial interests in the subject of litigation thus qualifying them as real
parties-in?interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Common ownership is shown by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, any claim of ownership of the
petitioners is not based on Exhibit 4 but on the fact that they are heirs of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Seville together with the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise significant to note the respondents' assertion
that the signed affidavit is a forgery because <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
Seville was illiterate during his lifetime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He could not write his name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
executed documents by affixing his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> as shown
in the Real Estate Mortgage (Exhibit A-4), which he executed on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1968</st1:date> in favor of the
Philippine National Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The real
estate mortgage came much later or more than five years after the supposed
donation (Exhibit 4) to <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> Seville where <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Seville allegedly affixed his signature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact was not disputed by the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the petitioners' actions do not support their claim of
ownership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">During the
lifetime of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Seville, no paid the PNB
amortization out of his personal funds and out of the income on his property.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The payments were not continued by the
petitioners when <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Seville died so much so that
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">property
was </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">extrajudicially</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">foreclosed
and had to be repurchased by <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> Seville, one of
the </span>respondents, through installment arrangements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Deed of Promise to <span class="GramE">Sell</span>
appended as Annex 4 to respondents' brief).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The actions of the respondents are in consonance with their claim of
co-ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Finally, it is a
well-established rule that the factual findings of the trial court are
generally not disturbed except where there is a clear cause or a strong reason
appearing in the record to warrant a departure from such findings (<span class="SpellE">Alcaraz</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Racimo</span>, 125 SCRA 328;
People v. <span class="SpellE">Tala</span>, </span>141 SCRA 240; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcid</span>, 135 SCRA 280).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no such clear cause or strong reason in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the petition is hereby DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
AFFIRMED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
