Obdulia L. Prado charged lawyer Eliseo A. Razon (admitted to the Bar in 
1954) with gross negligence in not seasonably informing her of the lower
 court's decision.
<p>
The record shows that Obdulia Prado appealed to the Court of First 
Instance of Manila her conviction for slander by the city court of 
Manila which sentenced her to pay a fine of P50, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency.
</p><p>
For that appeal, her <em>compadre </em>engaged the services of 
respondent Razon who submitted a memorandum for her.  The trial court 
rendered a decision dated November 6, 1974, affirming the judgment of 
the city court.  The decision was received on November 8, 1974 by the 
clerk of Councilor Fernandez at Room 204, Manila City Hall, which 
respondent Razon was occupying as his office, and delivered to him on 
November 14, 1974 or six days later.
</p><p>
Respondent Razon had until November 23, 1974 within which to file a 
motion for reconsideration or to appeal.  However, that reglementary 
period elapsed without any action by the respondent.  It was only on 
November 25, or two days later, when Prado received a copy of the 
decision by mail sent by lawyer Razon.
</p><p>
Obdulia L. Prado filed the instant administrative case for disbarment.  
In his answer, respondent Razon claims that Prado took from him all the 
papers of the case and never came back to inquire about the status of 
her appeal.  Prado denied this allegation.
</p><p>
When respondent receive a copy of the decision, he waited for Prado to 
come but she never did.  He then went to the Court of First Instance to 
ascertain her address.  Thereafter, he mailed the decision to her.
</p><p>
The credibility of respondent's explanation is destroyed by his 
admission that he had really committed a mistake in handling his 
client's case because he was beset with his own problem regarding the 
ejectment suit filed against him by the owner of the house at 297 Shaw 
Boulevard, Mandaluyong, which he was renting.  His mind was then 
occupied with locating a place where he could transfer.  He begged the 
indulgence of this Court.
</p><p>
After due investigation, the Solicitor General recommended respondent's 
suspension for not less than two months because his negligence 
prejudiced his client.
</p><p>
It is obvious that the attorney-client relationship between Prado and 
respondent arose merely out of accommodation through a mutual friend.  
There was no formal professional agreement between counsel and client.  
That fact notwithstanding, respondent cannot justifiably claim that when
 Prado got the papers from him, his serÂ­vices were being dispensed with.
  If that was his surmise, he should have formally withdrawn from the 
case with Prado's consent.  Since he did not withdraw, he was not 
relieved of the obligation of apprising Prado immediately of the 
decision.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, respondent is censured for his negligence.  A copy of this 
decision should be attached to his personal record in the Bar 
Confidant's Office.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, Escolin,</em> and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, J., (Chairman),</em> on official leave.
