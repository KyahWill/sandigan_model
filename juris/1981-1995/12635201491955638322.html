				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, finding <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Torres
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape committed against his
11-year old daughter <span class="SpellE">Elria</span> Torres, and sentencing him
to suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, to
indemnify the victim in the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and
to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant assails the credibility of his wife, Gloria
Castro-Torres and his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Elria</span> Torres, whose
testimonies he would charac­terize as "extremely improbable".</p>

<p class="BODY">The composite testimonies of Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Elria</span>
established the following facts: At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1975</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Elria</span> was suddenly awakened when she noticed that
someone was on top of her. It was her father who was naked from the waist down.
When her father in­serted his penis into her private part, she felt intense
pain. She asked him, "Father, what are you doing to me?"</p>

<p class="BODY">At that moment, Gloria, who was sleeping nearby, was likewise
awakened. She saw the appellant on top of <span class="SpellE">Elria</span> whose
panty was down to her knees. Gloria immediately kicked the appellant, <span class="GramE">then</span> asked "Why did you do this to our child?" To
this query, appellant remained silent. The girl, crying aloud, stood up, and
was embraced by her mother. Whereupon she told her mother that appellant had
placed <span class="GramE">himself</span> on top of her and raped her. When the
appellant put off the lamp, Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Elria</span> ran to
the house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Castro, Gloria's <span class="GramE">father,</span> located about 15 meters away, to seek his help. Upon
being informed of the crime committed against his grandchild, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> went to the appellant's house, but the latter was
no longer there.</p>

<p class="BODY">That same morning, mother and daughter reported the crime to the
police authorities of <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> and executed their
respective sworn statements.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Elria</span> was brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">she was physically examined by
Dr. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span>. The doctor's findings are set
forth in the medical certificate he issued:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The doctor testified that the contusion at the vaginal orifice
could have been caused by a blunt object or instrument such as the "penis
of a man."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">On the following day, <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="6">June
 26, 1975</st1:date>, Gloria Castro filed a criminal complaint against her hus­band
in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>; and on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1975</st1:date>, Assistant Fiscal
Juan <span class="SpellE">Sicam</span>, after conducting a preliminary
investigation, filed the corresponding information for rape.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Torres, father of the
appellant, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">took </span>the stand to
corroborate his son's assertion that nothing untoward happened in the night in
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the only issue raised herein hinges on the credibility of
witnesses, <span class="GramE">We</span> advert to the settled rule that the
factual findings of the trial court are entitled to great weight and res­pect,
in view of its opportunity to observe the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">demeanor
of the witnesses on the stand. In the case at bar, the trial court found the
testimonies of the victim and her mother to be reliable, sincere and
straightforward. We have carefully scrutinized the records, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">We</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"> find </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">no </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">cogent reason to disturb the said findings.
Neither had the trial court overlooked any circumstance of weight and
importance that could have materially affected the conclusion reached.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Indeed, it </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">extremely difficult to believe </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>the offended party, who was still
in the awkward age of puberty, would perjure herself by imputing to her own
father the commission of a crime against her honor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denied having abused his daughter. He claimed that his
wife had despised him for being "a poor provider," an "<span class="SpellE">estambay</span>," and a "drunkard", and that
because of her desire to separate from him, she had instigated this rape charge
for the purpose of getting rid of him. The trial judge correctly brushed aside
"this claim as a product of the appel­lant's imagination x <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>not buttressed
by actual facts."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus ?</p>

<blockquote>"The accused claims that this rape charge against him has been
motivated by the fact that Gloria, his wife, wanted to separate from him, that
they were always <span class="SpellE">quarelling</span>, citing two instances,
sometime after the first child was born and the second time in 1972. But upon
questioning by Fiscal Fer­nandez, the accused declared that from 1972 up to the
time this incident happened, he and Gloria were living peacefully; that they
had no more quarrels. At any rate, this alleged motive mentioned by the accused
is only a product of his fertile imagi­nation and is not buttressed by actual
facts. Consequently, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Court cannot
give any credence at all."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And even assuming that Gloria Castro had wanted to discontinue
her marital life with <span class="GramE">appel­lant</span>, this alleged motive
was not sufficient to impel her to fabricate a rape charge against her own
husband, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">knowing </span>fully well that
it would cer­tainly bring ignominy, humiliation and dishonor to her daughter.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the lower court that <span class="SpellE">Elria</span>
Castro was the victim of a "condemnable, beastly act" perpetrated by
her own father.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs against appellant.</p>
