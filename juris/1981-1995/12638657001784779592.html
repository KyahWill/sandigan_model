<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The facts of the case
were summarized by the trial court in the following manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution's evidence was supplied by Dr. Jaime Co, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span> and the
private offended party, Milagros <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that Milagros is 15 years
old, virgin, born on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Milagros was taken as a ward and household help by her
aunt, Hilda <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>, sister of her father, who was to
finance her high school studies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
almost three years, Milagros was living with Hilda in Hilda's house in <span class="SpellE">Burabod</span>, Bacon, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sorsogon</span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tumalad</span>,
was the common-law husband of Hilda, also living with his common-law wife
almost ten (10) months before the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the fateful day of <st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="9">September
 2, 1980</st1:date>, Mila<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">g</span>ros
arrived home from school for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
aunt Hilda was at her place of work in <span class="SpellE">Botica</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, next town from Bacon, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hilda's routine was to leave for work in the
morning and return home in the evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused <span class="GramE">who</span> was recently jobless remained
in the house tending their small store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Around <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>, a very rainy day, Milagros and the
accused took lunch together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
the only two persons in the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
lunch and (when Milagros was) about to wash the dishes, the accused who was now
inside the bedroom called for Milagros<span class="GramE">,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Milagros</span>, come here’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The time was around <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30 p.m.</st1:time> and raining heavily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sensing no evil motive for the call, Milagros
entered the bedroom and asked, ‘What is it, <span class="SpellE">Tio</span>?<span class="GramE">’.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
grabbed <span class="SpellE">Milagros's</span> hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She struggled, got free and moved towards the
door but the accused caught her hand again, pulled her inside and pushed her to
the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She hit her knee on the <span class="GramE">bed,</span> fell flat on the bed faced down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused locked the door and approached
Milagros who was lying on the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused started embracing and kissing Milagros and telling the latter not to
make any noise, ‘if you still want to live’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused was in shorts and shirtless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At this point Milagros was now flat on the bed, face up and the accused
lying on top, holding Milagros on both hands with his left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The knee of the accused was placed between
the thighs of the girl with his free right hand, unzipped his pants releasing
his penis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">When the
accused pulled down Milagros’ panty the latter shouted '<span class="SpellE">Tia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mameng</span>', another aunt, Carmen, who lives across the
street.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To stop the cry the
accused covered the mouth of Milagros with his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Milagros was biting the rapist but the latter
pulled her hair tilting her head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Milagros kept on struggling and moving her body to prevent being
raped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All her efforts were of no avail
as <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> penis penetrated her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Milagros felt pain upon penetration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was blood in the vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the accused stood up<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>Milagros noticed a whitish fluid on
her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then someone appeared at the
store to buy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Milagros got her panty,
walked towards the store which was inside the house and proceeded out the house
to the house of her <span class="SpellE">Tia</span> <span class="SpellE">Mameng</span>
across the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the house of her
<span class="SpellE">Tia</span> <span class="SpellE">Mameng</span>, Milagros
proceeded one kilometer to her father's house and reported to her father her
harrowing experience of being raped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
aunt, <span class="SpellE">Tia</span> <span class="SpellE">Mameng</span>, followed
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Receiving his daughter's news, the
father went to the house of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Milagros, with her Aunt Carmen, proceeded to the house of her
grandfather and again reported her harrowing experience to her grandfather.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Testifying, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>, the father of the victim declared, that he signed

accused about his daughter's report, the accused pushed him out of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He left <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned all come down to the argument that the
prosecution had failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the assigned errors
will be discussed together in the paragraphs which follow.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal defense presented by the accused was basically that
he did not rape the complainant Milagros <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>,
because he had no need to rape her, that indeed complainant had led the accused
into sexual play and <span class="SpellE">onanism</span> but not
intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, more
specifically, first pointed to the circumstance that no signs of physical
injury were found on her body upon physical examination of Milagros <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Milagros
was examined by Dr. Jaime Co on the afternoon of the very day that the rape
occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="GramE">finding
were</span> summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"According to Dr. Jaime Co, on <st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1980</st1:date> around <st1:time minute="25" hour="15">3:25
 p.m.</st1:time>, he examined Milagros <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His external findings:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No external sign of physical injury; very
scanty pubic hair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Internal
findings:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Vagina admits one (1) finger
with slight difficulty; hymen with fresh laceration at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time>; smear for spermatozoa - positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He issued a medical certificate of his
findings (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '<span class="GramE">A</span>').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his opinion there was penetration of the
penis into the vagina because of presence of sperm cells, deep inside the
vaginal canal."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that, despite her testimony that she had fought
and resisted vigorously the sexual assault upon her by the accused, there were
no signs of physical injury on her body, does not negate the commission of
rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Force, as an element of the crime of rape, need not be irresistible force; all
that is required is that force was successfully used.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Sarile</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court explained:</p>

<blockquote>“Nor is the credibility that attaches to complainant's narration
weakened by the assertion of the inadequacy of the force exerted on her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In another early decision, United States v. <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span> (4 Phil. 434), promulgated in 1905, this Court,
through Justice Torres, held:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘It is a
doctrine well established by the courts that in order to consider the existence
of the crime of rape <u>it is not necessary that the force employed in accom­plishing
it be so great or of such character as could not be resisted; it is only
necessary that the force used by the guilty party be sufficient to consummate
the purpose which he had in view</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Judgment May 4, 1878, Supreme Court of Spain.)’.</span> There is
this similar ruling in People v. <span class="SpellE">Momo</span> (56 Phil.86
[1931]): <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>‘<u>It need not be
irresistible; ‘it need but be present, and so long as it brings about the
desired result, all consideration of whether it was more or less irresistible
is beside the point</u>.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense then presented a long story the point of which was
that Milagros, far from having been raped by the accused, had been in love with
him and had seduced him on that noon of 2 September 1980 and had left the house
crying because the accused had advised her to leave the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This involved story was summed up in the
trial court's decision in these terms:</p>

<blockquote>"On the side of the defense Julio <span class="SpellE">Deoneda</span>,
Hilda <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>, Milagros <span class="SpellE">Dioquino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Morato</span> and the accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tumalad</span>,
testified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> several months before the
alleged incident the accused had observed that the offended party was falling
in love with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In spite of her
classes in school the offended party comes home any time in the morning and afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the offended party arrives home, she
sits beside him and embraces him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes she takes a bath and wears seductive dress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused had to remind the offended party
to refrain from these acts as she was already grown up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused informed his common-law wife about
the behavior of her ward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At first Hilda
refused to believe his story so the accused instructed Hilda not to go to work
and observe her ward's behavior.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Around <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, while Hilda was
bathing, they observed Milagros approaching their house but sensing that Hilda
was in the house, refrained from entering and went back to school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Convinced that Milagros was infatuated with
the accused, Hilda told her father, Julio <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>, to
take Milagros as boarder or allow her to eat lunch with him to avoid any
compromising situation with the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Milagros, as instructed, stayed with her grand­father <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>a week, thereafter, returned to
the house of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon Milagros’
return Hilda told Milagros that she (Hilda) will stop spending for her
(Milagros) schooling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1980</st1:date> around <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 p.m.</st1:time>, while the accused was resting in bed
Milagros entered the bedroom, sat on the bed and told the accused of her
problem, that her aunt would stop supporting her studies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused answered that he was in no
position to help her as he was jobless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hearing the answer Milagros cried and moved closer towards the accused
until her breast was touching his body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reacting, he embraced Milagros.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They found themselves lying together, embracing, kissing and romancing
each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused raised her skirt
and pulled down her panty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
fingering the girl's organ while the offended party was also holding his organ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still lying side by side, and fingering the
girl's organ, the accused masturbated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In masturbating the turgid male organ was touching the vagina until the
moment of ejaculation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the
involuntary moment of ejaculation the penis was touching the lips of the vagina
and the sperm covered the vagina and the girl's abdomen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the accused categorical­ly denied
that his penis penetrated the vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the torrid romance the accused said, 'You see what happened to
us'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told her that she better leave
the house because what happened will always happen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rebuked Milagros cried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then someone appeared at the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused stood up and attended to the
customer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He saw Milagros crying and
walking out of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later the
father of Mila<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">g</span>ros arrived and
confronted the accused what he did to his daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the accused denied doing wrong,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>the father left their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grandfather, the common-law wife of the
accused, the aunt and the schoolteacher of the victim corroborated the defense
version of the incident.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The story woven by the accused with all the artfulness and
imagination of a cheap paperback did not persuade the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the one hand, Francisco's story appeared
contrived and implausible to the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, the trial court found the testimony of complainant
Milagros <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span> to be straightforward, "firm
and categorical" and obviously worthy of credence:</p>

<blockquote>"In rape cases, the offended party's testimony must be subject
to a thorough scrutiny.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is
that crimes against chastity by their very nature usually involve only two
persons, the complainant and the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court examined with greatest care the complainant's story and
subjected it to a thorough scrutiny to determine its veracity in the light of
human nature and experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
does not find any flaw in the testimony of the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony, so firm and categorical, does
not give rise to any doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She narrated

that?</blockquote>

took a bath, after I took a bath it was already time to go to School, how could

already time for me to go to school</u>.</blockquote>

also the accused testified to the effect that you were asked to leave his house

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In the effort to
strengthen the story of the accused, the defense presented Hilda <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>, the common-law wife of the accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tumalad</span> and aunt of the complainant Milagros <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hilda
testified that the accused had told her that Milagros was infatuated with him,
that Milagros would sometimes come home unexpectedly, complaining of a
headache; that according to Francisco, when Milagros would come home during
school hours, she would "cream up", take a bath </span>and
"spray <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">perfume" and put on
"sheer dresses".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony
of Hilda <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span> cannot, however, be given
substantial weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place,
that testimony was basically hearsay in character, expressly based upon what
the accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tumalad</span> had conveyed to
Hilda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the </span>second place, Hilda
had expressly admitted that Francisco was her common-law companion and that she
had hated her niece Milagros.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She thus
had a powerful motive to try and exculpate Francisco at the expense of her
15-year old niece.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also presented Julio <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>,
grandfather of Milagros and father of Hilda <span class="SpellE">Dioneda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
sometime in the first week of August, 1980, do you remember whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">you </span>have an occasion when you talk with

1980?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
was the reason?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Hilda, "Father, you
include Milagros in the preparation of the food for lunch because I told her
that she should take her lunch here at your house."</blockquote>

she tell you the reason why she wanted Milagros to take her lunch with you</u>?
</blockquote>

Francisco is alone at home and Milagros is also alone with Francisco</u>.</blockquote>

did not go to my house.</blockquote>

did you have occasion to see Milagros the following day?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">We note that Julio <span class="SpellE">Dioneda's</span>
testimony does not in any way corroborate the story of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tumalad</span> that Milagros was in love with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the testimony of Julio could very
well be understood <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>meaning
simply that Francisco should not be given an opportunity to take advantage of
the 15-year old Milagros, and that, according to Milagros, she was a grown-up
and hence not afraid of Francisco.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> complex story included
the contention that there had been no sexual intercourse at all between him and
Milagros that early afternoon of <st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="9">2
 September 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his
Brief, the accused argued that if he, Francisco, had indeed forced himself upon
Milagros, the latter would have suffered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">multiple
lacerations in her genitalia.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
boasting is at once perplexing and thoroughly unpersuasive here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The medical examination of Milagros had shown
the presence of a fresh laceration in </span>her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">hymen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was certainly more
than sufficient to show that penetration of the vagina had occurred, and that
the crime of rape was consummated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jurisprudence tells us in fact that laceration of the hymen is not
necessary to prove the consummation of the crime of rape;</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

there was any laceration of the hymen or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is also settled doctrine that full penetration of the vagina is not
constitutive of rape, and that the slightest penetration -- without the hymen
being reached and lacerated at all -- is sufficient to consummate the crime.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The appellant sought to
make much of supposed inconsist­encies in the testimony of Milagros, i.e.,
whether the accused had kissed and fondled her before or after the sexual
intercourse; whether the accused had pulled down her undergarment with his left
or with his right hand; and when precisely did she discover that she was
bleeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court considers that such
inconsistencies -- if inconsistencies </span>they were -- are too insubstantial
and trivial to adversely affect the credibility of Milagros’ testimony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The accused challenged as crude and unreliable the procedure used
by Dr. Jaime Co in conducting the medical examination of Milagros.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This challenge has no merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Solicitor General's
response to it:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant is not a medical expert, as to validly question the
medical procedure applied by Dr. Co in conducting the medical examination of
private complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If indeed he was doubtful of the reliability and veracity of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Co's</span> adopted procedure and finding, appellant should have
presented another medical expert to refute the same and cause the striking out
of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Co's</span> testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, his gratuitous and layman's
observation and conclusions cannot prevail over Dr. <span class="SpellE">Co's</span>
expert medical opinions on the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>More so, since there is no showing that Dr. Co deviated from the normal
medical procedure or otherwise falsified the results of the medical examination
conducted on private complainant."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
