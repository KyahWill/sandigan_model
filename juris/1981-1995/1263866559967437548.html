<p class="BODY">Whether or not compliance with this requirement is mandatory in
every instance, and is indeed so essential as to cause the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
to lose jurisdiction over a specific criminal case in the event of its non-<span class="SpellE">fulfilment</span>, is the main issue presented by the special
civil action of <i>certiorari</i><span style=""> </span>at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue is raised in the context
of the undisputed facts hereunder narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) employees of the Central Bank -- Manuel Valentino and
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Estacio</span> -- and nine (9) private individuals,
were charged with several felonies of <span class="SpellE"><i style="">estafa</i></span><i style=""> thru
falsification of public documents</i><span style=""> </span>in
three<span style=""> </span>(3) separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The actions were docketed as Criminal Cases Numbered 5949 to 5951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were assigned to the Second Division of
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the prosecution rested its case, the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
filed with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> on August 23, 1984,
another set of three (3) indictments, this time against <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> (Assistant Manager of the <span class="SpellE">Greenhills</span> Branch of CITIBANK) and Rogelio Vicente, also a
private individual, charging them with the same crimes involved in Cases No.
5949 to 5951 <span style="">as </span><i style="">principals by <span style="">indispensable cooperation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></i>The
actions against <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> and Vicente were docketed as
Criminal Cases Numbered 9349 to 9351.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were assigned to the Third Division of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> moved to quash the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> on January 3, 1985 on the basic theory that as
a private individual charged as co-principal with government employees, he
should be tried jointly with the latter pursuant to Section 4 (paragraph 3) of
PD 1606, as amended, <i style=""><span style="">supra;</span></i><span style=""> </span>hence, the separate proceedings
commenced against him were invalid, for lack of jurisdiction of the<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
over the offenses and his person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Third Division denied <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span>
motion to quash, by Resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="2">February
 22,1985</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It ruled that (a) the joint trial of private individuals and public employees
charged as co-principals, dealt with in the cited provision of law, is not a
jurisdictional requirement; (b) <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span> theory would
practically make the Court's "jurisdiction over a private individual
charged as co-principal, accomplice or accessory with a public officer or
employee dependent upon such private individual" (as by evading service of
legal processes until "joint trial is no longer feasible"); and (c)
it is the intention of the <span style="">law, </span>manifested
in the same Section 4, "to avert split jurisdiction (and) thus avoid
multiplicity of suits."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> moved for reconsideration on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion was denied by Resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in order to obviate his objection to
a separate trial, which was the principal basis of his motion to quash, the
Third Division, in the same resolution, referred <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span>
cases (No. 9349 to 9351) to the Second Division for consolidation with Cases
Numbered 5949 to 5951.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But by that time the trial of Criminal Cases No. 5949 to 5951 had
been terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">S</span>econd Division thus resolved, on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1985</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
to deny the proposed consolidation of the action and <span style="">to </span>return Criminal Cases No. 9349 to 9351 to the Third
Division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its Resolution, the Second
Division also made the following observation, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"In Our resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1985</st1:date>, We accepted the transfer of these cases and
directed the accused and counsel to ascertain the advisability of having them
consolidated and jointly tried with Criminal Cases Nos. 5949 to 5951 which have
been previously ordered reopened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, at the hearing held on April 1, 1985, counsel for accused
Rogelio G. Vicente <span style="">manifested </span>that there is no possibility of the instant cases
being consolidated with Criminal Cases Nos. 5949 to 5951 or the adoption of
prosecution's evidence adduced in said cases, as well as the fact that said
accused has a pending motion for reinvestigation with the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tanodbayan</i></span>
* * *.’”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On receiving the criminal cases back from the Second Division,
the Third Division set the cases for arraignment and trial on August 1 and 2,
1985.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="6"><span style="">June 26,
 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> filed with this Court the petition for </span><i>certiorari</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">and prohibition at bar.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He argues that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> acted
with grave abuse of discretion in seeking to try him separately from the
Central Bank employees:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
accordance with the clear phraseology of paragraph 3, Section 4, PD 1606, it is
required that he shall be tried jointly with the government employees involved
in the same offenses, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manuel
Valentino and Jesus <span class="SpellE">Estacio</span>; the language is
mandatory, the requirement jurisdictional.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being
mandatory and jurisdictional, the provision should be given a strict
construction, citing American authorities<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="color: black; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that if mandatory provisions prescribed by law are not followed,
the proceedings to which they relate are illegal and void.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is a special court, with
jurisdiction over special cases which are removed from the jurisdiction of
regular courts; and since the governing law allows only one appeal from its
judgments of conviction and therefore the defendant's chances of eventual
acquittal is thereby lessened, the law creating said <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
should be subject to strict interpretation because in derogation of general
jurisdiction and of rights of individuals.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="color: black; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sum, before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
may lawfully try a </span>private individual under PD 606, the following
requisites must be satisfied:<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he must be charged with a public officer/employee,
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he
must be tried jointly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Otherwise, ordinary courts should have jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other interpretation would render the
provision in question "useless, <span style="">meaningless
and nugatory."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Third Division itself recognized the need for a joint trial when it referred
his cases to the Second Division for consolidation.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
a joint trial was then already impossible, said mandatory and jurisdictional
provision can no longer be complied with; therefore, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
cannot exercise jurisdiction over the offense and the person of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
these circumstances, the petitioner has a right to be tried by civil courts
where his chances of acquittal are greater considering that <span style="">therein, there are at least two levels of
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution should have amended the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in
Criminal Cases No. 5949 to 5951 to include <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> as
additional accused (this being only an amendment in form); then it could ask
for suspension of the proceedings, so the evidence can be re-introduced as
against <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
the only public employee charged in Criminal Cases 5949-5951 is
janitor-messenger, <span class="SpellE">Estacio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other Central Bank employee, Valentino,
had already been discharged as a state witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He (<span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>) was being made to stand trial in
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> simply because an "errand
boy" in the Central Bank has also been accused of some complicity in the
crime.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, for his part -</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style=""> </span>brands as absurd the
petitioner's argument that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> may
acquire jurisdiction only by a joint trial, this being contrary to the rule
that in criminal cases jurisdiction of the person is acquired by his arrest (or
voluntary submission to the Court), and over the offense, by the filing of the
indictment; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style=""> </span>asserts that Section 4
(3), PD 1606 merely prescribes the procedure when a private individual is
charged with a public officer or employee; once jurisdiction is acquired, it is
not lost by procedural error (Ramos, et al. v. CB, 41 SCRA 565; <span class="SpellE">Dioquino</span> v. Cruz, et al.,116 SCRA 451).</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1606 vests the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> with exclusive original jurisdiction over specific
crimes and, as the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> has pointed out, <i style="">supra</i><span style="">, </span>provides against split jurisdiction as regards the civil
liability arising from the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
declares that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> shall <span style="">have -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" ** Exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Violations
of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, <span style="">ot</span>herwise
known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act <span style="">No. </span>1379, and Chapter II, Section 2,
Title VII of the Revised Penal Code;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It also declares that -</p>

<blockquote>"Any provision of law or the Rules of Court to the contrary
notwithstanding, the criminal action and the corresponding civil action for the
recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall at all times
be simultaneously instituted <span style="">with, </span>and jointly <span class="SpellE">determlined</span> <span style="">in </span>the same proceeding by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> or the appropriate courts (also vested with
jurisdiction over crimes committed by public officers and employees), the filing
of the criminal action being deemed to necessarily carry with it the filing of
the civil action, and no right to reserve the filing of such civil action
separately from the criminal action shall be recognized; Provided, However,
That where the civil action had heretofore been filed separately but judgment
therein has not yet been rendered, and the criminal case is hereafter filed
with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> or the appropriate court, said
civil action shall be transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
or the appropriate court, as the <span style="">case </span>may be, for consolidation and joint
determination with the criminal action, otherwise the separate civil action
shall be considered abandoned.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now, the crime with <span style="">which </span><span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> is charged -- <i>as co-</i><i style="">principal</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">by</i><span style="">

exclusive original jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is indisputable that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
acquired jurisdiction of the offenses charged in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> and his co-accused, based on the
nature of the crimes as described in the indictments and the penalty prescribed
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also incontrovertible is that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
acquired jurisdiction of the persons of the accused through their arrest by
virtue of a warrant, or voluntary submission to the Court's authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the law requires that <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>
and Vicente, as private individuals charged as co-principals with public
officers or employees, "be tried jointly with said public officers or
employees." Given the peculiar circumstances of their cases, i.e., they (<span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> and Vicente) were not investigated and indicted
until long after the criminal proceedings against their co-principals had
commenced, and the latter's cases had already been submitted for decision when <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span> and Vicente's own cases came up for trial -- the
question that now arises is whether or not the declaration of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> that it was no longer possible or legally
feasible to try them jointly with the government employees accused of the same
offenses, had the effect of causing the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
to lose jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span> cases, and whether
or not, as a consequence, those cases became cognizable by the regular courts
and should be transferred thereto for trial and <span class="SpellE">adjudgment</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must at once be evident that the seeming impossibility of a
joint trial cannot and does not alter the essential nature <span style="">of </span>the
crimes in question, as felonies perpetrated by public officers or employees in
confabulation with private persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be as obvious, too, that assuming it is correct to construe the law in a
strictly literal sense, the indicated course of action would be to insist on
holding a joint trial regardless of whatever circumstances may appear to make
such a joint trial inappropriate, inconvenient, unfeasible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for instance, the cases in the Second
Division, although already submitted for decision, should be reopened to allow
for the consolidation of <span class="SpellE">Bondoc’s</span> cases with those of
the defendants therein, and the reception of evidence against and for <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, even
in the extreme hypothesis of appeal having already been taken by <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span> co-accused, the course of action dictated by a
literal construction of the provision on joint trial is the remand of the
appealed case to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> so that the joint
trial may be conducted.</p>

<p class="BODY">To construe the law in the manner indicated, however, would <span style="">be </span>unreasonable, if not absurd (what
of the <span style="">case, for instance, where the </span>accused
public officers or employees have already been convicted and have appealed, or
are already serving sentence, or have been acquitted), and settled is the <span style="">rule </span>that courts should not give a
statute a meaning that would lead to absurdities;<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
general terms of a statute should be so limited in their application as
precisely to avoid absurdities, and it will always be presumed that the
legislature intended exceptions to its language which <span style="">would avoid consequences </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">this
character.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The provision in question </span>should thus
be read as requiring that <span style="">private
individuals accused in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, together
with public </span>officers or employees, must be tried jointly with the latter
unless the attendant circumstances have made impossible or impracticable such a
joint trial, as in the cases at bar, in which event the trial of said private
persons may proceed separately from the public officers or employees whose own
trials have been concluded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, there is nothing so sacrosanct or important about a
joint trial as to justify a radical deviation from ordinary, orderly court
processes in order to have it, or as <span style="">to </span>affect
the very jurisdiction of the Court required to conduct it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the State or of the accused
does not become weaker or stronger whether presented at a joint or separate
trial; the rights of the accused are not enhanced or diluted by the character
of a trial <span style="">as joint </span>or separate;
the procedure prescribed <span style="">in </span>either
situation is essentially the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is a gauge of the importance of a joint trial, in the eyes of
trial <span style="">attorneys </span>and of the law
itself, that there are as many lawyers moving for a separate trial as there are
for a joint trial, and that courts are granted the discretion, in <span style="">case wh</span>ere two or more accused are
jointly charged with an offense, to order separate trials instead of a joint
trial, on motion of the fiscal or any accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is not legally possible to transfer <span class="SpellE">Bondoc’s</span> cases to the Regional Trial Court, for the simple
reason that the latter would not have jurisdiction over the offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already above intimated, the inability of
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> to hold a joint trial of <span class="SpellE">Bondoc’s</span> cases and those of the government employees
separately charged for the same crimes, has not altered the nature of the
offenses charged, as <span class="SpellE"><i>estafa</i></span> thru falsification
punishable by penalties higher than <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i>correccional</i></span> or imprisonment of six years, or a fine
of P6,000.00, committed by government employee in conspiracy with private
persons, including <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>. These crimes are within
the exclusive, original jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They simply cannot be taken cognizance of by
the regular courts, apart from the fact that even if the cases could be so
transferred, a joint trial would nonetheless not be possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span> <span style="">only </span>other argument, that his cases should be transferred to the
regular courts because he would there have two levels of appeal (i.e.. the
Court of Appeals, and then the Supreme Court), <span style="">unlike in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> where </span>his
appellate recourse is only one, to the Supreme Court, it suffices to point out,
as the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> has, that the matter has long
