<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P</span>eople's
evidence was summed up by the Trial Court as follows:</p>

morning of <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1979</st1:date>,
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> fetched <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
Gonzales, his brother-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
bound for <span class="SpellE">Loob</span>, <span class="SpellE">Uyong</span>, <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> to buy '<span class="SpellE">boho</span>'<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>On
their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">way, </span><span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
Gonzales stopped to answer a call of nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> walked ahead, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> suddenly appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>, then and there, hacked away
at Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> with a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits 'B' and 'B-1').</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Nemesia</span> Gonzales got scared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He ran to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain, Buenaventura Arenas of <span class="SpellE">Uyong</span>, <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
told the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain about the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, Martha, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen's</span>
wife, arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She revealed that
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> and her husband, Domingo, were
fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Buenaventura
Arenas and <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> Gonzales returned to the place of
the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They came upon Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> in a yard soaked in blood and lifeless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About thirty (30) to forty (40) meters away
was Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen's</span> house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Buenaventura Arenas returned home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He proceeded to report the matter to the police authorities at <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> Gonzales, on the other hand, proceeded to inform
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> wife of the incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Responding to Buenaventura Arenas' report, Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Camalao</span>, Castillo and <span class="SpellE">Isora</span> of
the <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> INP
were ordered to conduct a spot investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the scene of the crime, the investigators saw Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> lying dead in a yard (Exhibit 'A-4') some thirty
(30) to forty (40) meters away from Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen's</span>
house (Exhibit 'A-2').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Camalao</span> prepared a sketch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibits 'A' and 'A-1<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">'</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were bloodstains (Exhibits 'A-3',
'A-5', 'A-6', 'A-7') within the perimeter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were also shreds of the skull.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibit 'A-8').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, an
inspection on Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen's</span> house revealed the
presence of bloodstains on the flooring.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Further inquiries indicated that Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>
went to <span class="SpellE">Loob</span>, <span class="SpellE">Uyong</span>, <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So, the police authorities went over to the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here, they came upon Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> hiding in a '<span class="SpellE">boho</span>'
groove.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Identifying themselves, the
police ordered Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> to surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>
came out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He threw his bolo to the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits 'B' and 'B-1').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> was
asked about Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>
readily admitted causing the victim's death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> was brought to town.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was treated of his wounds on his hand and
knee by the Municipal Health Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> was lodged in
jail."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused admitted
authorship of the crime but claimed that he killed Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>
in defense of himself and of his wife's honor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His version of the event was summarized by the Trial Court in this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the evidence for the accused tends to show
that at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="12">12:30 to 1:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the early morning of <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="12">December 2,
 1979</st1:date>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> came home from the
mountain at <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span>, <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
carried a sack full of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he approached his house, he heard his wife
crying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, he silently went up the
ladder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then and there, he saw Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> atop his (<span class="SpellE">Banasen's</span>)
wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>
confronted Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>
immediately put on his pants and stood up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> drew a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He held Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen's</span>
hair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneously, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> on the left palm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was followed by blows hitting Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>
on the left hand and knee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> moved back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also drew his bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He hacked away at Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> first hitting his right wrist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span>
bolo fell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>
ran downstairs, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> gave chase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once at the ground, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> held Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> by
the left arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> extricated himself from Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> hold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
was a struggle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The protagonists sought
to evade each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But then, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> persisted at pursuing Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>
<span class="SpellE">boloed</span> Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> at
the left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> followed through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> was hit in the forehead and
the head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>
ran.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mockingly, he reminded Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> of the earlier incident with Martha <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span> got enraged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He could no longer control himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So, he hacked away at Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By then, the <span class="SpellE">protogonists</span>
were already on the road.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> fell dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>
came to his senses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, he dragged
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> to a nearby yard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By now, the thought for repentance overcame
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He pondered on his options on whether to go to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> or to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Loob</span>, <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
where he had his relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He decided
on going to his relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He intended
to seek his relatives' assistance at surrendering at <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His plans did not go through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He gave himself up to the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also handed over his bolo.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Pat. <span class="SpellE">Diomedes</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Camalao</span>
showing additional blood stains in surrounding areas (Exhibits "A-3",
"A-5", and "A-6").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those blood stains confirm the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
version that the fight between the accused and the victim started inside the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the house, down the stairs with the accused chasing
the victim, with the fight continuing by the kitchen, and up to the barbed wire
fence on the southern shoulder of the road where the victim was fatally hacked
as shown by the pieces of skull and brain tissue and blood stains scattered
thereat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From that point, the accused
realizing the gravity of what he had done, dragged the victim to the adjoining

found (Exhibit "A-4").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
version that the victim's hat flew off when he <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
the victim on the latter's forehead is likewise confirmed by Exhibit
"A-7" showing the hat on the ground near the kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>That there was such a struggle on the
ground outside the kitchen was also corroborated by defense witness, <span class="SpellE">Merita</span> Rosario, who was living in the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
house at the time of the incident, and who testified that she heard such
struggle from their bedroom.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The presence of blood stains inside the house also supports the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> version that upon arriving from the mountain at
around midnight of December 2, 1979, he heard his wife crying for help and upon
going up, he surprised the victim having carnal knowledge of her, after which
the fight between him and the victim started inside the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Corroborating this is the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Merita</span> Rosario, who stated that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
wife woke her up in the middle of the night, "trembling and afraid",
and informed her that her Uncle Domingo and one <span class="SpellE">Dadoy</span>
were fighting each other<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>,
after which said witness went downstairs and ran immediately to the house of
"grandmother <span class="SpellE">Binay</span>" (mother of the victim)
to fetch her to go to the house of the Barrio Captain to seek assistance, but
they went instead to the house of <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> Gonzales
whom she woke up, after which they proceeded to the residence of the Barrio
Captain.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">That the wife, Martha <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>,
mentioned nothing of the assault on her honor to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain that early morning when she went there to ask for assistance, nor did she
testify on that happening, does not militate against the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
version as the transcript shows that Martha had started to testify but the
Trial Judge opined that she needed the consent of her husband, the accused, to
do so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
When the defense counsel dispensed with her testimony, it is likely that the
accused did not want to expose his wife and his family to the dishonor and
disrepute that would result from the exposure of the cause of the fight in a
public trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused was apparently a mild-mannered man for his immediate
reaction upon seeing the victim atop his wife was to say "why <span class="SpellE">Compadre</span> are you doing this to my wife".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It was only after the victim drew the bolo under his hat which he had picked up
that the accused retaliated and did so unrelentingly, taunted by the victim who
had told him "anyway, I fucked your wife".<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> declaration that upon
surprising the victim, the latter pulled up his pants hurriedly and was about
to leave, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is further confirmed by the
"physical findings" in the Medical Certificate of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ranulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Parras</span> (Exhibit

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">That the bolo used by the
victim was not presented as evidence by the defense should neither be taken
against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter, while
incarcerated, had asked his children to look for it but it could no longer be
found, the house having been abandoned soon after the incident out of fear by
the wife and the fact that the breadwinner of the family had been incarcerated
and was not allowed to post bail. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Additionally supportive
of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> version is the fact that the accused
himself had suffered incised wounds of "4-5 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>.
lateral aspect, dorsum (1) hand' 2-3 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>. distal end
index finger (1); and 3-4 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>. lat. aspect of right
knee" (Exhibit "1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although apparently superficial, his wounds were found by the police to
have been bleeding for which reason, they immediately took him to the Municipal
Health Officer for treatment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the accused took to flight because he was found by the police in barrio <span class="SpellE">Loob</span> hiding in the "<span class="SpellE">buho</span>"
grove.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he had explained, he was so
overcome by remorse over what he had done that he actually did not hide but
just sat there until help from his relatives could come.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, when found by the police, he
immediately turned over his bolo and went with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

answering the call of nature, the accused suddenly hacked the victim by the
side of the road after which the witness ran away in fright to report to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain, do not and cannot explain the blood
stains inside the house, and from there, the blood stains to the exact spot
where the victim was found sprawled flat on his back, as well as the blood
stains from the side of the road where pieces of the skull and brain tissue
were found, to the said spot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The explanation of the
Trial Court to the effect that the accused had gone back to the house before he
went into "hiding", which would account for the blood stains thereat,
is not plausible because the accused himself testified that he went direct to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Loob</span>, Labrador, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> where he and his wife had relatives</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Gonzales' version is
further refuted by <span class="SpellE">Merita</span> Rosario's testimony that
after having been awakened by Martha <span class="SpellE">Banasen</span>, she and
grandmother <span class="SpellE">Binay</span> whom she fetched immediately
proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> Gonzales and woke
him up, and together, they went to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain to report the incident and to ask for help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, Gonzales gave inconsistent
declarations when he stated in his Affidavit (Exhibit "2"), that
three persons held the victim (Exhibit "2-A") but that he recognized
only the accused, whereas on the witness stand he declared that only the
accused attacked the victim suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">These inconsistencies
aside from the fact that his version does not <span class="SpellE">compaginate</span>
with other factual circumstances surrounding the case strongly militate against
his credibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The next </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">point </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to consider is the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> plea of defense
of the person of his spouse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
facts, as established by the evidence, we find that the three requisites
required by law to justify the offense under paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the
Revised Penal Code are present, namely, unlawful aggression; reasonable
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and in case the
provocation was given by the person attacked, that the one making the defense
had no part therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused upon coming
home, caught the victim in the act of raping his (<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>)
wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, a fight, commenced by
the victim, ensued, both <span class="SpellE">protogonists</span> using their
respective <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>, culminating in the fatal wounding
of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances under
which the victim was hacked to death by the accused, as already discussed
above, prove that the accused merely made use of his legitimate right to defend
the honor of his wife, and neither did he provoke the affair nor had any part
therein, consequently, he incurs no criminal responsibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Where a husband entered his house one morning while it was
yet dark and surprised a person in the act of holding his wife by the hands,
with the intention of laying her on the floor and lying with her, if his first
impulse was to inflict upon the aggressor a rather serious wound on one of the
arms, he undoubtedly acted in defense of the person and rights of his offended
wife; he made use of a legitimate right, one which is included in article 8,
No. 5, of the Penal Code, inasmuch as there concurred the three requisites
required by the law; neither of the spouses provoked the affair nor gave the
wounded man any occasion to enter the house, in which the woman was alone at a
very early hour <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the morning,
and the husband, on seeing that a man was making a violent attempt upon the
honor of his wife, found himself obliged to repel and prevent his attempt,
availing himself as a rational means of the bolo which he carried, and for this
reason he is exempt from all responsibility and should be absolved."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In fact, it can even be
