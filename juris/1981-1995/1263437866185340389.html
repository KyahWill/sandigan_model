				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Fantasizing that the rape charge filed against him was perhaps an
opportunity to project the immensity of his manhood, the accused bounces in his
defense that if he indeed inserted his organ into complaining victim's the
latter should have suffered serious if not devastating lacerations in her
hymen.  But the Court is not amused with
his display of vanity and narcissism, for rape can be committed even with the
slightest insertion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eleven-year old victim Maryjane Nicolas narrates that on 26 March
1992, at around nine o'clock in the evening, she and her two (2) younger sisters
were sleeping in the bedroom of their house at 103 Palyasan, Bgy. Burgos,
Rodriguez, Rizal.  Later, she woke up
and found herself lying down on the cold cement floor of their living room,
already without her shorts and pantie.  She looked around and saw a naked man whose face was covered.  Immediately, the man laid on top of her and
inserted his organ into hers.  She
struggled and pushed him away, uncovering his face in the process.  She recognized accused-appellant who resides
only some three houses away.  She told
him to leave.  But he would not;
instead, he followed her to the bedroom and held her on her buttocks and sex
organ.  Escaping from his hold, she went
back to the living room and switched on the lights, forcing him to put on his
underwear and pants, and then leave, after which, she went back to sleep.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Maryjane's mother, Melinda, was not in their house when the
incident happened.  She was vending
"balut" in the neighborhood.  It was around one o'clock the following morning when she arrived.  She was surprised to find the front door of
their house locked from the inside.  She
locked it from the outside before leaving the night before to enable her to use
her key and enter their house in the early hours of the following morning
without waking up her children.  Since
she could not open the door when she arrived, she called out for Maryjane.  It was her seven-year old May-anne who
opened the door and told her that a man had entered their house.  Melinda then woke Maryjane up and asked her
what happened.  Maryjane just cried and
could not answer.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Later in the morning, Maryjane confessed to her mother that it was
accused-appellant Allan Junio who entered their house.  She could not reveal to her mother what
exactly happened for fear that appellant might kill her as he threatened to.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At around eleven o'clock that same morning Melinda, suspecting
that something had happened to her daughter, reported the incident to the
barangay authorities who immediately turned to the police.  The police, upon learning from Maryjane the
identity of her defiler, promptly arrested the accused and detained him at the
municipal jail.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, in the afternoon, while Maryjane and her mother were in the
police station giving their respective statements,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> they
were called in by Mayor Lito Manuel of Rodriguez, Rizal.  Inside the Mayor's Office, Maryjane told the
Mayor in private that the accused had raped her.  Mayor Manuel gave her P200.00 and advised her to go to Camp
Crame, Quezon City, to undergo physical examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 March 1992, before undergoing physical examination,
Maryjane admitted to her mother that she was raped by Allan Junio.  Thus Maryjane and her mother promptly
returned to the police station and gave additional statements.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span style="">following </span>day, Maryjane was
examined by Dr. Jesusa O. Nieves, Senior Inspector, Philippine National Police,
who thereafter issued her Medico-Legal Report No. M-0560-92.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Dr. Nieves later testified that "[b]ased on my examination, my findings on
the genitalia reveals a recent loss of virginity" which had occurred
within seven (7) days from the time of examination, as evidenced by
"healing lacerations at 8:00 o'clock and 4:00 o'clock."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 April 1994, a Complaint-Information duly signed by Maryjane,
assisted by her mother, and 2nd <span style="">Asst. Prosecutor
</span>Romulo I. Na√±ola charging accused Allan Junio of rape was filed with the
Regional Trial Court of San Mateo, Rizal,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> and
raffled to Branch 76.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> On
22 April 1992, the accused entered a plea of "not guilty." On 15 July
1992, pending trial, the accused then detained in the Municipal Jail of
Rodriguez, Rizal, escaped.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, trial continued <i><span style="">in
absentia </span></i>during which the prosecution presented its witnesses,
including Maryjane.  Then, sometime in
August 1992, 3rd Asst. Prosecutor Jose V. Nitura moved to dismiss the case,
attaching to his motion an Affidavit of Desistance dated "April
1992," signed by Maryjane Nicolas and her mother, Melinda Nicolas.  Notwithstanding the supposed "Affidavit
of Desistance" Maryjane continued to testify and in fact completed her
testimony on 18 November 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a formal offer of evidence, the prosecution rested.  Thereafter, the case was reset for the
presentation of the evidence by the defense.  Later, however, the defense waived the testimonies of its witnesses;
instead, it presented two (2) documents, i.e., a Motion to Dismiss and an
Affidavit of Desistance which, according to the prosecution, have both been
withdrawn by the complainant herself when she subsequently proceeded with her
testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 1 February 1993, the accused was re-arrested by the
police.  On 25 March 1993, the Regional
Trial Court of San Mateo, Rizal, Br. 76, rendered its decision finding the
accused guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt, sentenced him to <i>reclusion
perpetua, </i>and ordered him to indemnify Maryjane in the amount of
P30,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused is now before us on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reviewing rape cases, we are guided by these time-honored
principles:  (a) An accusation for rape
can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove, but more difficult for the
person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) In view of the intrinsic
nature of the crime of rape where only two (2) persons are usually involved,
the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and,
(c) The evidence for the prosecution must stand and fall on its own merits, and
cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the
defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
A careful assessment of the evidence more than sufficiently shows that
accused-appellant is guilty beyond doubt of the crime charged.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The candid and straightforward narration by victim Maryjane of
how she was raped, as borne by the records and the transcript of stenographic
notes, bears the earmarks of credibility.  And, courts usually lend credence to the testimony of a young girl
especially where the facts point to her having been a victim of sexual assault.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
For sure, Maryjane would not make public the offense, undergo the troubles and
humiliation of a public trial <span style="">and </span>endure
the ordeal of testifying to all its gory details if she had not in fact been in
fact raped, for no decent Filipina would publicly admit she had been raped
unless it was the truth.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> As a
rule, a victim of rape will not come out in the open if her motive were not to
obtain justice, and her testimony as to who abused her is credible where she
has absolutely no motive to incriminate and testify against the accused,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
as <span style="">in </span>the instant case.  Thus, when a woman says that she has been
raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed
and if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be
convicted solely on the basis thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> And
considering that Maryjane was then only eleven-years old, accused is guilty of
statutory rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the attempt of accused-appellant Junio to
muddle the case of the prosecution is unavailing.  He argues that the testimonies and statements of prosecution
witnesses are replete with contradictions.  Thus, Maryjane in her first extrajudicial statement averred that
accused-appellant merely made an attempt on her virtue, which allegation was
echoed by her mother in the latter's own statement to the police,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
only to return three days later to charge accused-appellant of rape.  Then, in her open court testimony, Maryjane
merely said that accused-appellant held her on her buttocks and organ,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
which was also repeated by her mother on the witness stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is totally bereft of merit.  Maryjane cannot be blamed for her seeming
vacillation which is more apparent than real.  Her initial reluctance to inform her mother and the authorities that she
was indeed raped is conceivable considering her tender age and the humiliation
she will suffer.  A young woman who has
just been sexually assaulted is not expected to immediately regain composure as
she is at that point confused and dazed by the experience.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court has said that "the silence of the offended party in a case of
rape, or her failure to disclose her defilement without loss of time to persons
close to her and to report the matter to the authorities, does not perforce
warrant the conclusion that she was not sexually molested and that her charges
against the accused are all baseless, untrue and fabricated.  Other relevant facts and circumstances must
be considered to determine the veracity of the accusation."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Fear of reprisal not only from the accused but from the members of his family
as well is a valid excuse for the momentary reticence of the victim and
prosecution witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, there is nothing unusual with Maryjane's hesitation as this is perfectly
in accord with human nature.  The victim
of rape being then in a very tender age and utterly innocent of the ways of the
world, her temporary silence could be understandable.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While Maryjane indeed said in open court that accused-appellant
held her on her buttocks and organ, she explained that that happened after the
rape.  Thus, she testified -</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's indulgence in other alleged inconsistencies
is simply a result of his confusion on the chronology of events, if they were
not minor and trivial differences, which is not worthy of the full attention of
this Court.  After all, inconsistencies
on minor, trivial or inconsequential matters do not affect the credibility of a
witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution cannot be faulted likewise for not presenting
May-anne as a witness, as stressed by the defense.  It has been held time and again that the non?presentation
of certain witnesses is not a sufficiently plausible defense, and the matter of
whom to present as witness by the prosecution is addressed to the sound
discretion of the fiscal or the prosecution handling the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Unfavorable inferences made on the non-presentation of seven-year old May-anne
are mere speculations which cannot defeat, much less weaken, the positive
testimony of the victim herself.  In
fact, in rape cases, the accused may be convicted solely on the testimony of
the complaining witness provided such testimony is credible, natural,
convincing and otherwise consistent with human nature and the course of things.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's submission that the execution of an Affidavit of
Desistance by complainant who was assisted by her mother supported the
"inherent incredibility of prosecution's evidence"<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
is specious.  <span style="">We </span>have said in so many cases that retractions are generally
unreliable and are looked upon with considerable disfavor by the courts.  The unreliable character of this document is
shown by the fact that it is quite incredible that after going through the
process of having accused-appellant arrested by the police, positively
identifying him as the person who raped her, enduring the humiliation of a
physical examination of her private parts, and then repeating her accusations
in open court by recounting her anguish, Maryjane would suddenly turn around
and declare that "[a]fter a careful deliberation over the case, (she)
find(s) that the same does not merit or warrant criminal prosecution."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, we have declared that at most the retraction is an
afterthought which should not be given probative value.  It would be a dangerous rule to reject the
testimony taken before the court of justice simply because the witness who has
given it later on changed his mind for one reason or another.  Such a rule will make a solemn trial a
mockery and place the investigation at the mercy of unscrupulous
witnesses.  Because affidavits of
retraction can easily be secured from poor and ignorant witnesses, usually for
monetary consideration, the Court has invariably regarded such affidavits as
exceedingly unreliable.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While "[t]he offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts
of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the
offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor in any case, if
the offender has been expressly pardoned by the above named persons, as the
case may be,"<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> the
pardon to justify the dismissal of the complaint should have been made prior to
the institution of the criminal action.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, the motion to dismiss to which the affidavit of desistance is attached
was filed after the institution of the criminal case.  And, affiant did not appear to be serious in "signifying
(her) intention to refrain from testifying"<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
since she still completed her testimony notwithstanding her earlier affidavit
of desistance.  More, the affidavit is
suspect considering that while it was dated "April 1992," it was only
submitted sometime in August 1992, four (4) months after the Information was
filed before the court <i>a quo </i>on 6 April 1992, perhaps dated as such to
coincide with the actual filing of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we find too preposterous and unfeeling the submission of
appellant that "the deep laceration at 8:00 o'clock and shallow laceration
at 4:00 o'clock found in the hymen of the complainant were more consistent with
the possible insertion of appellant's right middle finger and its consequent
movement done in fingering a woman's organ to excite and arouse her, preparatory
to coitus, than the actual penetration of her private organ by
accused-appellant's penis <span style="">x x x x </span>The
natural pressure resulting from the penetration of appellant's penis in the
vagina of an eleven-year old child must be too severe such that lacerations if
caused will be found all around the entrance of the organ not just on the left
and right (sides)."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a> The
arguments of accused-appellant who has failed to substantiate his
pronouncements are not facts but rather mere self-pleasing statements consistent
with his self-infatuation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>finding accused-appellant
ALLAN JUNIO y CORTEZ guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape,
imposing upon him a prison term of <i><span style="">reclusion
