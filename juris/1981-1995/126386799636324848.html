 March 1989</st1:date>, the victim Edison <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> a.k.a. Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, was
inside the <span class="SpellE">Buenamina</span> Quality Furniture Store on <st1:place><st1:placename>A.</st1:placename>

and which also served as his residence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was watching his employees Romeo <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> y <span class="SpellE">Pabon</span> and one lady worker known only as <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ukit</span> bringing inside the store the merchandise or
furniture on display because they were about to close shop for that day (TSN,
23 May 1989, pp. 6 &amp; 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Ukit</span> left the store at
about 6:30 p.m. (<u>Id</u>., p. 15), while prosecution eyewitness Romeo <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> stayed behind since he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">invited by the </span>victim to a disco to celebrate the latter's
birthday the next day, April 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Id</u>,
p. 20)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of the same date, the display area of the store was already
closed, witness <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> heard the sound of the buzzer
and saw the victim <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> open the door leading to the
<span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> let in the appellant Gonzales and his co-accused
Lorenzo to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> which is separated by a glass
divider (<u>Id</u>., pp. 6-7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
heard them watching a film on <span class="SpellE">betamax</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:state><st1:place><u>Id</u>.</st1:place></st1:state>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time>,
while <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> was in the store waiting for the victim
to call him, he heard a commotion (‘something fell’) coming from the adjacent
room where the visitors and the victim were.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He ignored it as he was then in the store arranging and holding a flower
pot (<u>Id</u>., pp. 8 &amp; <span style="">19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when he heard another sound of an
object falling, <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> hurriedly peeped through the
transparent glass separating the store and the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
where the victim, appellant Gonzales and his co?</span>accused Lorenzo
were watching <span class="SpellE">betamax</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw appellant Gonzales and co-accused
Lorenzo stabbing the victim <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Gonzales <span style="">was </span><span style="">using what appeared
to be a hunting knife, </span>with a hook and jagged edge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Id</u>., pp. 9-10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After stabbing the victim, Lorenzo went
inside the other <span class="SpellE">sala</span> where the victim entertained
his close friends and relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> then hid himself for fear of being silenced by the
assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Id</u>., <span style="">p. 11).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, who was then mortally
wounded, was still able to reach the door (from whence appellant Gonzales and
Lorenzo entered) and managed to shout for help.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the neighbors came and broke down the door, the victim slumped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Initially, the people <span style="">did not go inside afraid that the robbers may still be in the
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the neighbors were </span>preparing
to bring the victim to the hospital, witness <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span>
managed to slip away and he went to report the incident to the victim's elder
sister <span class="SpellE">Estrelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> who
lived nearby (<u>Id</u>., p. 11).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The victim was dead on arrival at the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death was diagnosed by the NBI
Medico-Legal Officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Reyes, as: severe
hemorrhage secondary to multiple stab wounds The victim sustained 26 stab
wounds, 24 of which <span style="">were fatal, located
in the chest and abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, 30 May
1989, pp. 4-9).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There was a sign of struggle as indicated by the incised
wounds in the <span class="SpellE">scaphalanges</span> and fingers resulting from
the instinctive reflex defense actions of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Id</u>., p. 7).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Estrellita</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, the victim's sister, arrived at the crime scene at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00 p.m.</st1:time> only to find that
the victim was no longer there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
stayed in the office and <span class="SpellE">sala</span> because the people
present prevented her from going to the residence area as the two men who
killed the victim might still be inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a few minutes, the policemen arrived and they entered the building
and some even climbed the roof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
moments later, she was informed that appellants Gonzales and Lorenzo were
apprehended one after the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Estrellita's</span> sister <span class="SpellE">Luningning</span>
arrived, both of them proceeded to the police station (TSN, 29 May 1989, pp.
28-29), but not before padlocking the door and requesting the neighbors to
watch over the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, 30 May 1989,
p. 32).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1:00 a.m.</st1:time> the next morning, after the

appellants present a different version.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They claim that at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1989</st1:date>,
they and a certain Gary "<span class="SpellE">Kabayo</span>" were on their
way to the house of Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> for a birthday
party, as well as to <span style="">a </span>disco
thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, Gary told them
to go ahead as he had to go back to <span style="">his
</span>house for something he had left, promising to rejoin them at the
victim's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants arrived at
and were welcomed by the victim in his house, but shortly thereafter the
latter's brother arrived and they were requested to leave awhile as the victim
had to attend to his brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went
to and stayed in a nearby store for some time and, after the victim's brother
and helpers left, they went back to the victim's house and were ushered by him
into the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">sala</span></span><span style=""> </span>where they watched <span class="SpellE">betamax</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
appear that assailants were aware that <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> had
stayed behind in the house; in fact, they denied his presence therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">After sometime, <st1:city><st1:place>Gary</st1:place></st1:city>
arrived but after sensing that he was under the influence of drugs ("<span class="SpellE">sabog</span>"), the victim tried <span style="">to </span>dissuade the former from going with them to the disco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was supposedly on the advice of
appellant Lorenzo since the victim was the celebrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Gary</st1:place></st1:city>
agreed not to join them in the disco but he asked for some money which the
victim refused to give.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After some
verbal exchanges, <st1:city><st1:place>Gary</st1:place></st1:city> subjected
the victim to indignities and slapped him, whereupon the latter dashed to his
room and came back with a gun which he poked at <st1:city><st1:place>Gary</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Gary</st1:place></st1:city>
was able to parry the gun, which was thrown away, and then he drew out a knife
and repeatedly stabbed the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Lorenzo claims that he was so confused such that he was
unable to assist the victim and, fearing for his life, he went to the second
floor where he forcibly opened the door and proceeded to the rooftop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From there, he jumped down to the ground and
heard people shouting "<span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>" (thief, thief)) and then the onlookers
mauled him until he became unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he regained consciousness at the city jail, he immediately informed
his mother, who was beside him, that it was not he but Gary who stabbed the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he used to
visit the victim's place once, twice or thrice a week.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Gonzales testified that he followed appellant Lorenzo
to the rooftop, but when he saw <st1:city><st1:place>Gary</st1:place></st1:city>
he lay flat on the roof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later,
policemen arrived, poked their gun at him and effected his arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied that the policemen were able to get
P1,711.00 from his pocket since, at that time, he had only P111.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further denied having stabbed the victim,
insisting that it was only Gary who committed the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also claimed that it was the first time
that he had gone to the victim's house.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1989, the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before us on appeal, with each appellant
represented by his own counsel and filing a separate brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Lorenzo contends that the trial
court erred in (1) giving credence to the testimony of the supposed eyewitness
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> and holding that the same was logical,
straightforward and probable; (2) finding that the accused had confirmed <span class="SpellE">Rotone's</span> presence when the stabbing occurred; (3) holding
that accused Lorenzo was one of the perpetrators of the stabbing incident; (4)
holding that accused Lorenzo conspired with the perpetrators in the commission
of the offense charged; and (5) convicting accused Lorenzo of the crime of
robbery with homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Gonzales’ assignment of errors faults the lower court
for (1) giving weight to the testimonies of P/Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Abner</span>
Castro and <span style="">Pat. </span>Alexander <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span>, both of the <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City
Police Department, regarding their investiga­tion of appellant Gonzales because
said investigation was done in violation of appellant's constitutional <span style="">right under </span>Section 12 of the Bill of
Rights; (2) admitting in evidence the affidavits of P/Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Abner</span>
Castro and Pat. Alexander <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span>, Exhibits
"D" and "E," for the reason that said affidavits blatantly
show a failure of compliance with the constitutional guarantee afforded
appellant Gonzales under Section 12 of the Bill of Rights; and (3) giving
weight and credence to the testimony of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span>,
the alleged eyewitness, for, on closer examination, said testimony is full of
contradictions and simply beyond belief, thus creating a strong reasonable
doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore, evident that the resolution of this case hinges
on the issue of credibility and the correctness of the factual findings of the
court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are accordingly constrained to advert to and rely on the rule,
well established in this jurisdiction, that in the absence of any fact or
circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the
significance of which has been misconstrued as to impeach the findings of the
trial court, the appellate courts will not interfere with the trial court's
findings on the credibility of witnesses, or set aside its judgment,
considering that it is in a better position to decide the question, having
heard the witnesses themselves during the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of assigning values to declarations at the witness
stand is best and most completely performed or, carried out by a trial judge
who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimony in the light of
defendant's behavior, demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial, and the
conclusions of trial courts command great weight and respect.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the accepted rule is that in weighing contradictory declarations and
statements, greater weight must generally be given to the positive testimony of
the prosecution witnesses than to the denials of the defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A painstaking review of the records of and the evidence submitted
in this case brings us to the conclusion that no cogent reason exists as would
justify a departure from the foregoing rules in determining the culpability of
appellants for the special complex crime with which they are charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants, however, insist in this appeal that one Gary "<span class="SpellE">Kabayo</span>" was the only person responsible for the
stabbing of Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory of appellants collides with the
categorical testimony of the prosecution witness, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span>,
to the effect that he actually saw the victim being simultaneously stabbed by
both appellants in the receiving room or <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is established that witness <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> could not have been mistaken as to the identities of
appellants as, prior to March 31,1989, he had seen or met both appellants three
(3) times when they went to the shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the occasion of the stabbing incident, he clearly saw them through a
transparent <span style="">glass </span>in the
dividing wall of the adjacent room where he was at the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
No derogatory motive has been adduced as would <span class="SpellE">devalorize</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rotone's</span> testimony and militate against the
credibility and weight thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants assail the credit given by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
to the testimony of said prosecution witness for being supposedly illogical,
absurd and improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Lorenzo
claims that it is most unlikely that <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> was ever
present at the scene of the crime since the latter did not even take any action
to aid the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This overlooks the
well-known fact that one cannot rely merely on how one believes a person should
behave since there is no standard as to how a person may react to a shocking
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> explained that he hid himself for fear that he would
also be attacked by appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, while appellants maintain that one Gary "<span class="SpellE">Kabayo</span>" was the person solely responsible for the
crime, they have utterly failed to prove the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from appellant's allegations, no
evidence was ever presented to prove the existence of said Gary "<span class="SpellE">Kabayo</span>" nor was there any proof of the supposed
person's presence at the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such pretension of appellants cannot prevail over the affirmative
assertions of witness <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> which was bolstered by
the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Reyes, the medico-legal
examiner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Reyes explained without
contradiction that the incised wounds of the <span class="SpellE">scaphalanges</span>
and fingers of the victim were due to his reflex defensive actions and were
thereby indicative of a struggle among the protagonists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also stressed that considering the multiple
stab wounds inflicted on the victim, 26 stab wounds of which 24 were fatal, the
possibility is that there was more than one assailant.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not err in holding that appellants conspired
with each other in the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prove conspiracy, the prosecution need not
establish that all the parties thereto agreed to every detail in the execution
of the crime or that they were actually together at all the stages of the
conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that, from the
individual acts of each accused, it may reasonably be deduced that they had a
common plan to commit the felony.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, there is conspiracy if the evidence presented by
the prosecution clearly indicates that the acts and behavior of the accused reveal
their common purpose to assault and inflict harm upon the deceased and that
there was a concerted execution of that common purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the witness to specifically identify the appellant
who inflicted the lethal stab wounds on the victim is not critical or
essential, since the conspiracy between appellants was duly alleged and proven
at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there is conspiracy,
a showing as to who inflicted the fatal blow is not required.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the robbery charged as a component of the subject
composite crime, we reject appellant Gonzalez’ protestations that the money
retrieved from his person was merely "planted" by the policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No plausible reason was even advanced as to
why and how said officers could have resorted to such incriminatory
fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rapidity and sequence
of events -- the alarm raised by the cries for help of the victim, the
immediate response of his neighbors, the timely arrival of the police and the
apprehension of appellants shortly thereafter -- these render remote the
possibility that other persons engineered the robbery and foisted that felony
on appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While only a portion of
the proceeds of such crime was recovered, that suffices to establish their
culpability for the robbery by reason or on the occasion of which the murder
was committed by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Save for
the robbery aspect, the records do not reveal or suggest any other possible
reason for their simultaneous criminal and fatal assault on the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <u><span style="">People </span>vs.</u><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Pacala</span></span></u><span style="">, </span><u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
is however, raised against our considering robbery as a component of the crime
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument premised thereon
was also involved in <u><span style="">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Espera</span>, et al</span></u><span style="">.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
where, in view of the variance in the factual setting <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
that <span style="">in </span>the case at bar, we
adopted this pragmatic response:</p>

<blockquote>"To the same effect, as noted by Mr. Justice Padilla, is the
doctrine in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pacala</span></u>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,
where it was held that absent conclusive evidence that robbery has actually
taken place, there can be no conviction for the composite crime <span style="">of robbery with homicide, but only for
homicide which was duly proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
this holding has been criticized </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">inaccurate, We are persuaded to
hold it as an applicable determinant for our present purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It observes fidelity to the fundamental rule
that criminal law should yield any reasonable doubt in favor of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least in the factual milieu
of the present case, the acceptance of the foregoing doctrines would not
constitute an exacting onus on the criminal justice system and the law
enforcement agencies by seemingly demanding that there be an eyewitness to
prove the actual </span><span class="SpellE"><u>apoderamiento</u></span><span style=""> in crimes like robbery or theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, further to what has already been said,
in the case at bar, there is a paucity of evidence showing that, other than the
accused, </span>no <span style="">other person had or
could have had access to the premises where the money and the watch were
allegedly kept, either before or after the killing of the victim and until the
loss was supposedly discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
possibil­ity that there could have been other intruders enhances the element of
doubt in favor of appellants on this score."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier explained, in the present case the circumstances are
such that only the malefactors, during the swift succession of events that
accompanied and followed the killing, could have had access to the money found
in the possession of appellant Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No outsiders were able to intrude into the premises and, shortly
thereafter, the police arrived and apprehended the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To require eyewitnesses to the robbery, as <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Pacala</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>would imply, would be too
unreasonable and exacting in the face of ample circums­tantial evidence, not
speculations, a rational appreciation of which evidence establishes appellants'
culpability for robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as early
as <u><span style="">U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Merin</span></span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court declared that "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)n the absence of
any other known motive for the crime, it would be, in our judgment, to reject
the universal teaching of experience to refuse to draw the inference that the
same person who killed the occupants of the house also committed the robbery.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The other objection, under <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacala</u></span>,
that none of the things stolen were recovered does not apply in the instant
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the amount of P1,711.00 was
recovered from appellant Gonzales right at the crime scene, his lame and easily
fabricated excuse being that it was "planted" on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, no amount was retrieved from appellant
Lorenzo but it must be recalled that in trying to escape he jumped into the
avenging arms of the crowd gathered below and he was mauled by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not far-fetched that whatever he had
taken from the victim's house was lost or removed from him during that episode.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amounts and items alleged in the information were merely
based by the prosecutor on information supplied by the investigators and the
victim's siblings and it would be absurd that, to establish the charge of
robbery, there must be proof that appellants actually knew of the existence
thereof or that all of said items be recovered from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less should evidence be required that
appellants went to the victim's house with intent to rob aforethought.</p>

<p class="BODY">That robbery was their purpose appears to be the only logical
deduction, but assuming that they also had the desire to take revenge for
grievances against the victim, still they are liable for robbery with homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Evidently, it is their subsequent actuations at the scene of the crime that
prove what had been and is their primary motive or intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To require direct evidence on this point is
to lend credence to the lament that the law appears to give more rights and
protection to the accused than to the victim and his heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree with the proposition of appellant Gonzales that the
trial court erred in admitting and giving weight to the testimonies of P/Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Abner</span> Castro and Pat. Alexander <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span>
concerning the investigation they conducted on him because the same was
allegedly done in violation of his constitutional right under Section 12 of
Article III of the 1987 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Said appellant, in his
brief, alleges that:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused-appellants in the case, particularly <span class="SpellE">Jeg</span> Gonzales, were brought to the Police Headquarters for
investigation (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 31, <st1:date year="1989" day="20" month="6">20 June 1989</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Balcarse</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also brought to the rooftop near the
place of the incident by Pat. Alexander <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span> and
other policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he was made to
point to a knife (Exhibit 'H') lying on the roof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 9, <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="6">21 June 1989</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Balcarse</span>)
and he allegedly admitted before the policemen that it was the knife he used in
stabbing Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 7, <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="5">22 May 1989</st1:date>, <st1:city><st1:place>Aviles</st1:place></st1:city>),
in his affidavit,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 'D', Pat.
Alexander <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span>, referring to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Jeg</span></span><span style=""> </span>Gonzales, states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘That
suspect when conducted spot interrogation verbally admitted having as (sic) one
of the suspects who stabbed and carted away the money.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the right of a person under interrogation to be
informed of his right to remain silent and to counsel implies a correlative
obligation on the part of the police investigator to explain, and contemplates
an effective communication that results in the understanding of what is
conveyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Short of this is a denial of
the right, as it cannot truly be said that the accused has been informed of his
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the "informing"
done by the police was nothing more than <span style="">a
</span>superficial and mechanical act, performed not so much to attain the
objectives of the fundamental law as to gi<span style="">ve
a semb</span>l<span style="">a</span>nce of compliance
with it, the constitutional mandate is not complied with.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What <span style="">must </span>not be
lost sight of, however, is that said constitutional provision prohibits as
evidence only confessions and admissions of the accused and only as against
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, we agree with this
comment of the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>"Thus, granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that
the constitutional rights of appellant were indeed violated by P/Cpl Castro and
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span>, it is respectfully submitted that only
appellant's testimony taken in violation thereof should be inadmissible
evidence-but not the affidavits and testimonies of these two police officers,
notwithstanding appellant's claim to the effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, the testimonies of P/Cpl Castro and Pat.
<span class="SpellE">Gatus</span>, especially with respect to their having gone
to the scene of the crime, the recovery on the rooftop thereof of the knife
used in killing the victim (TSN, 22 May 1989, p. 7), and the recovery by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span> of the amount of P1,711.00 <span style="">in </span>the person of the appellant (<u>Id</u>.,
p<span style="">. </span>8), could not be expunged from
the records as they are not affected by the alleged inadmissibility of
appellant's own extrajudicial confession."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, from the preceding discussion of the facts of this case
and the evidence for the People, we are convinced that even if said appellant's
extrajudicial confession would be disregarded, the evidence of the prosecution
is sufficient to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the inexplicable fact that appellants ran away from the
scene of the crime is a significant indication of their guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants used the door exit on the second
floor and proceeded to the rooftop from where they obviously thought of jumping
off to an adjacent building and, thence, to the street below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such behavior cannot but be positive and
convincing evidence of their consciousness of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had they really been as blameless <span style="">as </span>they would now pose, there was
nothing that would have prevented them from proceeding to the front door and
opening the same to meet the victim's neighbors who had congregated outside in
response to the victim's cries for help, and then forthwith proclaim their
innocence by spontaneously denouncing the so-called Gary "<span class="SpellE">Kabayo</span>" as the culprit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the challenged judgment of the trial court is

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING <span style="">OPINION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span style="">PAD</span>ILLA,
<i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the majority opinion insofar <span style="">as </span>it affirms the trial court's
judgment finding that the appellants killed the victim Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony
of prosecution witness Romeo <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> <u>positively</u>
identified the appellants <span style="">as </span>the perpetrators of the felony and <u>clearly</u> described
the manner in which the killing was done, which was at least characterized by
the abuse of superior number and commission in the victim's abode.</p>

<p class="BODY">But I dissent insofar as the crime is classified as <u>robbery</u>
<u>with</u> <u>homicide</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Robbery with homicide is primarily a crime against property and
not against persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Homicide is <span style="">a mere </span>incident
in the robbery, the latter being the main purpose and object of the criminal
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pagal</span>, G.R. No. L-32040, <st1:date year="1977" day="25" month="10">25 October 1977</st1:date>, 79 SCRA 570,
576-577).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to sustain a
conviction for the crime of robbery with homicide, it is necessary that the
robbery itself be proven as conclusively as any other essential element of the
crime (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pacala</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-26647,
</span><st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="8"><span class="GramE">15 August
 1974</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 58 SCRA 370, 377).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof of the homicide is insufficient to
prove robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the original
criminal design of the culprit must be to commit robbery and the homicide is
perpetrated with <span style="">a view </span>to the consummation of the robbery (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, G.R. No. 67662, <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="2">9 February 1989</st1:date>, 170 SCRA 149, 162).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there were <u>no</u> <u>eyewitnesses</u> to
the alleged robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence to the
charge of robbery is merely circumstantial in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Estrellita</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, sister of the victim, testified that:</p>

<blockquote>"Later, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1:00 a.m.</st1:time>
the next morning, after the investigation at the police station, they went back
to the store with the same police­men to determine what may have been taken
from the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Missing was the amount
of P100,000.00, <span style="">representing the sales
from that month, which was supposed to have been picked up and deposited by
their brother Val. (TSN, 29 May 1989, p. 31)." (pp. 3-4, majority opinion)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Pat. Alexander <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span>,
a member of the <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City Police, one of the
policemen who responded to the call for assistance at the <span class="SpellE">Buenamina</span>
Furniture Quality Store, also testified that when he arrested accused-appellant
<span class="SpellE">Jeg</span> Gonzales he recovered from the latter the amount
of P1,711.00 (TSN, 30 May 1989, p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, none of the pieces of jewelry that were allegedly stolen was
ever recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence thus adduced only the fact of death of
Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and the fact of loss and recovery of the
amount of P1<span class="GramE">,711.00</span> from accused Gonzales were
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, it must be remembered
that the jewelries and the rest of the money allegedly carted <span style="">away </span>by the
two accused were not recovered from them." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 29)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, considering that appellants were apprehended one after
the other immediately after the incident, it is rather strange that out of the
P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> that was allegedly stolen by the
appellants only the amount of P1,711.00 was recovered from the accused
Gonzales.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the prosecution did not present any evidence showing
that the appellants knew of the <span style="">existence
</span>of the <span style="">money </span>in the amount
of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and of the pieces of jewelry or of the
place where they were allegedly kept.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution also failed to adduce evidence that when appellants went
to the <span class="SpellE">Buenamina</span> Quality Furniture Store on <st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">A.</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Street</st1:placename><st1:placename>,</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Metro Manila, their intention was to rob the victim, Edison <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear, therefore, that the conclusion of the trial
court that herein appellants are "guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of robbery with homicide" is based on mere inference, conjecture and
not upon positive evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="">People vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Pacala</span>, <span class="GramE">supra<span style="text-decoration: none;">.,</span></span></u> this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"1. In
connection with the robbery aspect of the crime charged, two things must be borne
in <span style="">mine:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>first, that there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged robbery;
and second, that none of the things allegedly stolen, namely, the transistor
radio and the trunk purportedly containing the sum of P1,700.00 was ever
recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was, therefore, any
evidence to support the charge of robbery, the same was entirely circumstantial
in character.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacsal</span>
testified that the five accused surrounded the hut, and after <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> fired his pistol, he and his father jumped from the
hut into the ground and ran to a <span style="">place </span>about
sixty meters away where his father was overtaken and attacked by said accused,
and, afterwards, the latter left and proceeded towards the direction of the
hut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
then went to the succor of his father and tried to assist him until <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortaleza</span>, the barrio
captain, arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It was only after
the arrival of the barrio captain that <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> was able
to return to their hut, and discovered that the radio and the trunk where the
money was kept were missing</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is evident from the foregoing that no iota of evidence had
been presented showing that appellants and their companions knew of the
existence of the money in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,700.00</span>, or
of the place where it was allegedly kept, much less is there any positive proof
that when they went to the <span style="">place </span>of
the victim their intention<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was to rob
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem, therefore,
that the trial court's conclusion that it has been ‘established beyond
peradventure of doubt that, taking advantage of the night, five men decided to
rob the deceased whom they knew to have some money in the trunk …,’ is based on
a mere inference, <span style="">or conjecture and not
upon positive evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is <span style="">well-settled that in order to sustain a
conviction for the crime of robbery with homicide, it is necessary that the
robbery itself be proven </span>as conclusively as any other essential element
of a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In order for the crime </u><u><span style="">of </span>robbery with homicide to exist, it
is necessary that it be clearly established that a robbery ha</u><u><span style="">s </span>actually taken place, and that, </u><u><span style="">as a </span>consequence
or on the occasion of such robbery, a homicide be committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the evidence does not conclusively
prove the robbery, the killing of the victim would, there­fore, be classified
either as a simple homicide or murder, depending upon the absence or presence
of any qualifying circumstance, and not the complex offense of robbery with
homicide</u>." (Underscoring supplied)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
