<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THAT VENUE IN THE HEREIN CASE IS RESPECTFULLY
SUBMITTED TO BE IMPROPERLY LAID."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the question of venue
it is alleged that the proper venue for Civil Case No. 1395 should be </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> where the plaintiff resides and as

this finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent the claim that <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City had been stipulated as the venue, suffice it to
say that a stipulation as to venue does not preclude the filing of suits in the
residence of plaintiff or defendant under Section 2(b), Rule 4, Rules of Court,
in the absence of qualifying or restrictive words in the agreement which would
indicate that the place named is the only venue agreed upon by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The stipulation did not

<p class="BODY">However, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe that the first
ground invoked in the motion to dismiss is well-taken; the respondent judge
should have dismissed Civil Case No. 1395 on that ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 16, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court provides that a motion to
dismiss an action may be <span class="GramE">made,</span> <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, on the ground that "there is another
action pending between the same parties for the same cause."</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been said that for this ground to be invoked "there
must be, between the action under consideration and the other action, (1)
identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interest in both
actions; (2) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief
being founded on the same facts; and (3) the identity on the two preceding
particulars should be such that any judgment which may be rendered on the other
action will, regard­less of which party is successful, amount to <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">adjudicata</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>in
the action under consideration." (1 Moran, Rules of Court, pp. 488-­489
[1970].)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that in so far as the complaint in Civil
Case No. 1395 seeks to collect the P55<span class="GramE">,000</span> alleged
loan, it should be dismissed on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendencia</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>because there is another case on the
same cause pending between them in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with
respect to the claim for P200<span class="GramE">,000</span>, the same can not be
set up in the present action on the ground of multiplicity of suits since
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Maningo's</span> claim under the deed of chattel
mortgage (over the tractor) partook of a compulsory counterclaim which not
having been set up in Civil Case No. 35199 was forever barred under Sec. 4,
Rule 9 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, on the other hand, states that although
the causes of action in Civil Case No. 1395 arose from the Memo­randum
Agreement sued upon in Civil Case No. 35199, the respective causes of action in
the two cases are distinct in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
claims that Civil Case No. 35199 is basically for the performance of certain
supposedly valid obligations whereas Civil Case No. 1395 is prin­cipally for
collection of over due accounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
argues that on the assumption that the petitioner succeeds in compelling the
private respondent to perform under the Memorandum Agreement, the private
respondent would not be barred from seeking judgment in a separate case for the
loan and the purchase price of the tractor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, he maintains that the evidence to support the claims in the two
actions <span class="GramE">are</span> not the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the position of the petitioner tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim of the private respondent for
P55,000 admittedly arose from the same transaction i.e., the Memorandum of
Agreement sued upon in Civil Case No. 35199, notwithstanding that no mention of
the agreement is made in Civil Case No. 1395. Moreover, it appears that in the
answer with a counterclaim filed by the private res­pondent as the defendant in
Civil Case No. 35199, the same amount of P55<span class="GramE">,000</span> was
demanded of the plaintiff therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indubitably, in <span style="">the resolution
of the issues of facts and law in Civil Case No. 35199, relative to the claimed
amount, the right of the private respondent thereto will have to be passed
upon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Similarly, the private
respondent's claim for the purchase price of the tractor is barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim should have been set up in Civil
Case No. 35199, of which, in one of the causes of action it was alleged that
there was a <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> of tractor for which reason
the plaintiff therein asks for the delivery of the tractor specified in the
Memorandum Agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Yu Lay v. <span class="SpellE">Galmes</span> (40 Phil. 651 [1920]), a counterclaim is compulsory
if (a) it matured before answer; (b) it arises out of or is necessarily
connected with the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the
opposing party's claim; (c) it does not require for its adjudication the
presence of third persons of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction; and
(d) it is within the jurisdiction of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in <span class="SpellE">Carpena</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>,
(L-13143, April 26, 1961, 1 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 1060), it was held
that where the <span class="GramE">claim is necessarily connected with or arise</span>
out of the transaction involved in the first case, the same claim is barred if
not set up as a counterclaim in the previous case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that in the light of the jurisprudence cited, the
private respondent's claim for the purchase price of the tractor is in the
nature of a compulsory counterclaim and to allow it in the present action will
violate the principle against multiplicity of suits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is granted; the order of the res­pondent
