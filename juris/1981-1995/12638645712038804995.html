				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pedro Caragao, complainant in Criminal Case No. 87-53321 of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 22,
presided over by the respondent judge, for falsification of public document,
invoking the name of the "People of the Philippines," petitions the
Court for the review on <i>certiorari</i>, under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules
of Court, of two orders of the respondent trial court, dated July 17, 1987 and
August 26, 1987.  The first order
granted the defense motion to quash the information while the second denied the
motion for reconsideration of the first order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy arose from the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 20, 1980, the private respondents sold several
parcels of land located in Dasmariñas, Cavite, in favor of Ricardo
Silverio.  These parcels were at that
time registered in the names of the private respondents.  One of the parcels, covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-110942 of the Registry of Deeds for the province of
Cavite, is the subject matter of a litigation between the private respondents
and Pedro Caragao and his co-owners for reconveyance and cancellation of title
and damages docketed as Civil Case No. TG-493 before Branch XVIII of the
Regional Trial Court of Cavite in Tagaytay City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro Caragao then caused the annotation of a notice of <b>lis
pendens</b> at the back of the original of the Transfer Certificate of Title
(T.C.T.) of the parcel of land under litigation, on file in the Register of
Deeds for the province of Cavite, without the knowledge of the private
respondents.  Hence, the owners’
(private respondents') copy of the title in question did not bear any
annotation of such notice of <b>lis pendens</b>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>private
respondents sold the two parcels of land to Silverio, including the one under
litigation for reconveyance between Caragao and the private respondents, they
warranted that the properties are "free from all liens and encumbrances
whatsoever." Thus the Deed of Sale states:</p>

<blockquote>2.  That for and in consideration of the sum of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">TWELVE </span>MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTEEN
THOUSAND AND NINE HUNDRED TEN PESOS (P12,716,910.00), Philippine Currency, to
be paid by the VENDEE-MORTGAGOR to the VENDOR-MORTGAGEE<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span>as specified hereunder, the latter, by these presents, do hereby
SELL, TRANSFER and CONVEY unto the VENDEE-MORTGAGOR, its heirs, assigns and
successors-in?interests the above-described two (2) parcels of land,
together with all the improvements thereon, free from all liens and
encumbrances <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">whatsoever.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">basis </span>of
this express warranty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">vis-a-vis<b> </b></span>the
notice of <b>lis pendens</b> duly annotated at the back of the original of the
Transfer Certificate of Title (T.C.T.-110942) on file in the Registry of Deeds
for the Province of Cavite, Assistant Fiscal Napoleon V. Dilao of the City of
Manila filed an information for "Falsification of Public Document"
against the private respondents.  The
information reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 20th day of September 1980 in the City of
Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together
and helping one another, being then private persons and with intent to cause
damage to public interest, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously commit acts of falsification on a public document, in the following
manner, to wit:  by then and there
making it appear that a parcel of agricultural land situated at Malinta,
Dasmariñas, Cavite identified as Lot No. 3877-A-1 and now by TCT No. T-110942
is free from all liens and encumbrances, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">is </span>subject of a Deed of Sale With Mortgage signed and executed
in favor of one Ricardo Silverio which was subscribed and sworn to before
Notary Public Carolina L. De Guzman and entered in his (sic) Notarial Registry
As Doc. No. 89, Page 11, Book No. 111, Series of 1980, and therefore a public
document, by making it appear that the said parcel of agricultural land is
"FREE FROM ALL LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES", when in truth and in fact, it
is not, as the accused fully well knew that the subject parcel of land is
subject of litigation in Civil Case No. TG-493 in the Regional Trial Court,
Branch XVIII of Tagaytay City for reconveyance and/or cancellation of title and
damages, as evidenced by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>"Notice
of <b>Lis Pendens</b>” at the back of said TCT No. T-110942 under Entry No.
71086 dated August 9, 1980 and acts (sic) of inscription is (on) August 11,
1980, to the damage and prejudice of public interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before arraignment, the private respondents, accused in the
respondent trial court, filed, under date of June 17, 1987, a "Motion To
Quash" the information, on the ground that the facts charged do not
constitute an offense [Par. (a), Sec. 3, Rule 117, Revised Rules of
Court].  They contended "that a
notice of <b>lis pendens</b> is not a lien or an encumbrance within the
contemplation of the law much less of the parties."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Moreover, the "(a)ccused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">were </span>not
summoned by the Register of Deeds concerning the alleged notice of <b>lis
pendens</b>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
despite the fact that all the parcels of land were, at the time of the sale to
Silverio, registered in the names of the private respondents, accused in the
court below.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents aver that, without their knowledge, Pedro Caragao
had caused the annotation of the notice of <b>lis pendens</b> at the back of
the original copy of the T.C.T. of the land <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">under </span>litigation<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> in
the Register of Deeds for the province of Cavite.  They stress that their (owner's) copy of the T.C.T. in question
is “clean”--it did not bear any annotation of notice of <b>lis pendens</b>.  They assure that prior to the sale, the
accused did not mortgage or otherwise encumber the said property as security
for the payment of any obligation.  They
claim that at the time of the sale on September 20, 1980, the accused believed
that the properties being sold, including the one under litigation, were indeed
free from all liens and encumbrances as they really were.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>quo, in
an order dated July 17, 1987, sustained the private respondents' Motion to
Quash and dismissed the case ruling that a notice of <b>l</b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is pendens</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> is<b> </b></span>not a lien or encumbrance.  The court said:</p>

<blockquote>The motion to quash is well–taken.  A notice of <b>lis pendens</b> is not a lien or encumbrance under our
civil law.  It is a mere cautionary
notice to prospective buyers of certain property that said property is under
litigation, and that any sale made thereof shall be subject to the result of
such litigation.  It imposes no
obligation on the owner, but on the prospective buyer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is to be noted, also, that the clause is merely a formal
statement in sales contained in notarized documents inserted by the drafter of
the deed even without any actual statement by the vendor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

the issuance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the order
granting the Motion to Quash, did Pedro Caragao file<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span>his opposition.  In a
nutshell, he contended that the notice of <b>lis pendens</b> is the evidence of
the lien or encumbrance on the subject property, and not the lien or encumbrance
itself charged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 12, 1987, Pedro Caragao moved for reconsideration of
the July 17, 1987 order of quashal arguing that:</p>

<blockquote>a) The
Notice Of <b>Lis Pendens</b> Is Not The Lien Or Encumbrance Charged In The
INFORMATION, But Merely An Evidence Of Such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>b) The
Information is clear and clear cut that The Lien Or Encumbrance Being Charged
Is The Fact That “The Subject Parcel of Land is Subject of LITIGATION in Civil
Case No. TG-493 x x x as EVIDENCED by the ‘Notice of <b>Lis Pendens</b>’ x x x”</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) Litigation is both an encumbrance and lien on the property being
litigated.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in an order dated August 26, 1987, denied them

<p class="BODY">Even, if we disregard the semantics of the private prosecutor's
first submission, it has no merit nonetheless.</p>

<p class="BODY">Central to the controversy in this case is the issue as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to</span> whether or not a notice of <b>lis
pendens</b> is a lien or encumbrance within the contemplation of criminal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">law, </span>in particular, the crime of
falsification of public document.  If
so, then the private respondents would have committed falsification because
they stated in paragraph 2 of the deed of sale they executed in favor of
Ricardo Silverio, that the real properties they sold were "free from all
liens and encumbrances" although a notice of <b>lis </b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pendens</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>is annotated at the back of the T.C.T. of one parcel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The meaning, nature, recording, and effects of a notice of <b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lis </span>pendens</b> are clearly stated in
the Revised Rules of Court, Rule 14, Section 24, thus:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 24.  Notice of <b>lis
pendens</b>.-- In an action affecting the title or the right of possession of
real property, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, and the
defendant, at the time of filing his answer, when affirmative relief is claimed
in such answer, or at any time afterwards, may record in the office of the
registrar of deeds of the province in which the property is situated a notice
of the pendency of the action, containing the names of the parties and the
object of the action or defense, and a description of the property in that
province affected thereby.  From the
time only of filing such notice for record shall a purchaser, or incumbrancer
of the property affected thereby, be deemed to have constructive notice of the
pendency of the action, and only of its pendency against parties designated by
their real names.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The notice of <b>lis pendens </b>here­inabove mentioned may be
cancelled only upon order of the court, after proper showing that notice is for
the purpose of molesting the adverse party, or that it is not necessary to
protect the rights of the party who caused it to be recorded.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>Lis </b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pendens</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>is a Latin term which literally means
a pending suit<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
or a pending litigation while a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">notice
of <b>lis pendens</b> </span>is an announcement to the whole world that a
particular real property is in litigation, serving as a warning that one who
acquires an interest over the said property does so at his own risk, or that he
gambles on the result of the litigation over the said property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It is but a signal to the intending buyer or mortgagee to take care or beware
and to investigate the prospect or non-prospect of the litigation succeeding before
he forks down his money.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notice of <b>Lis pendens</b> has been conceived and, more often
than not, availed of, to protect the real rights of the registrant while the
case involving such rights is pending resolution or decision.  With the notice of <b>lis pendens</b> duly
recorded, and remains uncancelled, he could rest secure that he would not lose
the property or any part of it during the litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">"[T]he doctrine of <b>lis pendens</b> is founded upon reason
of public policy and necessity, the purpose of which is to keep the subject
matter of the litigation within the power of the Court until the judgment or
the decree shall have been entered; otherwise, by successive alienations
pending the litigation, its judgment or decree shall be rendered abortive and
impossible of execution."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court is therefore correct in ruling that a notice of <b>lis
pendens</b> being a mere cautionary notice to a prospective buyer or mortgagee
of a parcel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>land under
litigation, then it imposes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">no </span>obligation
on the owner, but on the prospective buyer.  It cannot conceivably be the “lien or encumbrance” contemplated by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, a "lien" is a charge on property
usually for the payment of some debt or obligation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
A “lien” is a qualified right or a proprietary interest, which may be exercised
over the property of another.  It is a
right which the law gives to have a debt satisfied out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>a particular thing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> It
signifies a legal claim or charge on property, either real or personal, as a
collateral or security for the payment of some debt or obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, an "encumbrance is a burden upon land,
depreciative of its value, such as a lien, easement, or servitude, which,
though adverse to (the) interest of (the) landowner, does not conflict with his
conveyance of (the) land in fee."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following are considered encumbrances:  A claim, lien, charge, or liability attached
to and binding real property; e.g., a mortgage, judgment lien, lease, security
interest, easement or right of way, accrued and unpaid taxes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A lien is already an existing burden or
charge on the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">property </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">while </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a notice of <b>lis pendens</b>, as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the very<b> </b></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">term
connotes, is only a notice </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">warning that a claim or possible charge </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on the property is pending determination by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the effect of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">notice of <b>l</b></span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
pendens </span></b>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>to
establish an actual lien on the property affected.  All that it does is to give notice to third persons and to the
whole world that any interest they may acquire in the property pending
litigation will be subject to the eventuality or result of the suit.  It follows to reason, therefore, that the
mere failure to state in a public document, as a notarized deed of sale, the
existence of a notice of <b>lis pendens</b> does not constitute falsification
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>public document under
Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code.  This is specially true in the case at bar because the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">notice </span>of <b>lis pendens</b> is
annotated only at the back of the original of the T.C.T. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the Registry of Deeds; it does not
appear at the back of the owner's copy of the same T.C.T.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has taken the semantic stance that the notice of <b>lis
pendens</b> is not the lien or encumbrance charged in the information but that
it is merely an evidence of such litigation.  In sum, the petitioner claims that the status of being a litigated
property is the very lien or encumbrance that is charged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's sophistry stretches the legal meaning of lien
and encumbrance too far to be tenable.  Be that as it may, not all claims against a property can be considered a
lien within the contemplation of law.  First, such claims must be in satisfaction of some debt or performance
of an act under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>contract.  Second, the legal right to enforce such payment
or performance of an act be anchored on an existing or demandable obligation
and not merely dependent upon the result of a pending litigation where the
claims of the parties are not yet finally determined.  Such claims in a pending litigation only ripen to a
"lien" within the contemplation of law when there is already a valid
judgment rendered because then it becomes a judgment or judicial lien.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the property is contested or under litigation does
not necessarily give rise to the conclusion that the complainant or petitioner
has a better <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">legal </span>right than
the respondents so as to enable the former to enforce a lien thereon.  That is exactly the reason for a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">notice of <b>lis </b></span><b>pendens</b>--to
warn those who may subsequently deal with the property to take cognizance of
the conflicting rights between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">notice of <b>lis
</b></span><b>pendens</b>, or a pending litigation, or the fact that the
property is under litigation is not within the purview of what is legally
considered a lien or encumbrance.  The
term <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">notice of <b>lis pendens</b> </span>is
a distinct concept, as differentiated from the term lien or encumbrance.  The trial court, therefore, committed no
reversible error in granting the private respondents' Motion to Quash, and
thereby dismissing the information against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised by the Solicitor General and the private
respondents that there is a patent lack of authority on the private prosecution
to file this petition or even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>move
for reconsideration of the lower court's order granting the Motion to Quash is
well-taken.  But there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span>no need to dwell on that point
further considering that the foregoing disquisition, without more, sufficiently
disposes of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error committed by
respondent court, the petition is hereby DISMISSED, and the two challenged
orders:  dated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">July </span>17, 1987 and August 26, 1987, are AFFIRMED.</p>

<p class="BODY">Costs against the petitioner.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
