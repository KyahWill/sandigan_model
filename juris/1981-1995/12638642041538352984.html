would be returned on the same day, <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>
acquiesced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of the same
day, <span class="SpellE">Genese</span> did return the amount but in the form of
a check.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">check,
together with all the other tax collections of the city government were</span>
deposited with the Philippine National Bank (PNB).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, when the PNB presented the check for
payment, the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank, Manila Banking Corporation
(<span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>), dishonored it.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few months earlier, on December 17, 1982, petitioner Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., employed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>a

CARLED in favor of <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>, which were to be
registered with the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was also given three checks, one

the transfer tax due from CARLED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1983</st1:date>, petitioner returned
the documents to the bank on the pretext that the tasks assigned him have been
accomplished.</p>

dishonor and the corresponding debit of its account in PNB in the amount of

bank's Loan and Discount Department and transmitted to the Legal Department for
registration by petitioner de la <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the bank took charge of the

and to pay the corresponding tax, expenses and other fees using the three (3)
cashier's checks prepared separately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, petitioner was not able to transact business immediately
because of the heavy volume of transactions in the register of deeds of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> and the long line of people
awaiting their turn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner left the

has some problems in the registration and he told Peter that he finds it
difficult to register because of too many people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Peter offered his assistance and petitioner
in his honest desire to facilitate the registration agreed considering that Peter
already helped him in previous registration assignments.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

certain circumstances which, taken together, inevitably point to petitioner's
guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner has been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>registration clerk of <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>
for twelve years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him he
was not authorized nor was he in the habit of delegating his functions to
others [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1985</st1:date>,
p. 31.] Yet in seeking to exculpate himself he testified that he entrusted the
check in question together with some other documents to a certain Peter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The check involved was in the amount of P26<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides the
said check, the following documents given by <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>
to petitioner were allegedly entrusted by the latter to Peter:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) a deed of sale of a real estate in favor
of CARLED the consideration of which was P10,500,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

(c) two <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span> checks one for P95,000.00 and the
other P44,141.50.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the
importance of these documents and the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>petitioner's own statement that he does
not delegate his duties to others, the Court rejects petitioner's story that he
entrusted them to Peter, an acquaintance whose surname and residence petitioner
does not even know.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioner, the long lines at the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Register of Deeds and at the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Treasurer's Office forced him to give the documents and checks to Peter to
facilitate the registration of the deed of sale and mortgage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>well as the payment of the transfer
tax [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1985</st1:date>,
p. 6.]<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>Yet while the documents
were given to petitioner on December 17, 1983, it wasn't until 18 days later,
on January 4, 1984, that petitioner returned the said documents to the bank
thus negating his alleged intention of rushing the tasks assigned him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner reported to the legal department on <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1984</st1:date> to having registered
the sale and mortgage and paid the transfer tax by returning certain documents,
which on close examination belie his claim of having accomplished his errands
and indicate further his culpability in the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First of all, petitioner did not submit an
official receipt of the payment of the transfer tax or any evidence that it has
been paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, the real estate
mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "K") which petitioner
claimed to have registered with the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Register
of Deeds bore a printed certification of registration by the register of deeds
not of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
but of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the printed certification of registration,
the phrase "<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>"
appears twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of them was crossed
out by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>pen
and below it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was
</span>handwritten the word "<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>".
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The registration is therefore patently
spurious not only because of the said alteration but also because the property
subject matter of the mortgage is located in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the long experience of petitioner
as a registration clerk and considering further that when petitioner returned
the documents to the bank on <st1:date year="1983" day="4" month="1">January 4,
 1983</st1:date>, he reported having accomplished his tasks, the Court will not
now allow him to feign ignorance of the patently irregular registration of the
mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The non-registration of the
mortgage confirms the non-payment of the transfer tax, for which the check <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>question
[<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "C"] was meant, since <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>admitted
by petitioner himself based on his experience as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>registration clerk, the mortgage will not be registered by the
Register of Deeds unless there is proof that the transfer tax has been paid
[TSN, November 28, 1985, p. 33.] Therefore, the effort to make <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the mortgage appear as having been registered
as described above reveals petitioner's attempt to cover up the non-payment of
the transfer tax and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ties with some employees of the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Quezon</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court next finds significant the fact that the duplicate
copies of the check which were kept by the loans and discount department of <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span> were similarly altered as to the original, the
payee having been changed from "Municipal Treasurer of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>" to "Municipal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Treasurer of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Quezon</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">." While it is true, as contended by
petitioner that the duplicate copies were never handed to him but were kept by
a custodian, a Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bunoan</span> of the loans and discount
department, petitioner nevertheless admitted to having called up said
department to have the payee changed from "Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>" to "Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City" </span>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the payment of the transfer tax and the registration of the different documents

with petitioner's claim of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">innocence
regarding the alteration of the check and consequently, fatal to his cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also finds relevant the fact that petitioner made a
deposit of P26<span class="GramE">,250.00</span> to <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>
during the investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deposit
was made upon instruction by <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span> to answer for
the damage caused by the altered check to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Treasury should the latter, through PNB, seek recovery from <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner contends that his making of the deposit notwithstanding his
lack of the necessary funds [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1985</st1:date>, p. 19] shows his innocence, sincerity and good faith
[Petition, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 10.] But his eagerness to
show his innocence to the bank investigators and willingness to shoulder the
damage caused by the alteration of the check, rather than support his claim of
innocence, further strengthen the other circumstantial evidence pointing to
petitioner's guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered that petitioner was given exclusive
possession of the check by <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That it should turn up in the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Treasurer's Office, where petitioner has
admitted to having made several acquaintances [TSN, November 28, 1985, p. 22]
because of the transactions he has made therein in the many years that he has
been a registration clerk of <span class="SpellE">Manilabank</span>, has not been
credibly explained by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's
story about Peter, the "fixer" is unsupported by any evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

petitioner alleged that the purpose in giving the check and other documents to
Peter was to rush the payment of the transfer tax and the registration of the
sale and mortgage but this was negated by the fact that the petitioner reported
having accomplished his tasks eighteen days after they were assigned by the
bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances, having been
proved with certainty by clear and convincing evidence, are, together with the
inherent weakness of the defense of such nature that an analysis and combination
