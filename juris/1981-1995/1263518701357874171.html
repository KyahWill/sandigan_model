				G.R. No. 55831, May 30, 1983</h4>

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Gilbert Medrano complains that in this Court's decision of May 31, 1982, he was erroneously included as an appellant together with his three co-accused when in truth he did not appeal. Only his three co-accused appealed. Medrano's grievance is justified. Through clerical misprision, he was regarded as an appellant. (People <em>vs</em>. Medrano, et al., 114 SCRA 335). <p>Not having appealed, this Court did not have jurisdiction over his case. The sentence against him is void being <em>coram non judice</em>&nbsp; and may be attacked anytime. The dispositive part of the decision is hereby amended as follows by deleting any reference to Medrano:</p> <blockquote> <p>"WHEREFORE, the penalty imposed on Marcelo Arzadon is affirmed. As accomplices, Edilberto Arzadon and Antonio Poblete are sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of ten years of <em>prision mayor medium</em> as minimum to fourteen years of <em>reclusion temporal</em> minimum as maximum and, as their quota, they are ordered to pay solidarily to the heirs of the victim an indemnity of six thousand pesos. Costs <em>de oficio</em>."</p></blockquote> <p>Valid and enforceable against Medrano is the sentence imposed by the trial court which he has started to serve and which is an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em> as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <em>reclusion temporal</em> as maximum with credit for his preventive imprisonment.</p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p> <p><em>Makasiar, Concepcion Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro</em> and <em>Escolin, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
