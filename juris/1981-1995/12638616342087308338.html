				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
and/or appeal by <i>certiorari</i> assails the appellate court's ruling that <i>mandamus</i>
lies to compel the reinstatement of a quarry superintendent in the provincial
government of Laguna who was initially detailed or transferred to another
office, then suspended, and finally dismissed following his expose of certain
anomalies and irregularities committed by government employees in the province.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts, as narrated by the respondent Court of
Appeals are:</p>

<blockquote>Records show that at all pertinent times, petitioner-appellant
(private respondent herein) had been the quarry superintendent in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Laguna</st1:placename></st1:place> since his appointment as
such on <st1:date year="1959" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In April and May of 1973,
petitioner-appellant denounced graft and corrupt practices by employees of the
provincial government of Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the development of events may be briefly encapsulated as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1973</st1:date>, herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> provincial governor (one of the petitioners
herein) issued Office Order No. 72 transferring <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>
to the office of the Provincial Engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An <u>amended</u> office order invoked LOI 14-B for said transfer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>
challenged said transfer, and on <st1:date year="1973" day="25" month="10">October
 25, 1973</st1:date>, the Civil Service Commission ruled the same <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 32, RA 2260, and ordered that <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> be reverted to his regular position of quarry
superintendent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>c. On <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1973</st1:date>,
instead of complying with the CSC directive that <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>
be reverted to his regular position, herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
provincial governor suspended <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> for alleged
gross discourtesy, inefficiency and insubordination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On that basis, reconsideration of the CSC
directive that <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> be reverted to the position of
quarry superintendent was sought as academic (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>d.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1974</st1:date>, the Civil Service Commission
reiterated its <st1:date year="1973" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1973</st1:date>
directive for the immediate reversion of <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> to
his former position, and ruled the one-year suspension illegal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>e.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> provincial governor appealed to the Office of the
President from the CSC rulings alluded to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>f.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1974</st1:date>, there issued OP Decision 954,
Series of 1974 reversing the CSC rulings without prejudice to the decision of
the Local Review Board [which had in fact already sustained the one-year
suspension under date of <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1974</st1:date>].</blockquote>

<blockquote>g.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On petitioner-appellant's
motion for reconsideration, the Office of the President rendered OP Decision
1834, Series of 1976, dated <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="5">May 19,
 1976</st1:date>, setting aside OP Decision 954, declaring the one-year
suspension improper, and ordering payment of back salaries to <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>h.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent-appellant
moved for reconsideration of OP Decision 1834 on <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
said motion for reconsiÂ­deration was denied on <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1978</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">i</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the interim, respondent?appellant provincial governor issued an
Order of <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1977</st1:date>
dismissing <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> for alleged neglect of duty,
frequent unauthorized absences, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of
duty and abandonment of office, which order of dismissal was appealed by <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> to the Civil Service Commission on <st1:date year="1977" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1977</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>j.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1979</st1:date>, the Civil Service Commission
resolved said appeal by declaring the dismissal unjustified, exonerating <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> of charges, and directing his reinstatement as
quarry superintendent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>k.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1979</st1:date>, respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
provincial governor sought relief from the CSC decision of <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1979</st1:date> declaring <span class="SpellE">Berroya's</span>
dismissal unjustified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>l.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1979</st1:date>, the CSC Merit System Board
denied said motion for reconsideration in its Resolution No. 567.</blockquote>

<blockquote>m. Thereafter, respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
provincial governor moved anew to set aside OP Decision 1834, Series of 1976 -
the first motion for reconsideration of which had been denied on <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(ref. #h, supra).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Office of the President dismissed said
motion on <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1981</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioner-appellant's formal demand for reinstatement to the
position of quarry superintendent having been disdained despite the factual
antecedents <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, he filed, [on <st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1980</st1:date>] the antecedent Civil
Case No. SC-1834 for <i>mandamus</i> to compel his reversion to the position of
quarry superintendent at the <span class="SpellE">Oogong</span> Quarry, with back
salaries for the entire period of his suspension and dismissal (exclusive of
leaves of absence with pay), and prayed for moral and exemplary damages,
attorney's fees and expenses of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> moved to dismiss
said petition for <i>mandamus</i>, as amended, and opposed the therein
application for preliminary injunctive relief for immediate reinstatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In an Order of <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="12">December 1,
 1980</st1:date>, the trial court denied the application for preliminary
injunctive relief "until after the parties shall have adduced evidence,
pro and con, the grant of injunctive relief", and similarly deferred its
resolution on the motion to dismiss "for lack of merit for the present x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> until after the trial."</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1980</st1:date>,
respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> answered the petition for <i>mandamus</i>
and prayed that judgment be rendered -</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the Complaint
and denying the prayer for Preliminary Injunction;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Declaring petitioner to
have been legally separated or dismissed from the government service;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ordering petitioner to
pay each of them the sum of P200,000.00 by way of moral damages; P100,000.00 as
exemplary damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees plus P300.00 each per court
appearance; other litigation expenses which may be incurred as may be proved in
due course; and to pay the costs of suit [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
35-37.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the civil case
for <i>mandamus</i>, on <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1981</st1:date>
petitioner provincial governor filed a petition for relief from O.P. Decision
1834 with the Office of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
was denied on <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1984</st1:date>
on the ground that only one motion for reconsideration of O.P. Decision 1834
was allowed, the petition for relief being the third such motion filed by
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1985</st1:date>,
after trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered its decision finding the
transfer of petitioner?appellant from his position of quarry
superintendent to the office of the Provincial Engineer sufficiently
warranted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, his one-year
suspension was found to be proper under LOI 14-B and unassailable upon
affirmation by the Local Review Board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His summary dismissal was likewise found to be a justified exercise of
the authority granted under LOI 14-B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial Court further decided "that none of the respondents
should be held personally liable in their private capacity to the petitioner
because their actuations are not at all tainted with malice and bad faith"
[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 38.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>However, although the
trial court upheld the validity of <span class="SpellE">Berroya's</span>
dismissal, it nevertheless ordered his reinstatement to an equivalent position
as a matter of equity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of its decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ordering respondents to
reinstate petitioner to any position equivalent to that of a quarry superintendent
which has been abolished in the present <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> of
the provincial government of Laguna as reorganized pursuant to PD 1136 without
diminution in rank and salary;</blockquote>

as soon as this decision becomes final;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1985</st1:date>,
herein private respondent <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> appealed from the

states:</p>

position of quarry superintendent of the <span class="SpellE">Oogong</span>
Quarry in Laguna or to the position which said office may now be called

the issue of legality of the order of suspension by petitioner Governor dated <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1973</st1:date> had already been
passed upon in a decision of the Office of the President (O.P. Decision No.

ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is not disputed that the Governor, in issuing his Order of
Suspension, was exercising an authority legally endowed upon (sic) him by LOI
14-B, but it must not be an unbridled exercise of such authority.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A review of the records discloses that the only act of the governor
which was sustained by the Local Review Board was his imposing the suspension
on <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> for alleged discourtesy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Office is prone to adopt a contrary
stand on the matter taking into consideration the circumstances leading to the
writing of the so-called "dishonest" statements of the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unfortunate that the
Local Review Board took it as an infraction of the Civil Service Rules and
Regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be observed that
the said statements were made in the course of a pending case before the Civil
Service Commission, and in defense of the position of the petitioner. Although
the said statements, by themselves, may be considered as lacking in refinement,
still this fact alone does not justify the drastic action taken against the
petitioner in this case. â¦</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of the foregoing, this Office rules that the suspension
order was unjustified. Considering that respondent <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>
has already served the suspension order and that his suspension was not proper,
it is hereby ordered that he be entitled to the payment of his back salaries
corresponding to the period of his suspension [Folder of Exhibits, Vol. 1, pp.

170.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On July 3, 1979, petitioner
governor filed a second petition to reconsider O.P. Decision No. 1834 on the
main ground that the disputed decision is null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> allegedly because <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>
filed his motion for reconsideration of O.P. Decision No. 954 only on July 15,
1975 or after a lapse of one year and forty seven (47) days from the date when
the said decision was rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Office of the President denied such petition in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1981</st1:date> [Folder of Exhibits,
Vol. 1, p. 210] on the strength of Executive Order No. 19, Series of 1966 which
empowers said office to act upon petitions for reconsideration, even if filed
late, in exceptionally meritorious cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said Office further pointed out that upon review of the records of the
case, it was shown that <span class="SpellE">Berroya's</span> motion for
reconsideration was filed on July 15, 1974 and not on July 15, 1975 as
erroneously indicated in O.P. Decision No. 1834 [Folder of Exhibits, Vol. 1, p.
213.]</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it can be seen that O.P. Decision No. 1834
had already attained finality upon denial of the first motion for reconsideration
in view of the clear provisions of the applicable law at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Executive Order No. 19, Series of 1966, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitions for
reconsideration filed after the lapse of the aforesaid period (fifteen days

<u>b</u>y <u>any</u> <u>party</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>allowed</u>
[Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the filing of the second petition for
reconsideration could not have stayed the finality of the aforesaid decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a last ditch attempt to assail the validity of O.P. Decision
No. 1834, a petition for relief was filed by herein petitioners on <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1981</st1:date>, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the <i>mandamus</i> case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This petition was finally denied in a
resolution of the office dated <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">B. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, the
validity of <span class="SpellE">Berroya's</span> dismissal was already passed
upon by the Merit Systems Board of the Civil Service Commission in MSB Case No.
40.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1979</st1:date>, the Merit Systems
Board held as follows:</p>

<blockquote>After carefully perusing the records of this case, this board is
convinced that there is no strong evidence of guilt against <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there is not even sufficient
evidence to maintain the charges against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the same does not fall within the scope of Section 40,
Presidential Decree No. 807.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The record does not show that <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> is
notoriously undesirable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, his performance ratings from the period ending <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1969</st1:date> to the period ending <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1973</st1:date> are all very
satisfactory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, he is
not notoriously undesirable under the standard laid down by the President, to
wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"the test of being notoriously
undesirable is two-fold:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether it is
common knowledge or generally known as universally believed to be true or
manifest to the world that petitioner committed the acts imputed against him,
and whether he had contracted the habit for any of the enumerated
misdemeanors".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same are not
present in the case of <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary he should be given
recognition for his efforts in exposing the irregularities allegedly committed
by some authorities of the Laguna Provincial Government which led to the filing
of criminal as well as administrative cases against such officials.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Foregoing premises considered, this Board finds the order of
dismissal dated <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1977</st1:date>,
without justifiable basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore,
the Board hereby exonerates <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. Mariano <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>, Jr. of the charges against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is hereby directed that he
be reinstated to his position as Quarry Superintendent of Laguna
immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Folder of Exhibits, Vol.
1, pp. 175-176.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration from this decision was denied in a
resolution of the Board dated <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1979</st1:date>. This decision was therefore already final when <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> instituted suit in 1980 to compel petitioner to
reinstate him to his former position and to pay his back salaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the decisions of both the Civil Service Commission and the
Office of the President had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
the same can no longer be reviewed by the courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-established in our jurisprudence
that the decisions and orders of administrative agencies, rendered pursuant to
their quasi-judicial authority, have upon their finality, the force and binding
effect of a final judgment within the purview of the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> [<span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> v. Castro, 99 Phil. 497 (1956), <span class="SpellE">Ipekdjian</span> Merchandising Co., Inc. v. Court of Tax Appeals,
G.R. No. L-15430, <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1963</st1:date>,
9 SCRA 72.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u style="text-underline:
words">judicata</u></span> which forbids the reopening of a matter once
judicially determined by competent authority applies as well to the judicial
and quasi-judicial acts of public, executive or administrative officers and
boards acting within their jurisdiction as to the judgments of courts having
general judicial powers [<span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> v. Castro, <u>supra</u>
at 503.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the principle of conclusiveness of prior adjudications is
not confined in its operation to the judgments of what are ordinarily known as
courts, but it extends to all bodies upon whom judicial powers had been
conferred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, whenever any board,
tribunal or person is by law vested with authority to judicially determine a
question, like the Merit Systems Board of the Civil Service Commission and the
Office of the President, for instance, such determination, when it has become
final, is as conclusive between the same parties litigating for the same cause
as though the adjudication had been made by a court of general jurisdiction [<span class="SpellE">Ipekdjian</span> Merchandising Co., Inc. v. Court of Tax Appeals, <u>supra</u>
at 76.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the trial court's act of reviewing and setting aside
the findings of the two administrative bodies was in gross disregard of the
basic legal precept that accords finality to administrative findings of facts.</p>

<blockquote>The general rule, under the principles of administrative law in
force in this jurisdiction, is that decisions of administrative officers shall
not be disturbed by the courts, except when the former have acted without or in
excess of their jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Findings of administrative officials and
agencies who have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to
specific matters are generally accorded not only respect but at times even
finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>. . . [<span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay
Logging Co., Inc. v. Lopez <span class="SpellE">Enage</span>, G.R. No. L-30637, <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1987</st1:date>, 152 SCRA 80.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Court cannot ignore the undisputed fact that the
decisions rendered by the Office of the President and the Merit Systems Board
had attained finality without petitioners having taken any timely legal
recourse to have the said decisions reviewed by the courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>,
in order to enforce his right to reinstatement and to back salaries pursuant to
these final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> administrative rulings,
instituted a suit for <i>mandamus</i> to compel petitioners to comply with the
directives issued by the two administrative agencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since private respondent <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> had
established his clear legal right to reinstatement and back salaries under the
aforementioned final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> administrative
decisions, it became a clear ministerial duty on the part of the authorities
concerned to comply with the orders contained in said decisions [<span class="SpellE">Tanala</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, G.R. No.
L-22537, <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>, 13
SCRA 566 at 574-575.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The established rule is that a writ of <i>mandamus</i> lies to
enforce a ministerial duty or "the performance of an act which the law
specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from office, trust or station"
[Section 3, Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Mohamad</span> Ali <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, <u>et</u>
<u>al.</u>, G.R. No. L-21905, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1966</st1:date>, 16 SCRA 599.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this case, the appropriate administrative agencies having determined with
finality that <span class="SpellE">Berroya's</span> suspension and dismissal were
without just cause, his reinstatement becomes a plain ministerial duty of the
petitioner Provincial Governor, a duty whose performance may be controlled and
enjoined by <i>mandamus</i> [<span class="SpellE">Ynchausti</span> and Co. v.
Wright, 47 Phil. 866 (1925); Tee and Co. v. Wright, 53 Phil. 194 (1929); <span class="SpellE">Gementiza</span> v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos.

154 SCRA 377.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this Tribunal upholds the appellate court's judgment for
the reinstatement of respondent <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> and payment
of his back salaries corresponding to the period of suspension and of illegal
dismissal from service, exclusive of that corresponding to leaves of absences
with pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as respondent <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> can no longer be reinstated because he has already
reached the compulsory retirement age of sixty five years on December 7, 1986<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The same does not hold
true for petitioner provincial governor who was found by the appellate court to

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that when a public officer goes beyond the

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <u>Mendoza</u> <u>v.</u> <u>De</u> <u>Leon</u> [33 Phil.

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, applying the principle that a public officer, by

Court holds that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> T. San Luis,
the Provincial Governor of Laguna who has been sued both in his official and

for the consequences of his illegal and wrongful acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, the Court sustains the appellate court's finding
that petitioner San Luis must be held liable to <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>

apart from the back salaries legally due him [<span class="SpellE">Rama</span> v.

</span>The appellate court was clearly warranted in awarding moral damages in

of petitioner Governor who arbitrarily and without legal justification refused <span class="SpellE">Berroya's</span> reinstatement in defiance of directives of the
administrative agencies with final authority on the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellate court that the
sum of P50,000.00 for moral damages is a reasonable award considering the
mental anguish and serious anxiety suffered by <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span>
as a result of the wrongful acts of petitioner Governor in refusing to
reinstate him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as correctly adjudged by respondent court, petitioner
San Luis must likewise answer to <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> for
attorney's fees plus costs and expenses of suit, which have been fixed by said
