petitioners refused to pay; and 4) he has also completed 60% of Phase II which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">costs P1,000,000.00 but petitioners, who have

received a copy of the resolution.  He
asked the trial court for a ten (10) day extension from April 26, 1991, within
which to file a motion for reconsideration.  Instead of ten (10) days, the trial court granted him twenty (20) days,

<p class="BODY">In the trial court’s order dated September 3, 1991, it denied due

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioners then filed a

execution; and <i>mandamus</i> to compel the trial court to give due course to
the appeal interposed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On December 6, 1991, the
respondent court denied </span>the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
rationalizing, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The petition cannot prosper.  In the first place, the rule enunciated in the en banc resolution of the
Supreme Court, promulgated on May 30, 1986, proscribes the filing of a motion
for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration either with the
Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Courts, Regional Trial Courts, or this
Court.  [See <u>Bayaca vs. Intermediate
Appellate Court</u>, No. L-74824, 144 SCRA 161, 163 (1986) citing <u>Habaluyas
Enterprises, Inc. vs. Japzon</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">No. </span>L-70895,
138 SCRA 46, 48 (1985)].  In the case at
bar the filing of such a (sic) motion for extension by Pangasinan did not
interrupt the period of appeal.  Thus,
as of May 16 (sic), 1991, i.e., the last day within which Pangasinan should
have filed its motion for reconsideration, the summary partial judgment in
question became final and executory.  The fact that Pangasinan filed its motion for extension of time to file
a motion for reconsideration on that day was of no moment since, for the reason
already stated above, such motion for extension was void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, even on the assumption that the final resolution
sought to be appealed from or, to be enforced, is a partial judgment where
multiple appeals are allowed and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>period
of appeal is 30 days as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">pro</span>vided
for in Sec. 19(b) of the Interim Rules promulgated on January 11, 1983 by the
Supreme Court, still the partial judgment in question had also become final and
executory at the time the notice of appeal was filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">for failure of Pangasinan to file its record on appeal as required by the
aforesaid provisions of the Interim Rules.  Thus, without a record on appeal, it is as though no appeal had been
taken from such judgment at all."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 19, 1991, petitioners filed an urgent motion for
reconsideration based on the ground that the trial court’s resolution dated
April 24, 1991 is merely interlocutory, citing the case of Guevarra, et al. v.
Court of Appeals, et al.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> They
elucidated that this ground was the subject of their <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">addendum</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>dated
December 11, 1991, which unknown to them, was prepared and filed after the
decision of the respondent court was rendered.  They, therefore prayed, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">inter
alia</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>that the
respondent court reconsider its decision and render another confirming that the
April 24, 1991 resolution of the trial court is interlocutory and declaring
void the writ of execution and order of garnishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 18, 1992, the motion for reconsideration was denied
after the respondent court found "no cogent reason to change, modify
and/or otherwise reverse the decision considering that not only does the motion
reiterate the same arguments advanced before and does not present any matter
not already considered and resolved in the decision, but also the private
respondent’s opposition has successfully refuted petitioners’ arguments in said
motion."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition, wherein petitioners again invoke Our
ruling in <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Guevarra, et al. v. </span>Court

<p class="BODY">Petitioners are correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">We were categorical in the case of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Guevarra, </span>et al. v. </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Court
of Appeals, et al., supra</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>that
a partial summary judgment is merely interlocutory and not a final
judgment.  Its nature is specifically
provided for in Section 4 of Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.  Case not
fully adjudicated on motion.- If on motion under this rule, judgment is not
rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is
necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings
and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel shall ascertain what
material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts
are actually and in good faith controverted.  It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear
without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of
damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further
proceedings in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">action as are
just.  Upon the trial of the action the
facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be
conducted accordingly."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">What Rule 34 contemplates is that the
appeal from the partial summary judgment shall be taken together with the
judgment that may be rendered in the entire case after a trial is conducted on
the material facts on which a substantial controversy exists.  The trial court and the respondent court
erroneously relied on Section 5 of Rule 36 of the Rules of Court, which
pertains to judgments in general.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, inasmuch as a partial summary judgment does not finally
dispose of the action, execution thereof shall not issue, conformably with
Section 1 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.  The questioned decision and resolution of
the Court of Appeals are SET ASIDE.  The
trial court’s orders dated September 3, 10 and 30, 1991 are likewise SET ASIDE.</p>
