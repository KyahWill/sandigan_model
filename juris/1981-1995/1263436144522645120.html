				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and
Mandamus, with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction or Temporary Restraining
Order, under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Principally, the petition seeks to nullify the Order of the
Ombudsman dated January 7, 1992, directing the preventive suspension of
petitioners, Dr. Brigida S. Buenaseda, <span style="">Chief
of Hospital </span>III; Isabelo C. <span style="">Banez,
Jr., </span>Administrative Officer III; Conrado Rey Matias, Technical Assistant
to the Ch<span style="">ief </span>of Hospital; Cora
C. Solis, Accountant III; and Enya N. Lopez, Supply Officer III, all of the
National Center for Mental Health.  The
petition also asks for an order directing the Ombudsman to disqualify Director
Raul Arnaw and Investigator Amy de Villa-Rosero, of the Office of the
Ombudsman, from participation in the preliminary investigation <span style="">of </span>the charges against petitioner
(Rollo, pp. 2-17; Annexes to Petition, Rollo, pp. 19-21).</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned order was issued in connection with the
administrative complaint filed with the Ombudsman (OBM-ADM­-0-91-0151) by the
private respondents against the petitioners for violation of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petition, the said order was issued upon the
recommendation of Director Raul Arnaw and Investigator Amy de Villa-Rosero,
without affording petitioners the opportunity to controvert the charges filed
against them.  Petitioners had sought to
disqualify Director Arnaw and Investigator Villa-Rosero for manifest partiality
and bias (Rollo, pp. 4-15).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 10, 1992, this Court required respondents' Comment
on the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 14 and September 22, 1992, petitioners filed a
"Supplemental Petition (Rollo, pp. 124-130; Annexes to Supplemental
Petition; Rollo, pp. 140-163) and an "Urgent Supplemental
Manifestation" (Rollo, pp. 164-172; Annexes To Urgent Supplemental
Manifestation; Rollo, pp. 173-176), respectively, averring developments that
transpired after the filing of the petition and stressing the urgency for the
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 22, 1992, this Court "x x x Resolved to REQUIRE
the respondents to MAINTAIN in the meantime, the STATUS QUO pending filing of
comments by said respondents on the original supplemental manifestation"
(Rollo, p. 177).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 29, 1992, petitioners filed a motion to direct
respondent Secretary of Health to comply with the Resolution dated September
22, 1992 (Rollo, pp. 182-192, Annexes, pp. 192-203).  In a Resolution dated October 1, 1992, this Court required
respondent Secretary of Health to comment on the said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 29, 1992, in a pleading entitled "Omnibus
Submission," respondent NCMH Nurses Association submitted its Comment to
the Petition, Supplemental Petition and Urgent Supplemental Manifestation.  Included in said pleadings were the motions
to hold the lawyers of petitioners in contempt and to disbar them (Rollo, pp.
210­-267).  Attached to the "Omnibus
Submission" as annexes were the orders and pleadings filed in
Administrative Case No. OBM-ADM-0-91-0151 against petitioners (Rollo, pp.
268-480).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Motion for Disbarment
charges the lawyers of petitioners with:  (1) "unlawfully advising or otherwise causing or inducing their
clients - petitioners Buenaseda, et al., to openly defy, ignore, disregard,
disobey or otherwise violate, maliciously evade their preventive </span>suspension
by Order of July 7, 1992 of the Ombudsman x x x"; (2) "unlawfully
interfering with and obstructing the implementation of the said order (Omnibus
Submission, pp. 50-52; Rollo, pp. 259-260); and (3) violation of the Canons of
the Code of Professional Responsibility and of unprofessional and unethical
conduct "by foisting blatant lies, malicious falsehood and outrageous
deception" and by committing subornation <span style="">of </span>perjury, falsification and fabrication in their pleadings
(Omnibus Submission, <span style="">pp. </span>52-54;
Rollo, pp. 261-263).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 11, 1992, petitioners filed a "Manifestation and
Supplement to 'Motion to Direct Respondent Secretary of Health to Comply with
22 September 1992 Resolution'" (Manifestation attached to Rollo without
pagination between pp. 613 and 614 thereof).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 13, 1992, the Solicitor General submitted its Comment
dated November 10, 1992, alleging that:  (a) "despite the issuance of the September 22, 1992 Resolution
directing respondents to maintain the <u>status quo</u>, respondent Secretary
refuses to hold in abeyance the implementation of petitioners' preventive suspension;
(b) the clear intent and spirit of the Resolution dated September 22, 1992 is
to hold in abeyance the implementation of petitioners' preventive suspension,
the <u>status quo</u> obtaining the time of the filing of the instant petition;
(c) respondent Secretary's acts in refusing to hold in abeyance implementation
of petitioners' preventive suspension and in tolerating and approving the acts
of Dr. Abueva, the OIC appointed to replace petitioner Buenaseda, are in
violation of the Resolution dated September 22, 1992; and (d) therefore,
respondent Secretary should be directed to comply with the Resolution dated
September 22, 1992 immediately, by restoring the <u>status quo ante</u>
contemplated by the aforesaid resolution" (Comment attached to Rollo
without paginations between pp. 613-614 thereof).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Resolution dated November 26, 1992, this Court required
respondent Secretary to comply with the aforestated <u>status quo</u> order,
stating <u>inter alia</u>, that:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the <u>status quo ante litem motan</u>, or
the last peaceable uncontested status which preceded the present controversy
was the situation obtaining at the time of the filing of the petition at bar on
September 7, 1992 wherein petitioners were then actually occupying their
respective positions, the Court hereby ORDERS that petitioners be allowed to
perform the duties of their respective positions and to receive such salaries
and benefits as they may be lawfully entitled to, and that respondents and/or
any and all persons acting under their authority desist and refrain from
performing any act in violation of the aforementioned Resolution of September
22, 1992 until further orders from the Court" (Attached to Rollo after p.
615 thereof).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 9, 1992, the Solicitor General, commenting on the
Petition, Supplemental Petition and Supplemental Manifestation, stated
that:  (a) "The authority of the
Ombudsman is only to recommend suspension and he has no direct power to
suspend;" and (b) "Assuming the Ombudsman has the power to directly
suspend a government <span style="">official </span>or
employee, there are conditions required by law for the exercise of such powers;
[and] said conditions h<span style="">ave </span>not
been met in the instant case" (Attached to Rollo without pagination).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the pleading filed on January 25, 1993, petitioners adopted the
position of the Solicitor General that the Ombudsman can only suspend
government officials or employees connected with his office.  Petitioners also refuted private
respondents' motion to disbar petitioners' counsel and to cite them for
contempt (Attached to Rollo without pagination).</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue to resolve is whether the Ombudsman has the
power to suspend government officials and employees working in offices other
than the Office of the Ombudsman, pending the investigation of the
administrative complaints filed against said officials and employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In upholding the power of the Ombudsman to preventively suspend
petitioners, respondents (Urgent Motion to Lift Status Quo, etc, dated January
11, 1993, pp. 10-11), invoke Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 24.  Preventive
Suspension.  - The Ombudsman or his
Deputy may preventively suspend any officer or employee under his authority
pending an investigation, if in his judgment the evidence of guilt is strong,
and (a) the charge against such officer or employee involves dishonesty,
oppression or grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty; (b) the
charge would warrant removal from the service; or (c) the respondent's
continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The preventive suspension shall continue until the case <span style="">is </span>terminated by the Office of
Ombudsman but not more than six months, without pay, except when the delay in
the disposition of the case by the Office of the Ombudsman is due to the fault,
negligence or petition of the respondent, in which case the period of such
delay shall not be counted in computing the period of suspension herein
provided."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents argue that the power of preventive suspension given
the Ombudsman under Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770 was contemplated by Section 13
(8) of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, which provides that the Ombudsman
shall "exercise such other power or perform such functions or duties as
may be provided by law."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Solicitor General and the petitioners
claim that under the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman can only recommend to the
heads of the departments and other agencies the preventive suspension of
officials and employees facing administrative investigation conducted by his
office.  Hence, he cannot order the
preventive suspension himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">They invoke Section 13(3) of the 1987 Constitution which provides
that the Office of the Ombudsman shall have <u>inter alia</u> the power,
function, and duty to:</p>

<blockquote>"Direct the officer concerned to take appropriate action
against a public official or employee at fault, and recommend his removal,
suspension, demotion, fine, censure or prosecution, and ensure compliance
therewith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General argues that under said provision of the Constitution,
the Ombudsman has three distinct powers, namely:  (1) direct the officer concerned to take appropriate action
against public officials or employees at fault; (2) recommend their removal,
suspension, demotion fine, censure, or prosecution; and (3) compel compliance
with the recommendation (Comment dated December 3, 1992, pp. 9-10).</p>

<p class="BODY">The line of argument of the Solicitor General is a siren call
that can easily mislead, unless one bears in mind that what the Ombudsman
imposed on petitioners was not a punitive but only a preventive suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the Constitution vested on the Ombudsman the power "to
recommend the suspension" of a public official or employees (Sec. 13 [3]),
it referred to "suspension," as a punitive measure.  All the words associated with the word
"suspension" in said provision referred to penalties in
administrative cases, e.g. removal, demotion, fine, censure.  Under the rule of <u>Noscitor a sociis</u>,
the word "suspension" should be given the same sense as the other
words with which it is associated.  Where a particular word is equally susceptible of various meanings, its
correct construction may be made specific by considering the company of terms
in which it is found or with which it is associated (Co Kim Chan v. Valdez Tan
Keh, 75 Phil. 371 [1945]; Caltex (Phils.) Inc. v. Palomar, 18 SCRA 247 [1966]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, which grants the Ombudsman the power
to preventively suspend public officials and employees facing administrative
charges before him, is a procedural, not a penal statute.  The preventive suspension is imposed after
compliance with the requisites therein set forth, as an aid in the
investigation of the administrative <span style="">charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Constitution, the Ombudsman is expressly authorized to
recommend to the appropriate official the discipline or prosecution of erring
public officials or employees.  In order
to make an intelligent determination whether to recommend such actions, the
Ombudsman has to conduct an investigation.  In turn, in order for him to conduct such investigation in an
expeditious and efficient manner, he may need to suspend the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The need for the preventive suspension may arise from several
causes, among them, the danger of tampering or destruction of evidence in the
possession of respondent; the intimidation of witnesses, etc.  The Ombudsman should be given the discretion
to decide when the persons facing administrative charges should be preventively
suspended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Penal statutes are strictly construed while procedural statutes
are liberally construed (Crawford, Statutory Construction, Interpretation of
Laws, pp. 460-461; Lacson v. Romero, 92 Phil. 456 [1953]).  The test in determining if a <span style="">statute is penal is whether a penalty is
imposed for the punishment of a wrong to the public or for the redress of an
injury to an individual (59 Corpuz Juris, Sec. 658; Crawford, Statutory
Constructive, pp. 496-497).  A Code
prescribing the procedure in criminal cases is not a penal statute and is to be
interpreted liberally (People v. Adler, 140 N.Y. 331; 35 N.E. 644).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The purpose of R.A. No.
6770 is to give the Ombudsman such powers as he may need to perform efficiently
the task committed to him by the Constitution.  </span>Such being the case, said statute, particularly its provisions
dealing with procedure, should be given such interpretation that will
effectuate the purposes and objectives of the Constitution.  Any interpretation that will hamper the work
of the Ombudsman should be avoided.</p>

<p class="BODY">A statute granting powers to an agency created by the
Constitution should <span style="">be </span>liberally
construed for the advancement of the purposes and objectives for which it was
created (Cf. Department of Public Utilities v. Arkansas Louisiana Gas. Co., 200
Ark. 983, 142 S.W. (2d) 213 [1940]; Wallace v. Feehan, 206 Ind. 522, 190 N.E.,
438 [1934]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Nera v. Garcia</u>, 106 Phil. 1031 [1960], this Court,
holding that a preventive suspension is not a penalty, said:</p>

<blockquote>"Suspension is a preliminary step in an administrative
investigation.  If after such
investigation, the charges are established and the person investigated is found
guilty of acts warranting his removal, then he is removed or dismissed.  This is the penalty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To support his theory that the Ombudsman can only preventively
suspend respondents in administrative cases who are employed in his office, the
Solicitor General leans heavily on the phrase "suspend any officer or
employee under his authority" in Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770.</p>

<p class="BODY">The origin of the phrase can be traced to Section 694 of the
Revised Administrative Code, which dealt with preventive suspension and which
authorized the chief of a bureau or office to "suspend any subordinate or
employee in his bureau or under his authority pending an investigation x x
x."</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 34 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. No. 2266),
which superseded Section 694 of the Revised Administrative Code also authorized
the chief of a bureau or office to "suspend any subordinate officer or
employees, in his bureau or under his authority."</p>

<p class="BODY">However, when the power to discipline government officials and
employees was extended to the Civil Service Commission by the Civil Service Law
of 1975 (P.D. No. 805), concurrently with the President, the Department
Secretaries and the heads of bureaus and offices, the phrase "subordinate
officer and employee in his bureau" was deleted, appropriately leaving the
phrase "under his authority." Therefore, Section 41 of said law only
mentions that the proper disciplining authority may preventively suspend
"any subordinate officer or employee under his authority pending an
investigation x x x" (Sec. 41).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Administrative Code of 1987 also empowered the proper
disciplining authority to "preventively suspend any subordinate officer or
employee under his authority pending an investigation" (Sec. 51).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Ombudsman Law advisedly deleted the words
"subordinate" and "in his bureau," leaving the phrase to
read "suspend any officer or employee under his authority pending an
investigation x x x." The conclusion that can be deduced from the deletion
of the word "subordinate" before and the words "in his
bureau" after "officer or employee" is that the Congress
intended to empower the Ombudsman to preventively suspend all officials and
employees under investigation by his office, irrespective of whether they are employed
"in his office" or in other offices of the government.  The moment a criminal or administrative
complaint is filed with the Ombudsman, the respondent therein is deemed to be
"in his authority" and he can proceed to determine whether said
respondent should be placed under preventive suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their petition, petitioners also claim that the Ombudsman
committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when he
issued the suspension order without affording petitioners the opportunity to
confront the charges against them during the preliminary conference and even
after petitioners had asked for the disqualification of Director Arnaw and
Atty. Villa-Rosero (Rollo, pp. 6-13).  Joining petitioners, the Solicitor General contends that assuming <u>arguendo</u>
that the Ombudsman has the power to preventively suspend erring public
officials and employees who are working in other departments and offices, the
questioned order remains null and void for his failure to comply with the
requisites in Section 24 of the Ombudsman Law (Comment dated December 3, 1992,
pp. 11-19).</p>

<p class="BODY">Being a mere order for preventive suspension, the questioned
order of the Ombudsman was validly issued even without a full-blown hearing and
the formal presentation of evidence by the parties.  In <u>Nera</u>, <u>supra</u>, petitioner therein also claimed
that the Secretary of Health could not preventively suspend him before he could
file his answer to the administrative complaint.  The contention of petitioners herein can be dismissed
perfunctorily by holding that the suspension meted out was merely preventive
and therefore, as held in <u>Nera</u>, there was "nothing improper in
suspending an officer pending his investigation and before the charges against
him are heard x x x (Nera v. Garcia, <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that under Section <span style="">24 </span>of R.A. No. 6770, the Ombudsman cannot order the preventive
suspension of a respondent unless the evidence of guilt is strong and (1) the
charge against such officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or
grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty; (2) the charge would
warrant removal from the service; or <span style="">(3)
</span>the respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same conditions for the exercise of the power to preventively
suspend officials or employees under investigation were found in Section 34 of
R.A. No. 2260.</p>

<p class="BODY">The import of the <u>Nera</u> decision is that the disciplining
authority is given the discretion to decide when the evidence of guilt is
strong.  This fact is bolstered by
Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, which expressly left such determination of guilt
to the "judgment" of the Ombudsman on the basis of the administrative
complaint.  In the case at bench, the
Ombudsman issued the order of preventive suspension only after:  (a) petitioners had filed their answer to
the administrative complaint and the "Motion for the Preventive
Suspension" of petitioners, which incorporated the charges in the criminal
complaint against them (Annex 3, Omnibus Submission, Rollo, pp. 288-289; Annex
4, Rollo, pp. 290-296); (b) private respondent had filed a reply to the answer
of petitioners, specifying 23 cases of harassment by petitioners of the members
of private respondent (Annex 6, Omnibus Submission, Rollo, pp. 309?333);
and (c) a preliminary conference wherein the complainant and the respondents in
the administrative case agreed to submit their list of witnesses and
documentary <span style="">evidence.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners herein
submitted on November 7, 1991 their list </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">exhibits (Annex 8 of
Omnibus Submission, Rollo, pp. 336-337) while private respondents submitted
their list </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">exhibits (Annex 9 of Omnibus Submission,
Rollo, pp. 338-­348).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, it can not be said that Director Raul
Arnaw and Investigator Amy de Villa-Rosero acted with manifest partiality and
bias in recommending the suspension <span style="">of </span>petitioners.  Neither can it be said that the Ombudsman
had acted with grave abuse of discretion in acting favorably on their
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Motion for Contempt, which charges the lawyers of petitioners
with unlawfully causing or otherwise inducing their clients to openly defy and
disobey the preventive suspension as ordered by the Ombudsman and the Secretary
of Health can not prosper (Rollo, pp. 259-261).  The Motion should be filed, as in fact such a motion was <span style="">filed, </span>with the Ombudsman.  At any rate, we find that the acts alleged
to constitute indirect contempt were legitimate measures taken by said lawyers
to question the validity and propriety of the preventive suspension of their
clients.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, we take cognizance of the intemperate language
used by counsel for private respondents hurled against petitioners and their
counsel (Consolidated:  (1) Comment on
Private Respondent" "Urgent Motions, etc.,; (2) Adoption of OSG's
Comment; and (3) Reply to Private Respondent's Comment and Supplemental
Comment, pp. 4-5).</p>

<p class="BODY">A lawyer should not be carried away in espousing his client's
cause.  The language of a lawyer, both
oral or written, must be respectful and restrained in keeping with the dignity
of the legal profession and with his behavioral attitude toward his brethren in
the profession (Lubiano v. Gordolla, 115 SCRA 459 [1982]).  The use of abusive language by counsel
against the opposing counsel constitutes at the same time a disrespect to the
dignity of the court of justice.  Besides, the use of impassioned language in pleadings, more often than
not, creates more heat than light.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Motion for Disbarment (Rollo, p. 261) has no place in the
instant special civil action, which is confined to questions of jurisdiction or
abuse of discretion for the purpose of relieving persons from the arbitrary
acts of judges and quasi-judicial officers.  There is a set of procedure for the discipline of members of the bar
separate and apart from the present special civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED and the status quo
ordered to be maintained in the Resolution dated September 22, 1992 is LIFTED
and SET ASIDE.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BELLOSILLO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">I agree that the Ombudsman has the
authority, under Sec. 24 of R.A. No. 6770, to preventively suspend any
government official or employee administratively charged before him pending the
<span style="">investigation </span>of the complaint, the
reason being that respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the
prosecution of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in the case before us, I am afraid that the facts thus
far presented may not provide adequate basis to reasonably place petitioners
under preventive suspension.  For, it is
not enough to rule that the Ombudsman has authority to suspend petitioners
preventively while the case is in progress before him.  Equally important is the determination
whether it is necessary to issue the preventive suspension under the
circumstances.  Regretfully, I cannot
see any sufficient basis to justify the preventive suspension.  That is why, I go for granting oral argument
to the parties so that we can truthfully determine whether the preventive
suspension of respondents are warranted by the facts.  We may be suspending key government officials and employees on
the basis merely of speculations which may not serve the ends of justice but
which, on the other hand, deprive them of their right to due process.  The simultaneous preventive suspension of
top officials and employees of the National Center for Mental Health may just
disrupt the hospital's normal operations, much to the detriment of public
service.  We may safely assume that it
is not easy to replace them in their respective functions as those substituting
them may be taking over for the first time.  The proper care of mental patients may thus be unduly jeopardized and
their lives and limbs imperilled.</p>

<p class="BODY">I would be amenable to holding oral argument to hear the parties
if only to have enough factual and legal bases to justify the preventive
suspension of petitioners.</p>
