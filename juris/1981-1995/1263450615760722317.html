				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XIII, dated July 25,
1973, in Civil Case No. 88985, entitled "Great American Insurance Co.,
plaintiff, vs. Eastern &amp; Australian Steamship Co., Ltd. and/or <span class="SpellE">F.E</span>. <span class="SpellE">Zuellig</span>, Inc.,
defendants," the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, finding the
defendants liable to the plaintiff in the amount of $500.00, or its peso
equivalent of P3,217.50, with legal interest thereon from November 20, 1972;
and to further pay to the plaintiff an amount equivalent to twenty-five per
centum (25%) thereof by way of damages as and for attorney's <span style="">fees."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 10, 1971, the Jackson and Spring (Sydney) Pty. Ltd.
shipped from Sydney, Australia, one (1) case of impellers for <span class="SpellE">warman</span> pump on board the SS "<span class="SpellE">Chitral</span>,"
a vessel owned <span style="">and </span>operated in
the Philippines by Eastern &amp; Australian Steamship Co., Ltd., thru its agent
<span class="SpellE">F.E</span>. <span class="SpellE">Zuellig</span>, Inc. under
Bill of Lading No. 31, for delivery to Manila, Philippines in favor of
consignee <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shipment was insured with Great American
Insurance, Co. for P35,921.81 against all risks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1971</st1:date> the SS "<span class="SpellE">Chitral</span>" arrived
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> but failed to discharge
the shipment or any part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Demand
was made on herein petitioners for the delivery of said shipment, but having
failed to make delivery, a claim was presented against them for the value of
the ship­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, likewise,
failed to make good the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As a consequence of the loss of the shipment,
private respon­dent Great American Insurance Co. was compelled to pay the
consignee P35,921.81.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>, said private respondent filed a complaint dated </span><st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="11"><span style="">Nov.
 20, 1972</span></st1:date><span style=""> against
herein peti­tioners for recovery of the said amount with legal interest and
attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer dated Nov. 27, 1972 petitioners alleged that their
liability for the loss of the shipment is only limited to £100 Sterling or its
peso equivalent of P1,544.40 as per stipulation in the Bill of Lading and that
even before the filing of the complaint, petitioners have signified their
willingness to pay the claim up to their limit of liability as stipulated in
the Bill of Lading.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the pre-trial on May 28, 1973, the loss of the subject
shipment was admitted, and the parties submitted the case for decision on one
issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether petitioners' liabi­lity
is limited to £100 Sterling or its peso equivalent of P1,544.40 as stipulated
in Clause 17 of the Bill of Lading<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
or whether petitioners' liability should be $500 or its peso equivalent in the
sum of P3<span style="">, </span>217.50 pursuant to
Sec. 4 (5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">found that under
Section 4 (5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the carrier and the shipper
may, in the absence of a declaration in the Bill of Lading of the value of the
goods shipped, fix a maximum liability of the shipper for the cargo lost or
damaged, but such maximum shall not be less than $500.00 per package.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the agree­ment for a maximum
liability of only £100 </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Sterling</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> contained in Clause 17 of the Bill of Lading was declared void for
being contrary to law and as adverted to above, petitioners were held liable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the decision of the
lower court the present petition for review was instituted by petitioners
assigning the following errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote><span style="">THAT RESPONDENT CFI ERRED
IN DECIDING </span>THAT THE LIMIT OF LIABILITY IN THE SUM OF £100 STERLING OR
ITS PESO EQUIVALENT OF THE VESSEL/CARRIER, <span style="">PER </span>PACKAGE, <span style="">AS </span>STIPULATED
IN CLAUSE 17 OF THE BILL OF LADING, <span style="">IS
CON</span>TRARY <span style="">TO LAW, </span>AND,
THEREFORE, VOID; <span style="">and <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote><span style="">THAT RESPONDENT COURT ERRED
IN AWARDING </span>ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS IN FAVOR OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT AND
AGAINST THE HEREIN PETITIONERS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners contend that
the first paragraph of Section 4 (5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act
prescribes a maximum liability of the vessel/carrier in the amount of $500.00
per package; that said maximum liability, however, is not applicable in a
shipment wherein the nature and a higher valuation of the goods are indicated
in the Bill of Lading; that the second paragraph refers to an agreement of the
shipper and the carrier which provides for another maximum necessarily higher
than $500.00 and that said proviso should not be read in con­nection with
stipulations in Bills of Lading limiting the </span>vessel's <span style="">liability to less than $500.00 per package,
otherwise, the very intent of the law setting the sum of $500.00 as the maximum
liability of the carrier, per package, in the absence of a higher valuation of
the goods as indicated in the Bill of </span>Lading would be <span style="">nullified, for it would thereby become not
the maximum, but the minimum liability of the carrier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners also contend
that the New Civil Code, particularly Articles 1749</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and 1750,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> expressly allow the limitation of the </span><span style="">carrier's </span><span style="">liability, provided it is just and reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the limitation of petitioners'
liability to £100 </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Sterling</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> or its peso equivalent as stipulated in the Bill of Lading is
perfectly legal and binding to the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent alleges that Article 1749 imposes certain
conditions for the validity of a stipulation limiting the carrier's
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These conditions are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) it must be in writing, signed by the
shipper or owner; (2) it must be supported by a valuable consideration other
than the service rendered by the carrier; and (3) it must be reasonable, just
and not contrary to public policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent believes that an agreement limiting the carrier's
liability does not <u>per</u> <u>se</u> give validity thereto but it must be
shown, among others, that the amount agreed upon is just and reasonable under
the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no inconsistency between Section 4 (5) of the Carriage
of Goods by Sea Act and Clause 17 of the Bill of Lading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first part of the provision of Section 4
(5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act limits the maximum amount that may be
recovered by the shipper in the absence of an agreement as to the nature and
value of goods shipped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said provision
does not prescribe the minimum and hence, it could be any <span style="">amount which is below $500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clause 17 of the questioned Bill of Lading
also provides the maximum for which the carrier is liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It prescribes that the carrier may only be held
liable for an amount not more than £100 </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Sterling</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> which is below the maximum limit required in
the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that both the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and
Clause 17 of the Bill of Lading allow the payment beyond the respective maximum
limit imposed therein, provided that the value of the goods have been declared
in the Bill of Lading.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second paragraph of Section 4 (5) of the Carriage of Goods by
Sea Act prescribing the maximum amount shall not be less than $500.00 refers to
a situation where there is an agree­ment other than set forth in the Bill of
Lading providing for a maximum higher than $500.00 per package.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, it is apparent that there
had been no agreement between the parties, and hence, Clause 17 of the Bill of
Lading shall prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners' stand that
the condition imposed in Clause 17 of the Bill of Lading should not be read in
the light of second paragraph of Section 4 (5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea
Act, is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it would be
to render ineffective the very intent of the law setting the sum of $500.00 as
the maximum liability of the vessel/carrier, per package, in the absence of a
higher valuation of the goods as indicated in the Bill of Lading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By providing that $500.00 is the maximum lia­bility,
the law does not disallow an agreement for liability at a lesser amount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Significantly, Article
1749 of the New Civil Code expressly allows the limitation of the carrier's
liability:</p>

<blockquote>“Art. 1749. A stipulation that the common carrier's liability is
limited to the value of the goods appearing in the bill of lading, unless the
shipper or owner declares a greater value, is binding."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, in the case of
Northern Motors, Inc. vs. Prince Line,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This Court has held as valid and binding a similar provision
in a bill of lading limiting the carrier's liability to a specific amount
unless the shipper expressly declares a higher valuation and pays the
corresponding rate thereon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Again,
in Phoenix Assurance Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co.,
Inc.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We reiterated the validity of a stipulation
limiting the carrier's liability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The right of the carrier
to limit its liability has been recognized not only in Our jurisdiction but
also in American jurisprudence:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A stipulation in a contract of carriage that the carrier will
not be liable beyond a specified amount unless the shipper declares the goods
to have a greater value is generally deemed to be valid and will operate to
limit the carrier's liability, even if the loss or damage results from the
carrier's negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to such
provision, where the shipper is silent as to the value of his goods, the
carrier's liability for loss or damage thereto is limited to the amount
specified in the contract of carriage and where the shipper states the value of
his goods, the carrier's liability for loss or damage thereto is limited to
that amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under a stipulation such as
this, it is the duty of the shipper to disclose, rather than the carrier's to
demand the true value of the goods and silence on the part of the shipper will
be sufficient to limit recovery in case of loss to the amount stated in the
contract of carriage."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the above
findings, it is no longer necessary to discuss the second assignment of error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE, </b><span style="">the
decision of the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">is
hereby reversed and another one is entered finding petitioners liable to
private respondent in the amount of £100 </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Sterling</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> or its peso equivalent of P1,544.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Clause 17. - The carrier will not be accountable for goods of any description
beyond 100 Sterling in respect of any one package or unit unless the value thereof
shall have been stated in writing both on the broker's order, which must be
obtained before shipment, and on the shipping note presented on shipment, and
extra freight agreed upon and paid, and bill of lading signed with a
declaration of the nature and value of the goods appearing thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the value is declared and extra freight

goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package of lawful money of the United
States, or in case of goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight
