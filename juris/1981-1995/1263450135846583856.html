				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> and Angel San Andres were accused of
Murder (Criminal Case No. C-9146) which was committed according to the
information as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 24th day of August, 1977, in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Metro-Manila and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring together and mutually
<span style="">helping one another, without any
justifiable cause, with deliberate intent to kill and with treachery and
evident premeditation, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab with a bladed instrument at
the left chest one ARTURO C. PINEDA, thereby inflicting serious physical
injuries upon the latter, which injuries caused his death at the M. C. U. Hospital,
this city."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Angel San Andres was acquitted on <st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the meantime, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> on <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1979</st1:date>, with the assistance
of his counsel, withdrew his original plea of not guilty and substituted it
with a plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done
after the prosecution had presented its evidence and rested its case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So <span class="SpellE">Villar's</span> guilt
is not here in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact in his
brief, it is admitted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is no
doubt that appellant, who pleaded guilty is the perpetrator of the crime
charged." In a decision dated <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="3">March
 30, 1979</st1:date>,<span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> was sentenced as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused
FRANCISCO VILLAR guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime <span style="">of </span>MURDER without any aggravating or
mitigating circumstances and hereby sentences him to Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased victim in
the sum <span style="">of </span>Twelve Thousand
(P12,000.00) Pesos, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This appeal is based on a sole assignment of error:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT
CONSIDERING MINORITY OF APPELLANT AS PRIVILEGED MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE."</p>

<p class="BODY">After he had changed his plea to one of guilty, the trial court
permitted <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> to present evidence to prove his
claim of minority as a privileged mitigating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco, on the witness stand, admitted making the statement
quoted above but denied giving his age as <span style="">22
</span>years; he claimed that when the police asked about his age he said he
was born on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not Exhibit E was executed voluntarily by Francisco is
not in issue insofar as the determination of his age is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has pleaded guilty to the crime which <span style="">he </span>owned in Exhibit E and during the
hearing on his plea of minority he did not impugn said exhibit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he admitted its execution and his
only claim in relation thereto is that he did not give his age as 22 years but
instead gave his date of birth.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of the sole assignment of error we find as
well-taken and accordingly adopt as our own the lower court's ratiocination,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"After going over the evidence in support of the alleged
minority of the accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> when he
committed the crime on or about <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="8">August
 24, 1977</st1:date>, the Court finds that Exhibit 1 <span style="">and the testimonies of the defense witnesses can not have more
probative value than the written statement of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>,
Exhibit E.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that
Exhibit 1 is a delayed registration of a supposed birth accomplished and
submitted only on January 12, 1979 to the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City by the witness <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, long after the offense was committed and
after the prosecution finally rested its case on November 21, 1978, thus
exposing the basis of Exhibit 1 to be resting on a slender and shaky
foundation, and more so, in the absence of explanation from the defense of the
reason for said late registration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the Court rejects Exhibit 1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor could the testimonies of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
brother and sister be given credit it appearing from their own declaration that
the eldest of the two is only 18 years old and, therefore, could not have been
testifying on facts from their own personal knowledge, for obvious reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit E on the other hand, was duly signed
and sworn to by the accused on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="25" month="8"><span style="">August 25, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, a day after the commission of the offense,
at the time when the said accused has no opportunity to fabricate <span class="GramE">a deliberate falsehoods</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And considering that Exhibit E is replete with details reciting the true
sequence of events which can only be furnished by the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>-accused
who has experienced the same or taken part in the execution of the acts
narrated and may not be furnished by the investigators, the number of years (22
years old) stated by the accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> to
be his age on August 25, 1977, was given spontaneously and voluntarily."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant invokes Art. 410 of the Civil Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 410<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> books making up the civil register and all documents relating
thereto shall be considered public documents and shall be prima facie evidence
of the facts therein con<span style="">tained."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to say that the above-quoted provision makes the
information given in Exhibit 1 only <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> but not
conclusive evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so
because the Local Civil Registrar merely receives the information submitted to
him; he does not inquire into its veracity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, to regard as conclusive the content of <span style="">a certificate of live birth can lead to absurd results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supposing that <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
had given John F. Kennedy as the father of Francisco, are </span>we to accept
that as an incontestable fact?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
light of the circums<span style="">tances already
narrated concerning the preparation and submission of Exhibit 1, the lower
court committed no error in disregarding it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> finding no error to have been committed with
respect to the appealed judgment, the same is hereby affirmed in its
entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
