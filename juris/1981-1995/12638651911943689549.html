the house, the porch, the location of the chairs and benches.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She likewise indicated the exact place where

with her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She admitted, however,
that she did not actually see the two accused shoot her husband (TSN, July 6,
1972, pp. 38-46) and on <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> questions from
the court, she admitted that she did not actually see her husband going upstairs
to open the door of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
her son who told her about it just after the incident (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
53-54).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">On redirect examination,
witness <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> clarified that <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and <span class="SpellE">Terio</span> <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span> are one and the same person and<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>the other accused she was referring to was <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She clarified further that she saw only one
gun which was carried by <span class="SpellE">Terio</span> but accused <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> was not holding or carrying any firearm (TSN, July
17, 1972 pp. 52-53).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">The testimony of the widow
(<span class="SpellE">Caridad</span>) was fully corroborated on all material
points by her son, the eleven-year-old Melvin <span class="SpellE">Gabuat</span>,
who saw the shooting because he was following behind the victim, his
father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Melvin testified that he and his
father were already in the balcony and his father was opening the door of their
house when <span class="SpellE">Terio</span> pointed the gun at the latter and
shot him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His father was not able to do
anything except advise his son "<span class="SpellE">Agsingsingpet</span> ka
<span class="SpellE">barok</span>" which means be humble.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the two accused ran
southward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Melvin positively identified
in court the two accused, <span class="SpellE">Terio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> (TSN, July 10, 1972, pp. 27-34).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">On cross examination,
Melvin, like his mother admitted that there were two other persons who arrived
at their house besides the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
were <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Andring</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabael</span> but both of them
left earlier than the accused, and before the incident occurred (TSN, July 10,
1972, pp. 36-37).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">On questions from the
court, Melvin explained that he was immediately behind his father when the
latter pushed the door of the balcony and while his father was pushing the
door, he looked back and saw accused <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Terio</span> shoot his father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">From the testimony of the
witness, it can be gathered that the visit of the two accused was originally a
peaceful occasion, where his father and the two accused were sitting close
together while the latter were drinking wine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Melvin was sitting at the stairs where he was instructed by his mother
to stay and watch his father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
listening to their conversation about the merits of asbestos roofing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their voices were normal with no sign of
quarreling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, while the two
accused were conversing with his father, he noticed that <span class="SpellE">Terio</span>
had a gun, less than a meter in length, tucked at his waist with the barrel
protruding (TSN, July 10, 1972, pp. 43-51).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">The witness demonstrated
the relative positions of his father when he was shot and of the two accused
and stated that he was at a distance of two meters from his father when the
latter fell (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 51-52).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">More importantly, the testimonies
of both mother and son were fully corroborated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tacuboy</span>,
the Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Buguey</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> since 1960, who conducted in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tabbac</span>, a post-mortem examination on the body of the
deceased Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Gabuat</span> which he reduced in writing
and marked Exhibit "A", (Record, p. 2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His findings as stated in his medical certi­ficate
is that the victim suffered a "gunshot wound, through and through,
entrance wound 0.3 inch in diameter, with collar contusion, tissues <span class="SpellE">invaginated</span>, located at the mid portion of the right
scapular region, posterior portion of the body:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>exit wound 0.75 inch in diameter, tissues <span class="SpellE">everted</span>,
located at mid basal portion of the neck, anterior point:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>trajectory of the bullet from the back (right
scapular region) direct obliquely upwards, forward to the left."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">He confirmed that the
gunshot wound was caused by a rifle bullet and that the point of entry is at a
lower place than the point of exit, which means that judging from the location
of the entrance wound and the exit wound, the assailant at the time of the
commission of the crime was probably below or at a lower elevation than the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His finding that the
"trajectory of the bullet from the back (right scapular region) directed
obliquely upwards, forward to the left," in relation to the body of the
victim, means that the entrance of the wound was at the back scapular region
lower and it is directed obliquely upwards to the left because it is deflected
to the left side of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
possible, according to the witness, for the bullet prodding through the body of
the victim, to hit a specific bone causing the trajectory of the bullet to run
obliquely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In answer to questions of the
Court, witness clarified that if there had been a deflection, there could have
been a high velocity of the bullet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
probed the wound with a stick from the entrance to the exit and can say that
there is but a slight deflection by hitting the small bones at the side of the
vertebrae.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bullet which is a .30
caliber bullet of a rifle or <span class="SpellE">carbin</span> lodged on the
beam of the house where it was extracted by the police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">According to the witness,
the cause of the victim's death was shock and hemorrhage due to gunshot wound and
be could not have survived despite proper medical attention because death was
sudden (TSN, July 6, 1972, p. 4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">On question by the Court,
the witness further testified that the body of the victim was already inside
the room of the house when he first saw it; that when the victim was shot he
was facing east; that he was not going upstairs, otherwise the wound would be

‘concurrence of wills’ or ‘unity of action and purpose.’ The usual phraseology
employed in many of the later cases is ‘common and joint purpose and design.’
At times, reference is made to ‘previous concert of criminal design.’ Its
manifestation could be shown by ‘united and concerted action.’ Thus a
conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence; it may be deducted from the
mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conditions attending its commission and
the acts executed may be indicative of a common design to accomplish a criminal
purpose and objective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, to use the
apt words of Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, there is a ‘chain
of circumstances’ to that effect, then conspiracy has been established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If such be the case then, the act of one is

can be deduced from the above testimony of the sole eye-witness to the
perpetration of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
evidence of appellant's direct participation in the shooting of the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">Although no formal
agreement is necessary to establish conspiracy and said conspiracy may be
inferred from the circum­stances attending the commission of the crime, yet
conspiracy like any other ingredient of the offense, must he established by
clear and convincing evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
must be evidence of intentional participation in the transaction with a view to
the furtherance of the common design and purpose (People v. <span class="SpellE">Agda</span>,
111 SCRA 330 [1982]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same degree of
proof necessary to establish the crime is required to establish a finding of
criminal conspiracy, which is, proof beyond reasonable doubt (People v. <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>, Jr., 123 SCRA 72 [1983]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be esta­blished by conjectures but
by positive and conclusive evidence (People v. Martinez, 127 SCRA 260 [1984]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span> and appellant were
together when the crime was committed is not proof of the existence of
conspiracy to commit the crime (Francisco v. Court of Appeals, 122 SCRA 538
[1983]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere companionship does not
establish conspiracy (People v. <span class="SpellE">Sosing</span>, 111 SCRA 368
[1982]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">No conspiracy can be
deduced where the alleged co-conspirators did not perform any overt act of
shooting the victim although they were with the person who fired the gun
(People v. Benavidez, 127 SCRA 188 [1984]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case, it is undisputed that appellant did not perform any
overt act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">The only incriminating
evidence against appellant is that he was at the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere presence of appellant at the scene
of the crime at the time of its commission is not by itself, however,
sufficient to establish his criminal liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Existence of conspiracy must be clearly and convincingly proven (People
v. <span class="SpellE">Sabilano</span>, 132 SCRA 83 [1984]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused must be shown to have had guilty
participation in the criminal design entertained by the slayer, and this
presupposes knowledge on his part of such criminal design.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough that there be a relation
between the acts done by the principal or accomplice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is furthermore necessary that the latter,
with knowledge of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> criminal intent should
cooperate with moral or material aid in the consummation of the crime (People
v. <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>, Jr., <u>supra</u>; People v. Pimentel, 147
SCRA 25 [1987]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">Conspiracy between two
accused cannot be inferred by the mere fact that they have been drinking
together prior to the shooting and run away in the same direction thereafter;
more so where the other accused had no known motive to kill (People v. <span class="SpellE">Realon</span>, 99 SCRA 422 [1980]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the two accused left together
after the shooting incident does not show conspiracy (People v. De Jesus, 118
SCRA 616 [1982]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">Two circumstances which are
indicative of the innocence of the appellant and his earnest desire to prove
his innocence are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) his insistence
during the trial of the case in the lower court to testify and be placed on the
witness stand (TSN, August 25, 1972, pp. 149-150); and (b) when his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span> withdrew his
appeal, appellant pursued this appeal to the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-font-kerning:12.0pt">The incriminating evidence
against appellant <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span>

</span>Without conspiracy, he cannot be considered liable as he had no direct
participation in the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
