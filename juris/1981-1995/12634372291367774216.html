				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for certiorari seeks to review the decision dated
November 22, 1990 of the respondent, National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC), in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-12-05131-88 which reversed the decision dated
August 7, 1989 of the Labor Arbiter.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> owned and controlled three (3)
garment companies, namely Paramount Gloves <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.,
Inc., State Garment Company, and First General Marketing Corporation (FGMC). In
March, 1988, the <st1:city><st1:place>Paramount</st1:place></st1:city> and FGMC
were merged to enable <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> to meet the rising volume of
pur­chase orders and export demands.</p>

<p class="BODY">By agreement dated March 16, 1988 between Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and ANGLO (Alliance of Nationalist and Genuine Labor
Organizations), the workers of <st1:city><st1:place>Paramount</st1:place></st1:city>
were absorbed by FGMC. The private respondents, who were regular cutters at <st1:city><st1:place>Paramount</st1:place></st1:city>,
were assigned as "temporary trim­mers" in <span class="SpellE">FGMC's</span>
finishing section. Later, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> asked them to sign
probationary contracts with FGMC either as sewers or cutters, to exclude them
from the new compa­ny's bargaining unit.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1988</st1:date>,
they were discharged without notice. On <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1988</st1:date>, they filed a complaint against FGMC
and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> for illegal dismissal (NLRC NCR Case No.
00-12-05131-88).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 7, 1989, Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> rendered a decision dismissing the complaint
on the ground that when the complainants were required to work with respondent
FGMC as temporary trimmers, they knew that their hiring was seasonal in
character, hence, it could not ripen into permanent or regular employment.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the NLRC, the Commission on <st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1990</st1:date>, reversed the Labor Arbiter.
It held that the merger agreement compelled the respondents, FGMC and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, to respect the permanent status of the complainants.
They could not be dismissed without cause. The seasonal demand of respondents
for workers was not a lawful cause to dismiss the complainants who have always
been considered permanent, rather than seasonal, workers at <st1:city><st1:place>Paramount</st1:place></st1:city>.
The respondents were directed to reinstate them to their former positions with
full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">FGMC and/or Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> filed the present
petition for certiorari with a prayer for the issuance of a preliminary
injunction, to restrain the enforcement and/or implementation of the questioned
NLRC decision and its resolutions. The petition alleged that:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">1. <span class="GramE">there</span> was neither testimonial nor documentary
evidence proving the private respondents' allegation of illegal dismissal; and<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">2. <span class="GramE">there</span> was no violation of their right
to due process.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> had already sold all
his share-holdings in FGMC two months before the contracts of the private
respondents <span class="GramE">expired,</span> hence, he had no <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with FGMC at the time the private respondents were
terminated.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition has no merit.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">The agreement between Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and ANGLO
dated <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1988</st1:date>
clearly stated that:<o:p></o:p></p>
