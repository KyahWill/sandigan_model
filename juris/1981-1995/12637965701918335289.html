<p class="BODY">It is the stand of the petitioner that the land in question
covered by Plan Psu-43639 is part of the public forest within the Central
Cordillera Forest Reserve established under Proclamation No. 217 of Governor

is not suitable for agricultural purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The representative of the Bureau of Forestry, Forester Ricardo D.
<span class="SpellE">Zapatero</span>, submitted to the Provincial Fiscal a separate
report dated <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1970</st1:date>
to the effect that the whole area falls within the Cen<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">tral Cordillera Forest Reserve and that the same has not been released
for agricultural purposes by the Director of Forestry who had administrative
jurisdiction over the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner states that since the land in question is
indubitably part of the public forest and has not been reclassified or released
from the forest <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">zone, </span>the same
can not be the subject of registration either under Act 496, otherwise known as
the Land Registration Act, or under Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141,
otherwise known as the Public Land Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner points out that lands within the forest zone or within a
duly established reservation do not form part of the disposable portion of the
public domain nor can the same be alienated as said lands are not capable of
private appropriation or ownership and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">possession
thereof, </span>however long, cannot convert the same into private property.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further argued by the petitioner that the private
respondents or their predecessors-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Salming</span>
<span class="SpellE">Piraso</span>, had not acquired ownership over the land
prior to its classification as part of the Cordillera Forest Reserve because
there is no evidence on record that <span class="SpellE">Salming</span> <span class="SpellE">Piraso</span> had possessed the property for any appreciable
period prior to 1929 when the land became part of the Cordillera Forest
Reserve.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondents assert that the
findings of fact of the Court of Appeals show that the land subject of
application is not within the Central Cordillera Forest Reserve and the same
land applied for registration is disposable and alienable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondents, as applicants, claim
to have sufficiently shown by preponderance of evidence that the land being
applied for registration had been possessed <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

</span>approved by the then Director of Lands, Jorge B. Vargas on March 6,
1925, while Proclamation No. 217 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Was </span>promulgated
only on February 16, 1929.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They state
that the approval of the said survey by the government thru the Director of
Lands Jorge B. Vargas can only mean that said land was no longer included in
the overall survey of the government as it was no longer part of the public
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As applicants, they contend that
they have possessed the land applied for in concept of owner, openly and
publicly, adverse against the whole world and continuously for more than thirty
(30) years before they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">filed
application over the land which is agricultural and separate from the public
domain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition to be meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is already a settled rule that forest
lands or forest reserves are not capable of private appropriation and
possession thereof, however long, cannot convert them into private property (<span class="SpellE">Vano</span> v. Government of Philippine Islands, 41 Phil. 161;
