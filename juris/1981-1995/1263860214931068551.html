<p class="BODY">Previously, the <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank had
filed with Us a petition to prohibit the enforcement pending appeal of the
Regional Trial Court's (<span class="SpellE">RTC's</span>) decision and on appeal
by <i>certiorari</i> from the decision of the then Intermediate Appellate Court
denying its petition for review of the said <span class="SpellE">RTC's</span>
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We consolidated and, later,
remanded both petitions to respondent CA for further proceedings on the merits,
hence, the above rulings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts found by the trial court, and adopted by the CA, are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"On September 29, 1963 the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank, formerly Filipinas Manufacturers Bank and Trust Company, leased from the
plaintiffs (now private respondents) 1,387 (should be, 1,384) square meters of
land commencing from January 1, 1963 and ending on December 31, 1983 as per
written contract Exhibit 'A'.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Paragraph 6 of the Contract of Lease allows the
petitioner, as lessee, to 'sublease any part or portion of the premises or the
whole portion thereof without obtaining the consent of the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>
thereto.'<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"On April 1, 1977, the petitioner 'subleased to <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Trinidad, President of <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>
Development and Industrial Corporation, a portion of 965 square meters with a
term that is coterminous with the original lease contract and therefore ending
also on December 31, 1983 which contract of sublease was likewise covered by a
written contract (Exhibit 10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
contract of sublease was subject to the same terms and conditions as of the original
contract of lease.’<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Sections 3 and 6 of the Contract of Sublease prohibited
the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
Trinidad from further subleasing the property subleased to him by the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Sections 3 and 6 of the Contract of Sublease provide:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

its right to sublease over the premises or any portion thereof under any circumstances
whatsoever; any contract made in violation of this clause shall be null and
void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is expressly understood and
agreed by the herein parties that the personal character of the SUBLESSEE as <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> represented and the nature of occupancy of the
leased premises as above restricted, constitute and are special considerations
and inducement for the granting of the sublease by the SUBLESSOR; consequently,
any violation, direct or indirect of any of the stipulations hereof shall
automatically and unequivocally terminate this contract of lease effective from
the time such violation occurs.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote><i>"<span class="SpellE">lnspite</span> of the prohibition to
sublease and in violation thereof, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Trinidad
'constructed stalls/stores thereon and lease the same to 12 persons who conducted
their individual business.’<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"On February 10, 1984, after the expiration of the lease on
December 31, 1983, private respondents filed an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, against the petitioner, as sole defendant, before
the MTC, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, which was docketed as Civil
Case No. 16193.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"The petitioner, as defendant, filed an answer, which in
the language of the decision of the MTC 'did not oppose the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
as it affirmed the expiration of the lease contract on December 31, 1983 but
opposed the increased rentals being demanded by the plaintiffs after the
expiration of the lease contending that the demanded increase is unconscionable
and unreasonable.'<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"On </i><st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="7"><i>July 6,
 1984</i></st1:date><i>, six months after the expiration of the lease and five
months after the filing of the complaint, defendant bank 'surrendered the
premises it occupied by surrendering to the court the key to the bank
structure.'" (pp. 32-43, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case against <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> Industrial Development
Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>, for short) on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="9">26 September 1984</st1:date> with the same MTC,
docketed as Civil Case No. 16617, after the latter court denied its Motion to
Admit Third Party Complaint in Civil Case No. 16193, the original <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These two cases were subsequently consolidated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, upon motion of the defendants
therein, Civil Case No. 16617 was dismissed without prejudice to whatever
liability said defendants may have in the original <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent CA narrates further:</p>

<blockquote><i>"The MTC, on </i><st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="12"><i>December
 27, 1984</i></st1:date><i>, rendered a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"WHEREFORE, for reasons given, judgment is hereby rendered
for the plaintiffs, ordering defendant <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank
to pay the former the sum of P180,000.00 representing the reasonable rental
value of the subject premises from </i><st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="1"><i>January
 1, 1984</i></st1:date><i> to </i><st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="6"><i>June
 30, 1984</i></st1:date><i> at the rate of P30,000.00 a month.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Judgment is likewise rendered against <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> Development and Industrial
Corporation and all persons claiming right under them to vacate the subleased
premises and surrender possession thereof to the plaintiffs, and to pay the
latter the sum of P180,000.00 representing reasonable rental value of the
subject premises from July 1984 to December 1984 at the rate of P30,000.00 a
month up to and until the subleased premises is finally vacated and possession
surrendered to the plaintiffs.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"The <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> Development and Industrial Corporation are
likewise ordered to pay, pro rata, the sum of P10,000.00 as and for attorney's
fees plus costs of the suit.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Both petitioner and private respondents appealed from this
Decision. <o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>"On January 11,
1985, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Trinidad, who was not a party in Civil
Case No. 16193 filed a motion for reconsideration assailing the portion of the
decision making him liable to pay a monthly rental on the ground that the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> is not a party to the case and is not in physical
or material possession of the leased premises after the expiration of the
contract of lease on December 31, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, according to petitioner, when they vacated the premises on </i><st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="7"><i>July 6, 1984</i></st1:date><i>, the only
occupants of the premises in question were the stall-holders or vendors with
whom neither the petitioner nor the private respondents had any <span class="SpellE">privity</span> of contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, petitioner observed, both the MTC and private respondents'
counsel referred to the stallholders as squatters, citing the transcript of the
hearing of </i><st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="3"><i>March 27, 1984</i></st1:date><i>.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After considering the facts and the arguments raised by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are constrained to dismiss the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>At the outset, there is
no doubt that the lessee in a contract of lease is obliged to return the thing
subject of said contract upon the expiration of the period agreed upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1665 of the Civil Code expressly
requires that the thing leased be returned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it stands to reason and the spirit of the law that, as a general
rule, not only a portion of the thing leased be returned but the whole of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally the law mandates that the thing
leased be returned in the same condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This leads us to the question of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank is deemed to have performed its obligation
to return the property to the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>, the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>-owners. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The
answer is in the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be
borne in mind that from the start, the contract of sub-lease between the
sub-lessee and the present occupants is null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In point is the contract of sublease between <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank as sub-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>,
Sections 3 and 6 of which provide:</p>

<blockquote><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the SUBLESSEE
hereby expressly agrees and warrants that the leased premises shall be used by

Terminal store or market and that the SUBLESSEE is hereby strictly prohibited
from using said premises for any other purpose without the prior consent of the
SUBLESSOR.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

shall not directly or indirectly sublease, assign, transfer, convey, mortgage
or in any way encumber its right to sublease over the premises or any portion
thereof under any circumstances whatsoever; any contract made in violation of
this clause shall be null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is expressly understood and agreed by the herein parties that the personal character
of the SUBLESSEE as <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> represented and the
nature of occupancy of the leased premises as above restricted, constitute and
are special considerations and inducement for the granting of the sublease by
the SUBLESSOR; consequently, any violation, direct or indirect of any of the stipulations
hereon shall automatically and <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span>
terminate this contract of lease effective from the time such violation occurs.</i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is well entrenched in this
jurisdiction that the contract is the law between the parties thereof (Phil.
American General Insurance v. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, 61 SCRA 22;
Herrera v. <span class="SpellE">Petrophil</span> Corporation, 146 SCRA 360)
provided nothing therein is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public
policy, or public order (<span class="SpellE">Lagunsad</span> v. Soto, 92 SCRA
476).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the clear and
express provisions of the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> contract, there
is no doubt that the contract entered into by Mr. Trinidad further sub-leasing
a portion of the premises to the present occupants, is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the above, the present occupants cannot exactly be
said to be claiming rights under <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank, such
claim of right merely being apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The nullity of the occupants contract of sublease with Mr. Trinidad
completely negates any juridical relation between <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank and said occupants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such nullity
leads us to conclude that the present occupants did so occupy the premises
under their own name and responsibility, thus, properly <span class="SpellE">labelled</span>
“squatters" by the respondent CA (see Amended Decision, p. 53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in
view of the further sub-leasing of the premises to the present occupants, Mr.
Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> ceased to be <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank by
virtue of the automatic termination of said contract of sublease pursuant to
Section 6 thereof (supra).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
found by the respondent CA:</p>

<blockquote><i>"... <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> Development Corporation cannot
be accurately considered as claiming rights which emanated from the original <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-lessee relationship between the petitioner Bank and
the private respondents. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It has been
clearly established that such relationship has been tarnished by the violation
committed by the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> in further subletting the
premises to the squatters." </i>(Amended Decision, p. 53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Hence, when <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank surrendered the key to the premises it physically occupied, it is deemed
to have completely returned the premises leased to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The obligation then to evict the occupants in
the premises could not be attributed to <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank since any juridical relation between the Bank and the occupants no longer
exists and that the original contract of lease had already been terminated by
virtue of said bank's withdrawal from the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly ruled by the MTC in dismissing
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit filed by <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank against Mr. Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>, and the
occupants:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Upon the termination or expiration

dispossessed of any legal right to eject the defendant <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>
because there is no more contract between them to speak of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The authority of the plaintiff bank springs
from their sublease contract which already expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It now devolves upon the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>,
the landowner, to do the ejecting of the defendant, but since the former has already
filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit against the <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank, as the original lessee, there is no more
need to file another suit against the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> because ‘a judgment of eviction against the tenant
binds and is enforceable against his <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> although

<p class="BODY">Clearly then, in the light of the foregoing discussion, the
present occupants did occupy the premises in question in their own
capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cannot be said to have a
claim of right springing from the <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank as
original lessee because the lease agreement between Mr. Trinidad (as president
of <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>) and the present occupants is null and
void, it being contrary to the contract of sub-lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the said contract of sub­lease
having been automatically ended when Mr. Trinidad further sub-leased the
premises to the occupants, no true claim of right to possess the said premises
may be ascribed to said occupants as emanating from <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, the latter cannot be
considered the proper party to oust said occupants within the meaning of
Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">If anybody is to blame for the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>’
inability to possess the premises occupied, it should be Mr. Trinidad and the
occupants themselves for having gone against the contract of sub-lease between
the former and <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>'
claim, fault cannot be imputed to <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank in
sub-leasing part of the property to Mr. Trinidad as president of <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> precisely because the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>
themselves allowed sub-letting in the original contract of lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the respondent CA,
"paragraph 6 of the contract of lease allows the petitioner, as lessee, to
'sublease any part or portion of the premises or the whole portion thereof
without obtaining the consent of the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> thereto,’”
(p. 33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank even acted in
herein petitioners' favor in providing for Sections 3 and 6 in the contract of
sub-lease (supra).</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the question on the applicability of Articles
1266 and 1651 of the Civil Code in relation to Article 1665, We rule that,
under the circumstances, it should be resolved in the negative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1266 cannot validly apply to the
present case since it makes express reference to obligations to do (or personal
obligations).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This being so, it may not
be invoked in exempting <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank (as lessee)
from returning the whole property to the owners thereof for such obligation to
return is in the nature of an obligation to give (or a real obligation), in
which case Article 1262, not Article 1266, applies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, for reasons already discussed
above, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> is deemed to have fully satisfied
its obligation to return the whole property leased.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:171.0pt">Similarly, Article 1651 cannot be
correctly read with Article 1665 in the latter's application to the case at bar
concerning the propriety of requiring the sub-lessees (i.e., Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>) to pay rents directly to the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Article
1651 clearly and expressly refers to the use and preservation of the thing
leased and not to the matter of payment of rents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so precisely because it is Article
1652 which outlines the sub-lessee's liability for rents.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In their second assigned
error, the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span> assail the respondent CA's finding
that <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank had "completely
vacated" (see pp. 49, 52, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) the premises,
such being a misapprehension of the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They clarify that <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank surrendered
only a portion of the entire 1,387 square meters subject of the lease contract,
about 965 square meters of which are still occupied by the sub-lessees of My
Trinidad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank insists that it has indeed vacated the place
completely, having physically and actually withdrawn from the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find no cogent reason for Us to deviate
from the said finding of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we had said earlier, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank
actually and physically withdrew from the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has packed up all its properties and
delivered the key to the building it occupied to the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>
of Mr. Trinidad remain in possession of a larger portion of the property does
not change the truth that <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank has
completely left the same and that it has performed its obligation to return the
property leased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is because the
occupants cannot be properly considered as claiming rights from <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank, as already discussed above.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They possess the bigger portion of the
property in their own name; <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank is not
privy to the fact of their possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank is not responsible for
the acts of the present occupants in entering the premises although they claim
an apparent right from the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Anent the third and
fourth assigned errors, the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span> essentially take
exception to the respondent CA's ruling making Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> and all persons claiming rights under them
primarily liable for rents from July 1984, when <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank left the premises, until the same are finally vacated and possession
restored to the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue that Article 1651 of the Civil
Code does not find application under the circumstances and maintain that Article
1652 should be solely applied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also
assail the CA's finding that Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>
were parties in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case before the trial
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank similarly contends that Article 1652 is
inapplicable since it assumes the existence of a lease contract between the
parties as well as a contract of sub-lease with Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> from July 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It also maintains that Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>
are deemed parties to the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is Our considered view that the respondent
CA correctly held the sub-lessees primarily liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regard the application of either Article 1651 or 1652 of the
Civil Code, We rule that neither can be properly invoked under the
circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly noted by the
<span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span>, and as We have mentioned earlier, Article
1651 refers to the sub-lessee's liability to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
for acts relating to the use and preservation of the property leased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may not be resorted to in determining the
sub-lessee's liability for rent since Article 1652 specifically governs that
aspect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, Article 1652 cannot
also be applied in determining <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank's
liability for rents from July 1984 onwards precisely because no contract of
lease existed from that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
original contract of lease expired on <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From then on, as
correctly pointed out by <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank on pages 17
to 18 of its Motion to Dismiss, the lease was renewed from month to month
pursuant to Articles 1670 and 1687 of the Civil Code until it was finally
terminated on July 6, 1984 when said Bank left the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ergo, the respondent CA did not commit any
error in requiring <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank to pay rents only
for the time the latter occupied the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously then, it should be Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>
and all persons claiming rights under them who should be liable to pay rents to
the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span> from the time <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank abandoned the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the question of whether or not Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> are parties to the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case filed by the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span> against <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank, We hold that they indeed are.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Going back to the facts, the <span class="SpellE">Syjucos</span> filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case with the MTC on <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1984</st1:date> docketed as Civil Case No.
16193.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank's Motion to Admit Third Party complaint against Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span> was denied, the said Bank filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit against the latter on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1984</st1:date> (see Complaint, p. 107, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) and the same was docketed as Civil Case No.
16617.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On Motion of <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank, the MTC ordered the consolidation of Civil Case No. 16617 with Civil Case
No. 16193, the original <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit (see p. 177, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
on motion of Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>, Civil Case
No. 16617 was dismissed on <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1984</st1:date> with the following reservation made by the MTC:</p>

<blockquote>"This is, however, without prejudice
to whatever liability the defendant herein as <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>,
may have in the case filed by the property owner against the <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank since the eviction of the latter binds the
defendant." (MTC Order p. 117, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">While the MTC dismissed Civil Case No
16617 on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank "has
been dispossessed of any legal right to eject the defendant <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>
because there is no more contract between them to speak of" (MTC Decision,
p. 116, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), it recognized the impending liability
of the defendants therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, from
the above-quoted pronouncement, it is clear that the MTC did not totally
relinquish its, jurisdiction over Mr. Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Kalayaan</span>,
enabling it to hold the latter primarily liable for rents from July 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, when a lessee's right to remain
terminates, the right of a sub lessees to continue in possession ceases to
exist, being privies of the lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Coming now to the question
of Attorney's fees, We are inclined to uphold the CA's finding when it said:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Finally, <span class="SpellE">movants</span> assail the
award of attorney's fees to the petitioner bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No cogent reason has been advanced by <span class="SpellE">movants</span> to warrant a reversal of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We need not point out here that this case
emanated from the MTC; that certiorari was filed in the RTC, and later on an
appeal of the MTC Decision was lodged in the RTC and so on and so forth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, this controversy has come full
circle to the <span class="SpellE">lAC</span>, to the Supreme Court and back to this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the Metropolitan Trial Court,
private respondents were apparently unsatisfied by the said Court's Decision,
which, for all appearances, already; completely and satisfactorily adjudicated
private respondents' claim and cause of action by ordering <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
even if the petitioner Bank had long been out of the leased premises, by
ordering full restitution of the premises, by ordering a money judgment
favorable to private respondents, with payment of attorney's fees, and by
rendering judgment against the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> and all
persons claiming rights under him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet,
private respondents, assisted by counsel, persevered and prolonged litigation
in the process, by lodging an appeal on their insistence that the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> are not parties in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></i>(p. 57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>
