				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner asks for the reversal of the decision of the then
Intermediate Appellate Court in AC-­G.R. No. CV-00881 which affirmed the
decision of the then Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch II in Civil Case
No. 116725 declaring private respondent Leung <span class="SpellE">Yiu</span> a
partner of petitioner Dan <span class="SpellE">Fue</span> Leung in the business
of Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span> and
ordering the petitioner to pay to the private respondent his share in the
annual profits of the said restaurant.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case originated from <span style="">a </span>complaint filed by respondent Leung <span class="SpellE">Yiu</span> with the then Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch
II to recover the sum equivalent to twenty-two percent (22%) of the annual
profits <span style="">derived from the operation of
Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span> </span><span style="">since </span><span style="">October, 1955 from petitioner Dan <span class="SpellE">Fue</span> Leung.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>, a restaurant,
located at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Florentino</span></span><span style=""> Torres Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">, Sta. Cruz, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, was established sometime in October,
1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="GramE">registered</span>
as a single proprietorship and its licenses and permits were issued to and in
favor of petitioner Dan <span class="SpellE">Fue</span> Leung </span>as <span style="">the sole proprietor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Leung <span class="SpellE">Yiu</span>
adduced evidence during the trial of the </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">to show that </span>Sun <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Wah</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span> was
actually a partnership and that he was one of the partners having contributed
P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span>to <span style="">its initial establishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The private respondent's
evidence is summarized as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">About the </span><span style="">time the Sun </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Wah</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span> started
to become operational, the private respondent gave P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as his contribution to the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is evidenced by a receipt identified as Exhibit “A” wherein the petitioner
acknowledged his acceptance of the P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> by
affixing his signature thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
receipt was written in Chinese characters so that the trial court commissioned
an interpreter in the person of Ms. Florence Yap to translate its contents into
English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Florence Yap issued a
certification and testified that the translation to the best of her knowledge
and belief was correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondent identified the signature on the receipt </span>as <span style="">that of the petitioner (Exhibit A-3) because
it was affixed by the latter in </span><span style="">his (private respondent's) presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witnesses So <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> </span><span style="">and Antonio Ah <span class="SpellE">Heng</span>
corroborated the private respondent's testimony </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the effect that they
were </span><span style="">both </span><span style="">present when the receipt (Exhibit
"A") was signed by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> further testified that he himself
received from the petitioner a similar receipt (Exhibit D) evidencing delivery
of his </span><span style="">own investment in </span><span style="">another </span>amount of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination was conducted by the PC Crime
Laboratory on orders of the trial court granting the private respondent's
motion for examination of certain documentary exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The signatures in Exhibits <span style="">"A" and </span>"D" when
compared to the signature of the petitioner appearing in the pay envelopes of
employees of the restaurant, namely Ah <span class="SpellE">Heng</span> and Maria
Wong (Exhibits H, H-1 to H-24) showed that the <span style="">signatures </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">two <span style="">receipts were indeed </span></span><span style="">the signatures </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, the private
respondent received from the petitioner </span><span style="">the amount </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> covered </span><span style="">by
the latter's Equitable Banking Corporation </span><span style="">Check No. 13</span><span style="">389470-B from the profits of the operation of the </span>restaurant for
the year 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Teodulo</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Diaz, </span><span style="">Chief of the Savings
Department of the China Banking Corporation testified that said check (Exhibit
B) was </span>deposited by and duly credited to the private respondent's
savings account with the bank after it was cleared by the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span>
bank, the Equitable Banking Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another witness Elvira <span class="SpellE">Rana</span> of the Equitable
Banking Corporation testified that the check in question was in fact and in
truth drawn by the petitioner and debited against his own account in said
bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact was clearly shown and
indicated in the petitioner's statement of account after the check (Exhibit B)
was duly cleared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rana</span>
further testified that upon clearance of the check and pursuant to normal
banking procedure, said check was returned to the petitioner as <span style="">the </span>maker thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner denied having received from the private respondent
the amount of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contested and impugned the genuineness of
the receipt (Exhibit D).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His evidence is
summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner did not receive any contribution at the time he
started the Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He used his savings from his salaries as an
employee at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Stotsenberg</span></st1:placename></st1:place> in Clark Field
and later as waiter at the Toho Restaurant amounting to a little more than P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as capital in establishing Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
bolster his contention that he was the sole owner of the restaurant, the
petitioner presented various government licenses and permits showing the Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span> was and still is a
single proprietorship solely owned and operated by <span class="GramE">himself</span>
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fue</span>
Leung also flatly denied having issued to the private respondent the receipt
(Exhibit G) and the Equitable Banking Corporation's Check No. 13389470 B in the
amount of P12,000.00 (Exhibit B).</p>

<p class="BODY">As between the conflicting evidence of the parties, the trial
court gave credence to that of the plaintiff's.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the court ruled in favor of the <span style="">private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span class="SpellE"><span style="">dispositive</span></span><span style=""> portion of the decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The private respondent
filed </span><span style="">a

reconsideration in the nature of a motion for new trial and, as supplement to
the said motion, he requested that the decision rendered should include the net
profit of the Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>
which was not specified in the decision, and allow private respondent to adduce
evidence </span>so <span style="">that the said
decision will be </span><span style="">comprehensively adequate </span><span style="">and
thus put an end to further </span><span style="">litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion was granted
over </span><span style="">the objections </span><span style="">of the pe</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">itioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the trial court rendered an
amended decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the motion for
reconsideration filed by the plaintiff, <span class="GramE">which</span> was

P5,000.00 as and for attorney's fees and costs of suit." (p. 150, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed the trial court's amended decision to the
then Intermediate Appellate Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
questioned decision was further modified by the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the appellate court's decision reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">the same resolution,
the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner was denied. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both the trial court and
the appellate court found that the private respondent <span style="">is a</span> partner of the petitioner in the setting up and operations of
</span>the <span class="SpellE">panciteria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">While
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portions merely ordered the payment
of the respondent's share, there is no question from the factual findings that
the <span style="">respon</span>dent invested in the
business as <span style="">a </span>partner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the two courts declared that the
private petitioner is entitled to a share of the annual profits of the
restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, however,
claims that this factual finding is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the petitioner argues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
complaint avers that private respondent extended ‘financial assistance' to

return of which private respondent allegedly will receive a share </span>in <span style="">the profits of the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same complaint did not </span>claim <span style="">that private respondent is a partner of the
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was, </span>therefore, a serious error for the lower court and the Hon.
Intermediate Appellate </span>Court <span style="">to
grant a relief not called for by the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also error for the Hon. Intermediate Appellate Court to interpret
or construe 'financial assistance' to mean the contribution of capital by a
partner to partnership;" (p. 75, </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

to the petitioner with the understanding that <span style="">he would be entitled to twenty-two percent (22%) of the annual profit
derived from the operation of the said <span class="SpellE">panciteria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These allegations, which were proved, make
the private respondent and the petitioner partners in the establishment of Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span> because Article
1767 of the Civil Code provides that "By the contract of partnership two
or more persons bind themselves to contribute </span><span style="">money, property or </span><span style="">industry
to a common fund, with the intention of dividing the profits among
themselves".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Therefore, the lower
courts did not err in construing the complaint as one wherein the private </span>respondent

notwithstanding the use of the term <span style="font-style: italic;">financial
assistance</span><span style=""><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellate court's
observation to the effect that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">given </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">ordinary meaning, financial assistance ‘is
the </span><span style="">giving </span>out of money

this circumstance under which the P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was given
to the petitioner does not obtain <span style="">in </span>this

that "as a return for such <span style="font-style: italic;">financial assistance,</span> plaintiff
(private respondent) would be entitled to twenty-two <span class="SpellE">percentum</span>
(22%) of the annual profit derived from the operation of the said <span class="SpellE">panciteria</span>." (p. 107, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)

action." <span class="GramE">(De <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> v.

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">a</span>ppellate
court did not err in declaring that the main issue in the instant case was
whether or not the private respondent is a partner of the petitioner in the
establishment of Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also contends that the respondent court gravely
erred in giving probative value to the PC Crime Laboratory Report (Exhibit
"J") on the ground that the alleged <span style="font-style: italic;">standards</span> or specimens
used by the PC Crime Laboratory in arriving at the conclusion were  <span style="font-style: italic;">never
testified to by any
witness nor has any witness identified
</span>the handwriting in the standards or specimens belonging to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The supposed standards or specimens of
handwriting <span style="">were </span>marked as
Exhibits "H", "H-1" to "H-24" and admitted as
evidence <span style="">for </span>the private
respondent over the vigorous objection of the petitioner's counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the PC Crime Laboratory upon orders of the
lower court examined the signatures in the two receipts issued separately by
the petitioner to the private respondent and So <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>
(Exhibits "A" and "D") and compared the signatures on them
with the signatures of the petitioner on the various pay envelopes (Exhibits
"H", "H-1" to "H-24") of Antonio Ah <span class="SpellE">Heng</span> and Maria Wong, employees of the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the usual examination conducted on the
questioned documents, the PC Crime Laboratory submitted its findings (Exhibit
J) attesting that the signatures appearing in both receipts (Exhibits
"A" and "D") were the signatures of the <span style="">petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records also show that when the pay envelopes (Exhibits
"H", "H-1" to "H-24") were presented by the
private respondent for marking as exhibits, the petitioner did not interpose
any objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did the
petitioner file an opposition to the motion of the private respondent to have
these exhibits together with the two receipts examined by the PC Crime
Laboratory despite due notice to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, no explanation has been offered for his silence nor was any hint
of objection registered for that purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, we find no reason why Exhibit
"J" should be rejected or ignored.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records sufficiently establish that there was a partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner raises the issue of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He
argues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hon. Respondent Intermediate
Appellate Court gravely erred in not resolving the issue of prescription in

Code which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The argument is not
well-taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The private respondent </span>is
<span style="">a partner of </span>the <span style="">petitioner </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requisites of a partnership which are -
1) two or </span>more persons <span style="">bind
themselves to contribute money, property, or industry to a common fund; and 2)
intention on the part </span>of <span style="">the
partners to divide the profits among themselves (Article 1767, Civil Code; <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> v. Yang <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> Cheng, 106
Phil. 110) - have been established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
<span style="">stated by the respondent, a partner
shares not only in profits but </span><span style="">also
in the losses of the firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If excellent
relations exist among the partners at the start of a business and </span><span style="">all </span><span style="">the partners are more interested in seeing the firm grow rather than
get immediate returns, a deferment of sharing in the profits is perfectly
plausible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be incorrect to
state that if a partner does not assert his rights anytime within ten </span><span style="">years </span><span style="">from the start of operations, such rights are
</span><span style="">irretrievably
lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private </span><span style="">respondent's cause of action is premised upon
the failure of the petitioner to give him the agreed profits in the operation
of Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect the private respondent was asking
for an accounting of his interests in the partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is Article 1842 of the
Civil Code in conjunction with Articles 1144 and 1155 which is applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1842 states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The right to an account of his interest shall accrue to any
partner, or his legal representative as against the winding up partners or the
surviving partners or the <span style="">person </span>or
partnership continuing the business, at the date of dissolution, in the absence
of any agreement to the contrary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regarding the
prescriptive period within which the private respondent may demand an
accounting, Articles 1806, 1807, and 1809 show that the right to demand an
accounting exists as long as the partnership exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription begins to run only upon the dissolution
of the partnership when the final accounting is done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the petitioner assails the appellate court's monetary
awards in favor of the private respondent for being excessive and
unconscionable and above the claim of private respondent as embodied in his
complaint and testimonial evidence presented by said private respondent to
support his claim in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from his own testimony and allegations, the private respondent
presented the cashier of Sun <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Panciteria</span>,
a certain Mrs. Sarah L. <span class="SpellE">Licup</span>, to testify on the
income of the restaurant.</p>

court to cancel all hearings for January, 1981 and reset them to the later part
<span style="">of </span>the following month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's counsel never produced any

however, did not show the gross sales nor does it prove that the same is the
best evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court gave warning
to the defendant's counsel that if he failed to produce the books, the same
will be considered a waiver on the part of the defendant to produce the said
books inimitably showing decisive <span style="">records
</span>on the income of the eatery pursuant to the Rules of Court (Sec. 5(e)

presenting several witnesses, counsel for defendant promised that he will
present the defendant as his last witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notably there were several postponements asked by counsel for the
defendant and the last one was on October 1, 1981 when he asked that this case
