				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Florencio Hinsoy appealed from the decision of the Regional Trial Court at Dumaguete City, convicting him of rape, sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering him to pay Agustina Gemina, the offended party, P12,000 as damages.<br><br>Accused Hinsoy, a widower, 34, admitted that at around eleven o'clock in the evening of April 30, 1982 he had sexual congress with his neighbor, Agustina Gemina, a 43-year-old widow, in her house located in Barrio Banwague, Guihulngan, Negros Oriental, while she was lying between her two daughters, Narcisa and Gilda.&nbsp; The only issue is whether such intercourse was with Agustina's consent.<br><br>The prosecution's evidence shows that Hinsoy, who was naked below the waist, entered Agustina's house which was "three steps" above the ground.&nbsp; He was armed with a knife and a pistol.&nbsp; There was a kerosene lamp on the table.&nbsp; Agustina was awakened when Hinsoy embraced her.&nbsp; He announced that he was a member of the New People's Army.&nbsp; Agustina pleaded with him not to molest her.&nbsp; Narcisa, 12, who was sleeping on her left side, was also awakened.&nbsp; She asked Hinsoy not to harm her mother.&nbsp; He did not heed their pleas.<br><br>Hinsoy lifted Agustina's dress, ripped off her panty, which was torn as a result, and succeeded in copulating with her.&nbsp; Because she continuously resisted by moving her body, Hinsoy's semen was spread on her genital organ, thighs and abdomen.&nbsp; He poked his gun at her and threatened to kill her.&nbsp; She had bruises on her arm.<br><br>Agustina reported the incident to the barangay captain the following morning.&nbsp; Five days later, she complained to the police.&nbsp; She submitted to a medical examination.&nbsp; The attending physician found multiple contusions around her vagina and urethral orifice.<br><br>The barangay captain declared that when Hinsoy was arrested on May 5, 1982, he admitted having raped Agustina.&nbsp; He made the same admission to the police when he was investigated the next day, May 6.<br><br>On the other hand, Hinsoy testified that on the night of April 30, 1982 he was allegedly a guest of Agustina.&nbsp; He had supper in her house.&nbsp; She served horse meat.&nbsp; He slept in her house.&nbsp; At eleven o'clock he had sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; She had agreed to the sexual intercourse.&nbsp; He left her house in the morning.<br><br>The trial judge did not give credence to Hinsoy's pretension that the sexual intercourse was due to mutual agreement.&nbsp; He found no reason whatsoever why Agustina would frame up Hinsoy or would act in a vindictive manner towards him.&nbsp; He concluded that her "simple and natural testimony" was credible and trustworthy.<br><br>The contention of appellant's counsel that Agustina lied and concocted the rape charge cannot be taken seriously.&nbsp; She would not have taken the considerable trouble of bringing him to court if the charge was not true.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against the appellant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Makasiar, (Chairman), Abad Santos, Escolin,</i> and <i>Cuevas, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Concepcion, Jr., J.,</i> on leave.</div>
