				<BR><BR><p align="justify">August 22, 1981 was the natal day of Rodelio Refran.&nbsp; It was 
also a fatal day for him.&nbsp; Around 10:30 o'clock in the evening of that day, upon 
returning home after celebrating his birthday with friends with whom he had a 
drinking spree in a nearby house, Rodelio Refran was hacked and stabbed to death 
right at the back of his house, by the alley leading to Juan Luna Street, Tondo, 
Manila.<br><br>He was brought to Mary Johnston Hospital where he was pronounced 
dead on arrival.&nbsp; An autopsy conducted by Dr. Marcial G. Cenido, Medico-Legal 
Officer at the Western Police District, showed that two wounds were inflicted on 
him, one a hacking wound on his right forehead and another, a penetrating stab 
wound on the left upper quadrant of his abdomen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> According to Dr. Cenido, the wound in the 
victim's forehead was not fatal; it was the deep abdominal stab wound which 
caused the victim's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Sworn statements of two neighbors 
and the victim's mother were taken by the police on August 24, 1981.&nbsp; Edmundo 
Alba, a twenty-one year old neighbor of the victim who was with him earlier at 
the drinking session, stated that from the back of his house, he saw the 
assailants of Rodelio Refran, one by the name of Boy Hapon who lived in the 
neighborhood, and a companion whom he could not identify.&nbsp; It was the latter who 
hacked the victim in the head, while Boy Hapon followed suit by stabbing him in 
the stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Adelina 
Panambitan-Lara, also a neighbor, made a similar declaration, but stated that 
she did not recognize the assailants; however, she described their physical 
appearance and declared that if she sees them, she can identify them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Bienvenida Refran, mother of the 
victim, stated in her sworn statement that she did not see the stabbing of her 
son, but that when she opened the back door of her house, she saw Rudy Hapon 
together with another man going out of the alley leading to Juan Luna 
Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Boy Hapon was 
identified by police investigator Pfc. Isagani Tolentino as Rodolfo Ramirez in 
his "Advance Report" dated August 23, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> According to Pfc. Tolentino, police 
informers with whom he tried to talk were afraid to give out information on Boy 
Hapon, who had a notorious reputation in the neighborhood because his family 
wielded some influence in the vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>More than three months after the 
incident, or on November 27, 1981, at about 8:00 a.m., appellant Narciso Atienza 
was arrested by police operatives led by Pfc. Tolentino while walking along 
Reina Regente, based on the information supplied by an unidentified informant 
brought to the police station by Eugenio Estrella, a brother-in-law of the 
deceased.&nbsp; Appellant was pinpointed as the one "who hacked the victim to 
death".&nbsp; The appellant submitted to the arrest without any resistance and was 
brought to the police station of the Western Police District.&nbsp; When 
investigated, appellant refused to give any written statement but denied his 
participation in the killing of the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The following day, Edmundo Alba, 
Bienvenida Refran, and Adelina Panambitan-Lara were summoned to the police 
headquarters.&nbsp; There, they identified Narciso Atienza in separate police 
line-ups as the "very person who hacked the victim on the head with the jungle 
bolo".&nbsp; These witnesses executed identical sworn statements,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> all dated November 28, 1981, although 
obviously of the three, Bienvenida Refran could not have identified Narciso 
Atienza as the person who hacked her son because in her previous statement on 
August 24, 1981, she stated that she did not see her son hacked.<br><br>In an 
information dated December 7, 1981, Narciso Atienza was indicted for Murder and 
Frustrated Murder, committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"That on or about August 22, 1981, in the City of Manila, 
Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together with two 
others, whose true names, real identities and present whereabouts are still 
unknown and helping one another, and taking advantage of superior strength, did 
then and there wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, with intent to kill, and 
with treachery and evident premeditation, attack, assault and use personal 
violence upon one RODELIO REFRAN Y DE LA PENA, by then and there hacking the 
latter on the head with a jungle bolo and stabbing him on the abdomen with a 
bladed weapon, thereby inflicting upon the said Rodelio Refran y de la Pena 
mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death 
thereafter.<br><br>Contrary to law." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Arraigned on January 18, 1982, the accused pleaded not 
guilty.<br><br>Rodolfo Ramirez, <em>alias</em> Boy Hapon, was never apprehended 
nor brought to trial, although a separate information was filed against him 
(Criminal Case No. CCC-VI-96 (82) of the defunct Circuit Criminal 
Court).<br><br>On November 13, 1983, the trial court rendered a judgment 
convicting the accused, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused, Narciso Atienza y 
Peralta, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, qualified by 
treachery, and there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, hereby 
sentences him to suffer the penalty of <em>RECLUSION PERPETUA</em>; to pay the 
heirs of the deceased, Rodelio Refran the following sums:&nbsp; P12,000.00 for the 
death of the latter, P11,000.00 representing actual expenses incurred during the 
wake and the funeral, P20,000.00 by way of moral damages, and P10,000.00 by way 
of corrective damages by way of example or correction for the public good; and 
to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Assailing the legality of his conviction, appellant alleges 
that:&nbsp; 1) the decision of the trial court violated Rule 120 of the 1985 Rules of 
Criminal Procedure in that it does not "contain clearly and distinctly a 
statement of the facts proved or admitted by the accused"; and 2) there was no 
sufficient basis for convicting appellant, even assuming that there was a valid 
judgment.<br><br>The first allegation of the appellant has no merit.&nbsp; The trial 
court's decision sums up the evidence for the prosecution consisting of the 
testimonies of Edmundo Alba, Bienvenida Refran, Adelina Panambitan-Lara, Pfc. 
Isagani Tolentino and Dr. Marcial G. Cenido.&nbsp; The decision also summarizes the 
testimonies of the three witnesses for the defense, Esmundo Jovinar, Danilo 
Calma and the accused, Narciso Atienza.&nbsp; From the evidence, the trial court 
makes the following findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"From the foregoing evidence on record, it is clear that the 
accused, Narciso Atienza, was present at the scene of the crime when the victim, 
Rodelio Refran was hacked and stabbed to death.&nbsp; Two prosecution witnesses, 
Edmundo Alba and Adelina Lara declared that it was he who hacked the victim and 
that it was Rudy Hapon whose real name is Rodolfo Ramirez, who stabbed the 
deceased.&nbsp; On the other hand, the accused declared that it was Rodolfo Ramirez 
who hacked and stabbed Rodelio Refran and that he even tried to prevent Rodolfo 
from further attacking Rodelio by wresting away Rodolfo's jungle bolo.</p>
<p align="justify">The Court is of the opinion and so holds that the story told by 
the prosecution witnesses is nearer to the truth, that is, that accused Narciso 
Atienza hacked the victim on the head with a jungle bolo and that Rodolfo 
Ramirez (who is charged in Crim. Case No. CCC-VI-96(82) of the defunct Circuit 
Criminal Court of Manila, but had not been arrested up to the present) stabbed 
said victim on the upper quadrant of the abdomen.<br><br>First, Rodolfo Ramirez 
was already known to the witnesses even before the killing and in fact, it was 
only said Rodolfo Ramirez, <em>alias</em> "Rudy Hapon" among the three suspects, 
whose name was reported to the police (See Exh. J, Advance Report).&nbsp; When 
accused Narciso Atienza, whose name was unknown at the time of the killing was 
identified by police informants and was apprehended, he was duly identified by 
the eyewitnesses, and thereby have no ill motive in imputing upon him a grave 
crime which involves the penalty of death.<br><br>Secondly, by his own 
admission, the accused himself disposed of the bolo by throwing it away on his 
way home after the killing.<br><br>And thirdly, the prosecution's witnesses 
testified in a calm and straightforward manner, answering all questions clearly 
and with candor, which are the earmarks of sincerity and spontaneity.&nbsp; They 
weathered extensive and intensive cross-examination from defense counsel and 
were even able to describe the clothing worn by the accused and his companion, 
Rodolfo Ramirez, at the time of the killing.<br><br>Thus, the accused must be 
held guilty of the crime of murder, qualified by treachery, for having acted in 
concert with another or others in killing Rodelio Refran who was attacked so 
suddenly such that he had no chance of putting up any defense which he may have 
minded to make in order to avoid or parry the attack."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">There is therefore no basis for the charge that the trial 
court's decision does not conform to the requirements prescribed by Rule 120 of 
the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br>Anent the second assignment of 
error, we find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court, except as 
to its finding that treachery attended the commission of the offense since the 
accused "acted in concert with another or others in killing Rodelio Refran who 
was attacked so suddenly," giving him no chance to put up any defense.&nbsp; Acting 
in concert with another in committing an offense cannot be taken as proof of 
treachery, nor would the suddenness of the attack — assuming the same is shown 
by the evidence — be sufficient to constitute treachery.&nbsp; Treachery or 
<em>alevosia</em> may not be simply deduced from presumption as it is necessary 
that the existence of this qualifying circumstance should be proven as fully as 
the crime itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The qualifying 
circumstance should be established by positive evidence, which is absent in the 
case at bar.&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses did not testify as to the details of the 
assault and no evidence was offered to prove the circumstance of 
<em>alevosia</em>.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the evidence in this case indicates 
that the victim was attacked frontally, as shown by the fact that the wounds 
inflicted on him were all in the front part of his body.&nbsp; There is no evidence 
that the accused rushed toward the victim and attacked him suddenly.&nbsp; Even if it 
were shown that the attack was sudden, such circumstance is not sufficient to 
prove treachery.&nbsp; It must be shown that the mode of attack was knowingly adopted 
by the assailants to ensure the accomplishment of their criminal purpose without 
risk to themselves arising from any defense that the victim might offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Lacking such proof, the conviction of the 
accused for murder cannot be sustained.&nbsp; The crime is 
homicide.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the judgment appealed from is 
modified and the appellant declared guilty of homicide and sentenced to an 
indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision 
mayor</em> as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day 
of <em>reclusion temporal</em> as maximum, and to pay the heirs of Rodelio 
Refran the amount of P30,000.00 as indemnity for the latter's death and 
P11,000.00 for actual damages.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.</p>
