preliminary injunction seeking the annulment of the order of the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>respondent judge dated January 23,
1981, denying the motion for postponement and considering the case submitted
for decision after the filing of memoranda, the case to be decided on the basis
of the evidence presented by the private respondents, in Civil Case No. SM-705,
entitled Luz <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, et al. vs. Alfredo de Guzman.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as the year 1936, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
tenanted two parcels of land situated in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Taboc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Angat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, owned by the
private respondents who had inherited the same from their parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 2-3).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In the </span>year 1968
due to old <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">age a</span>nd <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sickness, Miguel </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
unable to farm his tenanted landholding assigned the two lands to his son
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and to his son-in-law, herein
petitioner, Alfredo de Guzman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
bigger land went to Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> while the smaller
<span class="GramE">parcel which consist</span> of 5.000 sq. meters went to
Alfredo de Guzman. (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 3)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The P50.00 </span>agreed
rental to be paid by the tenant was used to cultivate the portion assigned to
Ricardo, the products being reserved for the landowners (private respondents)
as their share.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parcel of land assigned to Alfredo had a meager production,
but Alfredo was able to make it more productive.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the year 1974, the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">respondents commenced the </span>recovery of the possession of the land
tilled by the petitioner on the ground that the former did not recognize the
latter as their lawful tenant despite the fact that petitioner had been working
on the land for more than seven years at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 3).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents filed with the Department of Agrarian
Reform (DAR) office at <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
<span class="GramE">the</span> recovery of possession case (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 73).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the DAR
investigator ruled that there was a tenancy relationship between petitioner and
private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "A" p. 12-15).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unsatisfied with the ruling, private respondents, requested that
the DAR case be transferred to the DAR office in <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> where the case was eventually heard
again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hearing was <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>the petitioner not having been
notified thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hearing officer
opined that no tenancy relationship existed between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1975</st1:date>,
armed with the Report of the Hearing Officer, private respondents filed a civil
action for recovery of possession of the land, Civil Case SM-705.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 3).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a responsive pleading had been filed by the petitioner, the
respondent judge set the pre-trial of the case, but on December 13, 1975,
counsel for private respondents filed their first motion to postpone the
pre-trial conference set for February 2, 1976 which motion was granted by
respondent judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "C" p. 18).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1976</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion to conduct preliminary hearing to determine the
respondent judge's jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "D"
p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">p</span>. 19-22).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1977</st1:date>,
private respondents filed their second motion to postpone the hearing set for <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1977</st1:date> which motion was
granted by the respondent judge in its order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Annex "E" p. 24).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1977</st1:date>,
an order was issued by the respondent judge directing the conduct of a
preliminary hearing to determine the court's jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex
"F" p. 25)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="25" month="7">July<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>25, 1977</st1:date>, another motion was
filed by private respondents on the ground that they were not ready to present
their evidence, which order was granted by the judge, who set the hearing for <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Annex "G" p. 26).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1977</st1:date>,
respondent judge ruled that based on the report made by DAR Regional Office,
there was no tenancy relationship between the parties, thus, the court had
jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "H" p. 27).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the hearing of <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1978</st1:date>, petitioner moved to defer the hearing of the case because
a motion for reconsideration had been filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such motion was denied and an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">parte</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>hearing was conducted to receive
private respondents' evidence in the absence of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex
"I" p. 28)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1978</st1:date>,
respondent judge granted another motion to reset the case on the motion of the
private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex “J" p. 29)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1979</st1:date>,
private respondents filed another motion for postponement, on the ground that
their counsel would be out of the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The motion was granted and hearing was reset.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1979</st1:date>,
an order was issued by respondent judge granting another postponement requested
by the private respondents for failure to produce their witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1980</st1:date>, still another motion for postponement
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Annexes "L" &amp; “M” pp. 32-35).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1980</st1:date>,
the case was again postponed for the reason that the respondent judge went on
vacation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It took several settings of
the case before private respondents finally rested their case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pp. </span>5-6).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was then petitioner's turn to present his evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But his counsel had to ask for postponement
because he could not reach on such short notice his client.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1981</st1:date>,
respondent judge denied the motion for postponement and issued the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> order which gave as reason the fact that
petitioner had not even begun presenting his evidence and that petitioner had
previously asked for numerous postponements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent judge then declared the case submitted for decision
without presentation of petitioner's evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1981</st1:date>,
counsel for petitioner filed a motion to set aside the respondent judge order
of <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1981</st1:date> which
motion was denied in open court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1981</st1:date>, counsel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for petitioner </span>filed a motion for
reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> order, which
motion was likewise denied for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annexes "P" &amp;
"P-1" pp. 38-40<span class="GramE">,41</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">A petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition with preliminary
injunction was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1981</st1:date>, the Court issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>temporary restraining order and
required the respondents to file their comments (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Petition, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pp. </span>2-11, Resolution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pp. </span>42-44).</p>

<p class="BODY">Said comment was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1981</st1:date>, and the Court in the resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1981</st1:date>, required the petitioner to file
a reply, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Resolution p. 55) which was filed on
<st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court in the resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1981</st1:date>, gave due course
to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">petition </span>and required the
parties to file simultaneous Memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:348.75pt">The sole issue in this case is whether
or not respondent judge committed a grave abuse of discretion in denying
petitioner’s motion for postponement in violation of the due process clause of
the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:348.75pt">The records show that it was not the
defendant (petitioner herein) who requested for several postponements but
private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact it was a
motion for postponement filed by the petitioner on meritorious grounds but such
notwithstanding it was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:348.75pt">The Court has consistently maintained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>although a speedy determination
of an action implies a speedy trial, speed is not the chief objective of a
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Careful and deliberate
consideration for the administration of justice, a genuine respect for the
rights of all parties and the requirements of procedural due process and an <span class="SpellE">adherance</span> to the Court's standing admonition that the
discretion given judges in the granting or denial of motions for postponement
and the setting aside or denial of orders previously issued "should always
be predicated on the consideration that more than the mere convenience of the
courts or of the parties in the case the ends of justice and fairness would be
served thereby".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are more
important than <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>race to end the
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Amberti</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vs. </span>CA,
89 SCRA 240 [1979]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar there are circumstances that justify
postponement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is noted that the
petitioner has to present his case and adduce evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first hearing for the defense was set by
respondent judge for <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1981</st1:date>,
but the notice was received by the counsel for the petitioner only on <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to short notice and the fact that counsel
had an <span class="SpellE">intransferable</span> criminal case scheduled on
January 23, 1981 at the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> compelled petitioner's counsel to seek
postponement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another reason for postponement in the present case was the fact
that petitioner resides at <span class="SpellE">Sulucan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Angat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, some 65
kilometers from <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City where counsel of
petitioner resides, and due to such short notice, counsel could not contact
petitioner in due time to be in court ready for the hearing scheduled by the
respondent judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Sosa vs. Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>, 33 SCRA 601 (1970), it is stated that "where the
notice setting the case for trial in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> was received by counsel with law office in Manila
only one day before that date for trial, there is enough reason for the court
to postpone the trial and re-set it for another date instead of dismissing the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">case."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that motions for postponement are addressed to
the sound discretion of the courts, discretion must he exercised wisely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus in considering motions for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">postponement two things must be considered,
namely: </span>(1) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the reason for the
postponement, and (2) the merits of the case of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the case of <span class="SpellE">Pebeauco</span>
vs. Dir. of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Lands, 119 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">SCRA 102 (1982), the trial </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">judge </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">rather adhered to the technical and rigid enforcement of the rule </span>thereby
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">defeating the purpose thereof which is
to help and secure to the parties substantial justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case of PLDT vs. <span class="SpellE">Genova</span>, 116 SCRA 395 (1982), the Court </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">stated </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that "Even if PLDT had sought several postponements </span>due <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to absence of its witnesses, substantial
justice demands that it be given its day in court."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In view of the foregoing
it is manifest that respondent judge's denial of petitioner's motion for
postponement constitutes denial of due process and petitioner's right to his
day in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED,</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
order dated January 23, 1981 is NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE and the petitioner <span class="GramE">is</span> allowed to adduce evidence in his behalf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
