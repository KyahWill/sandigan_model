				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. C-2247 of the Court of First Instance of
Caloocan City, Branch XXXII, entitled "Yabut Freight Express, Inc., et
als. vs. Radio Communications of <span style="">the
Philippines, Inc. </span>(RCPI)", the freight company claimed that due to
"utter, patent, and wanton carelessness, gross negligence and un­pardonable
fault" of the personnel of RCPI, the latter transmitted erroneously a
telegram which should have read "No truck available" but instead read
"Truck available", As a consequence, the freight company suffered
damages, and prayed for an award of P100,00.00 as actual damages, P30,000.00 as
moral damages, exemplary or corrective damages in the discretion <span style="">of </span>the Court, and P15,000.00 as
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial Court, upheld by the Court of Appeals, awarded damages
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, defendant Radio, Communications of the
Philippines, Inc. is ordered to pay plaintiff Yabut Freight Express, Inc. the
sum of P10,000.00 as compensatory, plus P500.00 as actual, and P5,000.00 as
corrective damages plus P2,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses
with the costs of this suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner, Radio
Communications of the Philippines, Inc. (RCPI), elevated the case to us for
review on October 3, 1980 on the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"First:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court erred in finding that the suit was predicated on quasi-delict.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Second:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court erred in virtually ruling that the petitioner's acts were the proximate
cause of the alleged damage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Third:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court erred in awarding compensatory in addition to actual damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fourth:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court erred in condemning the petitioner to pay corrective damages and attor­ney's
fees plus costs and litigation expenses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fifth:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court erred in not finding that private respondent had committed negligence
which was the proximate cause of the alleged damage or at least, amounted to
contributory negligence warranting reduction of the award."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We gave due course to the
Petition on January 28, 1981, only in so far as the aspect of damages is concerned,
having found that respondent Court correctly concluded that the error in the
transmission of the telegram was due to the gross negligence of RCPI employees
and not to atmospheric disturbances as it claimed, and that there was no
contributory negligence on the part of the freight company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In respect of
compensatory and actual damages, it is not entirely erroneous to grant both
items of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were so awarded
in MD Transit vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 22 SCRA 559 (1968).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, compensatory and </span>actual damages
are dealt with in the Civil Code under the same Chapter 2 thereof and that the
two terms are used therein as equivalent to one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as provided for in Article 2200 of
the Civil Code, which is part of the aforementioned Chapter 2, indemnification
for damages shall comprehend not only the value of the loss suffered, or actual
damages ("damnum emergens"), but also that of the profits which the
obligee failed to obtain, or compensatory damages ("lucrum cessans").<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, there are two components to actual or compensatory damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this particular case,
the value of the actual loss suffered by Yabut has been proven to be P132.12
(not P500.00 as held by respondent Court).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This </span>is compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compensatory damages were also awarded for
injury to Yabut's "business reputation or business standing",
"loss of goodwill and loss of customers or shippers who shifted their
patronage to competitors".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
grant thereof is proper under the provisions of Article 2205 of the Civil Code,
which provides that damages may be recovered "for injury to the
plaintiff's business standing or commercial credit." And even if not
recoverable as compensatory damages, they may still be awarded in the concept
of temperate or moderate damages.</p>

<blockquote>"There are cases where from the nature of the case, definite
proof of pecuniary loss cannot be offered, al­though the court is convinced
that there has been such loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
instance, injury to one's commercial credit or to the goodwill of a business
firm is often hard to show with certainty in terms of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should damages be denied for that reason? The
judge should be empowered to calculate moderate damages in such cases, rather
than that the plaintiff should suffer, without redress from the defend­ant's
wrongful act."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Exemplary damages were
likewise properly imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contracts
and quasi-contracts, exemplary damages may be awarded if the defendant acted in
a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There was gross negligence on the part of
RCPI personnel in transmitting the wrong telegram, for which RCPI must be held
liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gross carelessness or negligence
constitutes wanton misconduct.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x </span>punitive
damages may be recovered for wilful or wantonly negligent acts in respect of messages,
even though those acts are neither authorized nor ratified (Arkansas &amp; L.R.
Co. v. Stroude, 91 SW 18; West <span style="">v.
Western U. Tel. Co., 17 P 807; Peterson v. Western U. Tel. Co., 77 NW 985;
Brown v. Western U. Tel. Co., 67 SE 146).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, punitive damages have been recovered for <u>mistakes</u> in the
transmission of telegrams (Pittman v. Western Union Tel. Co., 66 So 977;
Painter v. Western Union Tel. Co., 84 SE 293)"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (emphasis supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The award of attorney's
fees and expenses of liti­gation is likewise deemed just and equitable.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But while the assessment
of damages, except liqui­dated ones, is generally left to the discretion of the
Court according to the circumstances of each case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we find that the damages and attorney's fees
awarded are excessive and should be reduced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
