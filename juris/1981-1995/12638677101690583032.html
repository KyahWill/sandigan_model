				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) affirming
the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Fourth Judicial Region, Branch XXIX, <span style="">San </span>Pablo City in an agrarian case,
docketed as CAR Case No. 8258, filed by private respondents against petitioner
for sums of money representing their unpaid shares of the harvest as tenants of
the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, <span style="">as </span>found
by the trial court, and later affirmed by the appellate court, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The property subject matter of this case is landed estate
consisting of 53 hectares of coconut land, more or less, located in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Perez, <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>, Laguna,
formerly owned by the spouses Salvador and <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, now both deceased, who had during their
lifetime ten (10) children, and as of 1969 owned by SALESC, Inc., possession
was relinquished to <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Hernandez in 1957 under
a civil-law lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The houses of the
plaintiff are built in the cluster inside the property where they and their
respective family reside, at least as of 1973 according to defendant <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They built their houses clumped together within one area because of the <span class="SpellE">dange</span>(r) and threat posed by the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span>
movement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court finds the plaintiffs as <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">bonafide</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>agricultural tenants over the
plantation since world <span style="">war </span>II
when the property was personally cultivated by late Salvador <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and, upon his demise, by the late <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The several letters written by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, by herself and thru her daughter Benita,
addressed to <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Flores, are eloquent testimonies
of a tenancy relationship inasmuch as the plaintiffs are identified as ‘<span class="SpellE">bantay</span>' over the property and who are entitled to a share
in the harvest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter dated <st1:date year="1951" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1951</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<blockquote>"Coconut land is considered under our laws as agricultural
(See RA 1199 and 3844) and a share tenant is one whose <span class="SpellE">renumeration</span>
(sic) for cultivating land owned or possessed by another is determined by a
proportional percentage of the harvest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The act of cultivation includes cleaning or clearing of the under brush
within the plantation (Delos Reyes v. <span class="SpellE">Espineli</span>, 30
SCRA 574).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs have shown through
their evidence that they have been in possession of their respective areas in <span style="">the </span>plantation which they clean and
clear for the purpose of improving the harvest and <span style="">they are </span>paid <span style="">at </span>the rate of 1/6 of the harvest under the late Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and
reduced to <span style="">only </span>1/7 under the
tenure of defendant <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Hernandez.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court cannot accept the version of the defendants that
the plaintiffs were evicted from the premises in the year 1952 or 1953, or even
in 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipt evidencing the sale
of the coconuts to <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallevo</span>
for the years 1953 to 1957 inclusive (see <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'R'
to 'U' inclusive) which were produced by the plaintiffs prove that plaintiffs
not only were in the premises all along but had a hand or participation in the
harvest and its sale to <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallevo</span>; the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> are
educated people as may be gleaned from their family picture marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'P' and it is a surprise to the court why their
documentation of their relationship with the plaintiffs is haphazard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the practically illiterate
plaintiffs have shown some system in keeping track of the meager records made <span style="">available </span>to them by the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were even able to
produce the safe conduct passes issued by Mr. Arturo M. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
(See <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'C' and 'F'); although said passes are
only for a few days validity, the court considers the said <span style="">limitation as an act </span>of prudence on
the part of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> who apparently wanted to
avoid the theft of their coconuts which could otherwise be hauled even before
and after the harvest time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even if
the court takes into consideration the protestations made by the defendant, the
most it could do is create a doubt, in which case the same shall be resolved in
favor of the plaintiffs (see Sec. 56, RA 1199; Sec. 16, PD 946).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court notes that <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span>
Hernandez admitted that when he occupied the premises for the first <span style="">time </span>when the same was leased to him,
the plaintiffs were already inside the property planting crops, and this belies
the testimony of SALESC, Inc. that the plaintiffs had already been driven out
from the premises in the year 1952 or thereabout.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At any rate, it is immaterial if the plaintiffs had been
ejected as tenants in 1952 or 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
are anchoring this suit on the fact that they remained <span style="">as </span>agricultural tenants on the plantation even during the tenure
of <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Hernandez beginning the year 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs have been in continuous,
uninterrupted possession of the plantation <span style="">as </span>evidenced by their houses built thereon which Hernandez
himself admitted on the witness stand as having been constructed by the
plaintiffs who, according to him, insisted on constructing the same <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of his refusal to give them permission; if indeed
he had refused them permission to build their houses on the property, why did
Hernandez not call the authorities <span style="">or </span>report
the same to the landowner?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The civil law lease executed by SALESC Incorporated in favor
of <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Hernandez was reduced to writing only in
1970 (See <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. ‘<span class="GramE">2,’ ‘2-A’ to
'2-J').</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span>
Hernandez was not prohibited from taking in agricultural tenants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such prohibition, it
follows that whomever the civil lessee takes in a(s) agricultural tenant shall
bind the landowner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court hereby finds that the landholding of the plaintiff
are twelve hectares for <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Flores, fourteen
hectares <span style="">for </span>Juan Garcia, eight
hectares for <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Flores, seven hectares for
Francisco Flores, five hectares for Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>
and seven hectares for Simon <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> (see <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'A-1' and 'A-1-A' - and that aside from the coconut
trees planted thereon, the plaintiffs planted citrus, <span class="SpellE">lanzones</span>,
coffee, pineapples and bananas.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs used to have their houses in their respective landholdings
but with the advent of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> movement in the
area, they were constrained to build their houses in a cluster in the
landholding of Juan Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the
evidence submitted by the parties shows that the plaintiffs received as their
share from the coconut harvest starting the year 1980 only 1/7 of the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the records of this
case is an 'Urgent Manifestation and Motion dated October 24, 1983 filed by the
plaintiffs, giving the Court a breakdown of the coconut harvest of the property
and shares received by the plaintiffs as a whole and the court therefore holds
that for the period February to December, 1980, 440,103 coconuts were harvested
and the 1/7 share of the plaintiffs stood at P13,454.50; for the period
February to December, 1981, 484,811 coconuts were harvested and plaintiffs' 1/7
share <span style="">stood </span>at P13, 105.00; for
the period February to December, 1982 408,464 were harvested and plaintiffs'
share stood at P13,280.20, and from February to October, 1983, 421,181 coconuts
were harvested <span style="">and </span>plaintiffs'
share stood at P18,844.10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
the plaintiffs' aforesaid shares is computed to only 1/7 which is equal to only
14.28% the defendants should add thereto the <span style="">sum of </span>P64<span class="GramE">,601.49</span> to make it equal to
30%." (<span style="">pp. </span>36-39, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision, petitioner Hernandez appealed to
the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1986</st1:date>, the respondent appellate court rendered a decision
affirming the trial court's judgment with the modification that the attorney's

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition is filed, with the petitioner
assigning the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"1. The
respondent appellate court committed a grave error and misapprehension of facts
when it upheld the conclusion of the trial court that the private respondents
are agricultural tenants of the petitioner in the land in question, and in not
declaring that they are not tenants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. The
respondent appellate court committed a grave error and mistaken application of
law when it finds that an agricultural leasehold system exists between the
private respondents and the petitioner."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 69, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first assigned error, petitioner argues that private
respondents are not tenants but "<span class="SpellE">bantays</span>" <span style="">or </span>watchers as stated in the letter of
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> to respondent <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
Flores; that even as "<span class="SpellE">bantays</span>," the private
respondents had already been dismissed in 1952 or 1953; that when petitioner
started to lease the property in 1957, there were no persons or houses in the
landholding; that it was in 1973 that private respondents were hired as wage
laborers to do the picking, gathering and hauling of coconuts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contentions are untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving the issue on the nature of the relationship of the
parties in the instant case, it would be well to cite the distinction between a
share tenant and an agricultural worker.</p>

<p class="BODY">Share tenancy is defined as the physical possession by a person <span style="">of </span>land devoted to agriculture,
belonging to or legally possessed by another for the purpose of production
through the labor of the former and of the members of his immediate farm
household <span style="">in </span>consideration of
which the former agrees to share the harvest with the latter or to pay <span style="">a </span>price certain or ascertainable, either
in produce or in money or in both (Section 3, R.A. 1199, Agricultural Tenancy
Act, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Share tenancy exists
whenever two persons agree on a joint undertaking for agricultural production
wherein one party furnishes the land and <span style="">the
</span>other, his labor, with either or both contributing any one or several
items of production, the tenant cultivating the land with the aid of labor
available from members of his immediate farm household, and the produce thereof
to be divided between the landholder and the tenant in proportion to their
respective contributions (Section 4, R.A. 1199; Section 166(25), R.A. 3844,
Agricultural Land Reform Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, a farmhand or agricultural worker is any
agricultural wage, salary or piece worker but is not limited to a farm worker
of a particular farm employer unless <span style="">this
</span>Code explicitly states otherwise, and any individual whose work has
ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, a current agrarian dispute
or an unfair labor practice and who has not obtained a substantially equivalent
<span style="">and </span>regular employment.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An important </span><span class="GramE">criteria</span> in determining whether <span style="">the </span>relationship is one of share tenancy is cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The meaning of cultivation concerning coconut
lands has already been spelled out by this Court as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></span><span style=""> The definition </span>of cultivation<span style=""> is </span>not limited merely to the tilling,
plowing or harrowing of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
includes the promotion of growth and the care of the plants, or husbanding the
ground to forward the products of the earth by general industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The raising of coconuts is a unique
agricultural enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike rice,
the planting of coconut seedlings does not need harrowing and plowing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Holes are merely dug on the ground of
sufficient depth and distance, the seedlings placed in the holes and the
surface thereof covered by soil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
coconut trees are planted only every thirty to a hundred years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The major work in raising coconuts begins
when the coconut trees are already fruit-bearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it is cultivated by smudging or smoking
the plantation, taking care of the coconut trees, applying <span style="">fertilizer, </span>weeding and watering,
thereby increasing the produce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that respondent Benitez, together with his family, handles all phases of <span class="SpellE">farmwork</span> from clearing the landholding to the processing of
copra, although at times with the aid of hired laborers, thereby cultivating
the land, shows that he is a tenant, not a mere farm laborer.’ <span class="GramE">(Guerrero v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-44570,
</span><st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 30, 1986</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 142 SCRA 136; Coconut Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc.

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It may thus be said that the caretaker of
an agricultural land can also be considered the cultivator of the land (<span class="SpellE">Latag</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Banog</span>, G.R. No. 20098,
January 31, 1966, 16 SCRA 88).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court and respondent appellate court arrived at the
same findings and conclusions that private respondents have been in continuous,
uninterrupted physical possession of their respective areas in the landholding,
which they have cleaned and cleared for the purpose of improving the harvests;
that they have lived in the landholding and constructed <span style="">their </span>houses thereon; that respondents
were paid in an amount equivalent to a share of one-sixth (1/6) of the harvest
during the ownership of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and then
later, one seventh (1/7) during the period of petitioner's lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">The status of respondents as tenants based on the foregoing
cannot be gainsaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where private
respondents cultivated the land and did not receive salaries but a share in the
produce or the cash equivalent of his share in lump, the relationship is one of
tenancy and not employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that respondents have huts erected on the landholding shows they are tenants
(Cruz v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 50350, May 15, 1984, 129 SCRA 222).</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, this Court has consistently ruled that <span style="">in </span>agrarian cases, all that is required
is mere substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
agrarian court's findings of fact which attained the minimum evidentiary
support demanded by law, that is, supported by substantial evidence, are final
and conclusive and cannot be reversed by the appellate tribunals (<span class="SpellE">Bagsican</span> v. Court <span style="">of
</span>Appeals, G.R. No. 62255, January 30, 1986, 141 SCRA 226).</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the second assigned error, it may be<span style=""> </span>true that the statement of respondent
appellate court that agricultural leasehold exists between the parties herein
is somehow misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, this
