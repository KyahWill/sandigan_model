<p class="BODY">This case is before us on automatic review on account of the
death penalty <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">imposed on the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version is as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crime was committed at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1978</st1:date> right in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Earlier that evening, the victim Arlington <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>
was mauled by a group of men led by a certain <span class="SpellE">Gorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balani</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rara</span> was still lying in the middle of the road when two
soldiers, in the company of some civilians who reported the incident,
arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two soldiers raised <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> up and led him to a store nearby where he could
sit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They investigated <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> about the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rara</span> could not identify his assailants as he
was not a resident of the place, so the two soldiers decided to bring <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> to their checkpoint to rest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before they could take <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> to the
checkpoint, the accused <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span>, Jr., who was then a soldier connected with the
40th Infantry Battalion and designated as Assistant Chief of the Military
Police assigned in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del Norte, arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span>
Jr. started investigating <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> could not
identify the persons who mauled him, being a stranger to the place, <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> immediately hit <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>
with the back of his left hand, Causing the latter to fall <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">to </span>the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> pulled
the victim's hair with his left hand and raised him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span>
fired his revolver at the side of <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>, but not
hitting him, and again asked him for the identity of the person who mauled
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>
could not name his attackers, <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> took off the
victim's belt and whipped him with it until its buckle was taken off.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Rara</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> knelt before <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span>
and asked forgiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That act
apparently angered <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> and he asked the victim
why he should ask for forgiveness from him when he was not God and he was not
the one who mauled him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately
after saying this to the victim who was still kneeling before him, <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> pulled his hair with his left hand and
simultaneously drew his revolver with his right hand and shot the victim
pointblank, hitting him on the neck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
victim fell down, sitting on the ground, with head bent downward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">One of the soldiers
present approached the victim and verified where he was hit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> </span>must
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">have come to his senses, for he ordered
those present to take <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> to a doctor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rara</span> was already
hovering between life and death </span>when he was brought to the clinic of Dr.
<span class="SpellE">Daranan</span>, where he died shortly thereafter despite
efforts to save his life.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The victim's cadaver was
brought to the Municipal Auditorium where it was autopsied by Dr. Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Layos</span>, the Municipal Health Officer of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Bacolod</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del

report</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> wherein he stated the following findings:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Wound bullet about 1/3 cm. diameter, edge
inward, over the anterior aspect neck, about 1 cm. below the <span class="SpellE">adam's</span> apple, on probing it is directed slightly <span class="SpellE">posteriosly</span> upward.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Powder
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">burns over </span>the exterior
aspect <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of
neck</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">According to the doctor, who <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">testified </span>at the trial, the presence
of powder burns on the neck of the victim showed that the gun <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>fired only about <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">one </span>(1) foot away by <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span>assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense was as follows: At <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1978</st1:date>, he was on patrol in the market
place of the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del Norte.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he was at the
checkpoint, a civilian reported that a person was being mauled by a group of
men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the accused was told that a
person was lying on the road, he got his service rifle (<span class="SpellE">Armalite</span>)
and proceeded to the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also
armed with a hand grenade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had no
other firearm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he was on his way to
the place where the person was allegedly mauled, the accused heard a shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By experience, he knew that the shot was from
a .22 caliber firearm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he arrived
at the place, he was informed that five persons participated in the
mauling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, a person passed at his
back and tried to assault him, so he blocked him with his <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span>
and fired a warning shot upward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another
civilian told appellant that his warning shot hit somebody and he answered that
it was impossible for him to hit anybody because he fired his shot upward with
his <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused then inspected the victim and when he saw the wound in the
neck, he ordered that the victim be brought to the clinic.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defense, the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> made the following findings: In the evening of April
23, 1978 at around 7:00 o'clock, the victim Arlington <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>,
was seen lying unconscious on the road at the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> near the house of <span class="SpellE">Pablita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mejorada</span> who informed the persons in the store of
Martin <span class="SpellE">Pumicpic</span>, who was her neighbor, about the man
lying on the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two persons, namely,
Damian <span class="SpellE">Argao</span> and Andres <span class="SpellE">Pumicpic</span>,
who were then in the store went to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">MP
</span>Detachment which was around 100 meters away to inform the soldiers of
the presence of a man lying on the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two soldiers from the detachment responded and went to the place where the
man was lying unconscious on the road and brought him to the premises of the
store of Martin <span class="SpellE">Pumicpic</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They tried to find out from the victim who
were responsible for mauling him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
answered them that he did not know.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
two army men were about to bring him to the MP Checkpoint when the accused, <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span>, Jr. arrived
at the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused was wearing
short pants and a white T-shirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> proceeded to investigate the victim <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> as to who mauled him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rara</span> could not give the identity of the person
who mauled him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After repeated
questioning by <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> and the same answer was
given by <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> that he did not know who mauled him,
the former struck the latter with the back of his left hand, causing the latter
to fall to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span> then followed this by pulling the victim's hair
up, and, taking his revolver from his waist, he fired toward the side of the
victim but not hitting him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still not
getting an answer from the victim as to who mauled him, <span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span>
then got hold of the belt of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">victim and </span>whipped him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">5 </span>times at the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim knelt before the accused and asked
forgiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alegarbes</span>
answered, "Why should you ask forgiveness from me <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">when I am not God and I was not the one who mauled you?" Then he
pulled up <span class="SpellE">Rara</span> by the hair and while doing so, he
again took his revolver from his waist and shot <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>
hitting him on the neck, below the Adam's apple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not give credence to the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
defense that the victim tried to assault him, firstly because the victim <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was already </span>groggy after having been
mauled by unknown persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the
three prosecution's eyewitnesses, namely, Damian <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>,
Andres <span class="SpellE">Pumicpic</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>, belied the claim of the accused that the victim
tried to assault him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Appellant's assigned
errors are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lower court erred in
holding the accused responsible for the death of Arlington <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>
and in convicting the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>the
crime of murder;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That, assuming the
accused to be responsible for the death of Arlington <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>,
the lower court erred in considering against the accused the qualifying
circumstance of treachery;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That, assuming the
accused to be responsible for the death of Arlington <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>,
the lower court erred in considering against the accused the ordinary aggravating
circumstances of abuse of public position and cruelty;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">4. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>That, assuming the accused to be responsible
for the death of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Arlington <span class="SpellE">Rara</span>, the lower court erred in not considering in favor of
the accused the mitigating </span>circumstances of lack of intention to commit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">so grave a wrong as </span>that committed and
voluntary surrender.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">We
find no merit in appellant's assignments of error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The court's finding that
the killing of the victim by the appellant was deliberate, intentional, cruel
and treacherous is supported by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">testimonies
of Damian <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>, Andres <span class="SpellE">Pumicpic</span>
</span>and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>,
who were eyewitnesses to the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>None of the three had reason to testify falsely against the
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court believed the
testimonies of these three witnesses, and we have no reason to disturb its
findings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the other hand,
appellant's version was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">corroborated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No witnesses, including his soldier
companions, testified </span>for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It could not be true, as alleged
by appellant, that he heard <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a </span>shot
when he was on his way to the checkpoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His version made it appear that the victim was already shot at the time
he arrived on the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, according
to the appellant, when he arrived at the scene, someone tried to attack him
from behind and he fired a warning shot upwards with his <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span>,
which probably hit the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant's version is inconsistent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Besides,
appellant's uncorroborated version cannot prevail over the testimonies of three
eyewitnesses who narrated the true version of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery was present in the killing, because the victim was not
in a position to defend himself when he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>unexpectedly shot by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unarmed, he was a helpless victim of the
senseless assault by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court likewise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">did
</span>not err in considering both aggravating circumstances of abuse of public
position and cruelty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
undoubtedly took advantage of his public position as a soldier, when he
maltreated and killed a civilian victim of mauling, whom he was supposed to
protect in the performance of his duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cruelty inflicted on the victim before the accused shot him,
boxing him, belting him with his (the victim's) own belt, threatening him by
firing his pistol in the air, is abundantly clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim was kneeling and helpless, and yet
the appellant with abuse of superior strength, consciously and deliberately did
everything to torture and intimidate him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His actuations showed the appellant to be heartless and without mercy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew that the deceased was not the
aggressor, but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span>the victim of a physical assault by unknown persons, and yet
for the flimsy reason that the victim could not identify those who mauled him,
appellant decided to turn his inexplicable ire on him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender cannot be
considered in his favor, because it is not shown that there was a spontaneous
acknowledgement by the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of his
guilt, or that he wished to save the authorities from the trouble and expense
incurred </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his capture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, appellant did not actually surrender to the police;
what he did was merely to inform the police headquarters about the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">fact, appellant tried to mislead the authorities by claiming that he
was not the one who shot the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reversible errors committed by the trial court in
finding the accused guilty of the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby
affirmed, with the modification that the penalty imposed is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
