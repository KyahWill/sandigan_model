impugns the resolution dated February 14, 1989 of Voluntary Arbitrator Alberto <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, and his order dated May 12, 1989 denying
petitioner's motion for the reconsideration thereof, in the case entitled

the case is summarized by the Solicitor General, which summary we quote with
approval, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"The case at bar concerns the complaints <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of </span>three Traffic Operators of
petitioner Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company at its <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Exchange.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Herein private respondents Ma.</span> Emma J. <span class="SpellE">Totesora</span> and <span class="SpellE">Miricar</span> A. Marcos
were regular employees who were dismissed for allegedly placing free long
distance calls from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The employment of private respondent Maria
Lourdes U. <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span>, allegedly on probationary
status was terminated on the ground that she failed to meet the minimum
requirements for permanent employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As regular Traffic Operators at petitioner's <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Office, it was the main function of respondents <span class="SpellE">Totesora</span> and Marcos to process long distance calls.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that, on different dates, said
respondents were caught passing free long distance calls to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asked to explain, Ms. <span class="SpellE">Totesora</span>
stated that it was not altogether a free call; that she just allowed the
parties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>talk a little longer
without timing the entire <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">call.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>For her part, Ms. Marcos admitted
placing a free call to her <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">brot</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>h)<span class="SpellE">er</span> in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
whom she had not heard of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">for </span>some
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding their explanations
unsatisfactory, <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> terminated their
services.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to respondent <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span>,
petitioner claimed that she was employed by the Company effective <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1986</st1:date> as probationary Traffic
Operator at its <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Exchange; that her probationary
status was for three months; that Ms. <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span>
failed to meet the minimum requirement for regularization; that as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>result thereof, her employment was
terminated effective <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ms. <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span>, on
the other hand, claimed that she worked continuously for petitioner from April
1985 to <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1986</st1:date>,
and that, consequently, she should have been regularized long before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, her termination from the service was
illegal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> to which the dismissed
employees belong and <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> agreed in
writing to submit their dispute to voluntary arbitration and be bound by the
decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">After hearing, Voluntary
Arbitrator <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> issued the assailed resolution
which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A. - On the issue of the validity of the
dismissal of Ma.</span> Emma <span class="SpellE">Totesora</span> and Ms. <span class="SpellE">Miricar</span> Marcos - In my personal observation based on the
records submitted<span class="GramE">,</span> I found Ms. <span class="SpellE">Totesora</span>
and Ms. Marcos to have violated company regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it is my opinion, that outright
dismissal is too drastic for a first offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I recommended, instead, a transfer of assignment in the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This arrangement, I believe, is a good
compromise considering that while the company is for outright dismissal of the
employees concerned, the union is asking for the return of the said employees
to their original positions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"B. - On the legality of the termination of the probationary
employment of Ms. Maria Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span> - I cannot
understand why the company waited for a year before they decided that Ms. <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span> should undergo probationary employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records showed that she was employed
since April 1985 and yet she did not undergo probationary employment until <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I also noted that during her employment for
that period there were no serious complaints about her performance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Personally, I find <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the </span>delay of the probation period unusual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of this dilemma I believe that
justice and fair play can only be attained by retaining Ms. <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span>
as an employee but not necessarily as a traffic operator."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
