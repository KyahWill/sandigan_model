Sheriff of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> levied on a motor vehicle, with Plate No.
PUJ-343-64, regis­tered in the name of <span class="SpellE">VIDAD</span>, and

Sheriff alleging actual owner­ship of the motor vehicle levied upon, and
stating that registration thereof in the name of <span class="SpellE">VIDAD</span>
was merely to enable </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">SANTOS</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> to make use of <span class="SpellE">VIDAD's</span> Certificate of Public
Convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the third-party
complaint was filed, <span class="SpellE">SIBUG</span> submitted to the Sheriff a
bond issued by the Philippine Surety Insur­ance Company (THE BONDING COMPANY,
for short), to save the Sheriff from liability if he were to proceed with the
sale and if SANTOS' third-party claim should be ultimately upheld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Injunction with a prayer for Preliminary Mandatory Injunction against <span class="SpellE">SIBUG</span>; <span class="SpellE">VIDAD</span>; and the Sheriff in
Civil Case No. 56842 of </span><i><span style="">Branch
X</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">of the same Court of First Instance of Manila
(hereinafter referred to as the BRANCH X CASE).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint was later amended to include the BONDING COMPANY as a
party defendant although its bond had not become effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Complaint, SANTOS alleged essential­ly
that he was the actual owner of the motor vehicle subject of levy; that a
fictitious Deed of Sale of said motor vehicle was executed by him in <span class="SpellE">VIDAD's</span> favor for purposes of operating said vehicle as a
passenger <span class="SpellE">jeep­ney</span> under the latter's franchise; that
SANTOS did not receive any payment from <span class="SpellE">VIDAD</span> in
consideration of said sale; that to protect SANTOS' proprietary interest </span>over
the vehicle in question, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">VIDAD</span></span><span style=""> </span>in
turn had executed a Deed of Sale in favor of SANTOS on June 27, 1962; that
SANTOS was not a party in the BRANCH XVII CASE and was not in any manner liable
to the registered owner <span class="SpellE"><span style="">VIDAD</span></span><span style=""> </span>and
the driver <span class="SpellE">Gragas</span>; that SANTOS derived a daily income
<span style="">of</span><span style=""> </span>P<span style="">3</span>0.00 from the
operation <span style="">of </span>said<span style=""> </span>motor vehicle as a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeep­ney</span> and <span style="">stood </span>to
suffer irrepar<span style="">a</span>ble damage if
posses­sion of said motor vehicle <span style="">w</span>ere
not restored to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SANTOS then prayed
that <span style="">1) </span>pending trial, a Writ of
Preliminary Mandatory Injunction be issued <i>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></i>
commanding the Sheriff of Manila to restore the motor vehicle to him and that
the Sheriff be enjoined from proceeding with its sale; 2) that, after trial,
the Deed of Sale in favor of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">VIDAD</span></span><span style=""> </span>be
declared absolutely fictitious and, therefore, null and void, and adjudg­ing
SANTOS to be the absolute owner of the vehicle in question; and 3) that damages
be awarded to SANTOS as proven during the trial plus attorney's fees in the
amount of P450.00 and costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span>The Sheriff has the right to continue with the public sale on his own

him.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As said in <span class="SpellE">Uy-Piaoco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, 9 Phil.
299, 307, "the powers of the Sheriff invol</span><span style="">v</span><span style="">e both discretional
power and personal liability." The men­tioned discretional power and
personal liability have been further elucidated in <span class="SpellE">Planas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Verdon</span> vs. Madrigal &amp; Co., et al., 94 Phil.
754, where it was held.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The duty of the sheriff in connection with the execution and <span style="">sa</span>tisfaction of judgment of the court<span style=""> </span>is governed <span style="">by </span>Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 15 thereof <span style="">provides for </span>the procedure <span style="">to
</span>be followed where the property levied on execution is claimed by a third
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the third-party <span style="">claim is sufficient, the sheriff, upon
receiving it, is not bound to proceed with the levy of the property, unless he
is given by the judgment creditor an indemnity bond against the claim (<span class="SpellE">Mangaoang</span> vs. Provincial Sheriff, 91 Phil., 368).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the sheriff may proceed with the
levy even without the indemnity bond, but in such case he will answer for any
damages with his own personal funds (Waite vs. Peterson, et al., 8 Phil., 419; <span class="SpellE">Alzua</span>, et al. vs. Johnson, 21 Phil., 308; <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span> No. 341 de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">abogados</span> de Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 48 Phil., 565).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the rule also provides that nothing
therein contained shall prevent a third person from vindicating his claim to
the property by any proper action (Sec. 15 of Rule 39)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears from the above
that if the attaching creditor should furnish an adequate bond, the Sheriff has
to proceed with the public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
such bond </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not filed, then the Sheriff shall decide whe­ther
to proceed, or to desist from proceeding, with the public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he decides to proceed, he will incur
personal liability in favor of the success­ful third-party claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment in the BRANCH X CASE appears to be quite legally
unpalatable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, since the
undertaking furnished to the Sheriff by the BONDING COMPANY did not become
effective for the reason that the jeep was not sold, the public sale thereof
having been restrained, there was no reason for promulgating judgment against
the BONDING COMPANY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has also been
noted that the Complaint against <span class="SpellE">VIDAD</span> was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Most important of all, the judgment against <span class="SpellE">SIBUG</span>
was inequitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In asserting his rights
of ownership to the vehicle in question, <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>
candid­ly admitted his participation in the illegal and pernicious practice in
the transportation business known as the <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">kabit</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 20 (g) of the Public Service Act, then
the applicable law, specifically provided:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> it shall
be unlawful for any public service or for the owner, lessee or operator thereof,
without the approval and authorization of the Commission previously had--- x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (g) to sell, alienate,
mortgage, encumber or lease its property, franchise, certificates, privileges,
or rights, or any part thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case, <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>
had fictitiously sold the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to <span class="SpellE">VIDAD</span>, who had become the registered owner and operator of
record at the time of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is <span style="">true that <span class="SpellE">VIDAD</span>
had executed a re-sale to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">SANTOS</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, but the </span>document <span style="">was

and grantee of the franchise, is directly and primarily responsible and liable
for the damages caused to <span class="SpellE">SIBUG</span>, the injured party,
as a consequence of the negligent or careless operation of the vehicle.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This ruling is based on the principle that </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">operator of record is considered the operator of the vehicle in
contemplation of law as regards the public and third persons</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> even if the vehicle involved in the accident

For the same basic reason, as the vehicle here in question was registered in <span class="SpellE">VIDAD's</span> name, the levy on execution against said vehicle
should be enforced so that the judgment in the BRANCH XVII CASE may be
satisfied, <span style="">notwithstanding </span>the
fact that the secret ownership of the vehicle belonged to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>,

separate action under Section 17 of Rule 39.<span style="">&nbsp;

rendered the judgment, to enforce which the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>

property must be one in which the defendant has proprietary interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the Sheriff seizes a stranger's
