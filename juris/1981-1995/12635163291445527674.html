				<H3>RE: REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT BRANCHES 61, 134 AND 147, MAKATI, METRO MANILA. <br /><br />[A.M. NO. P-93-944]<br /><br />ATTY. INOCENCIO E.

				<BR><STRONG>REGALADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These consolidated administrative matters originated from a spot Audit of Branches 61, 134 and 147 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, conducted by a team from the office of the Court Administrator headed by Atty. Nicandro Cruz.<br><br>On February 3, 1993, the said audit team submitted a report with the following findings:<br><br>1.&nbsp; As of October 31, 1992, Branch 134, presided by Judge Ignacio M. Capulong, has 25 unresolved cases submitted for decision/resolution beyond the 90-day period; 17 of which are criminal cases.&nbsp; However, only 8 of these cases were totally tried by Judge Capulong, the rest having been partly heard by his predecessor or which he inherited.&nbsp; None of the criminal cases involve detention prisoners.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Branch 147 presided by Judge Teofilo Guadiz, Jr., on the other hand, only has one criminal case submitted for decision beyond the 90-day period; and this also involves no detention prisoners.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the cases submitted for decision/resolution in Branch 61, presided by Judge Fernando V. Gorospe, Jr., are within the reglementary period.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worth mentioning that the monthly reports for October, 1992 submitted by Branches 134 and 147 to the (S)tatistics Division of the Court do not reflect the actual number of cases submitted for decision in their respective salas.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The team has also discovered several criminal cases where no action has been taken for a considerable length of time; which cases, fortunately, do not involve detention prisoners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to said findings, this Court issued a resolution, dated March 9, 1993, requiring the following judges and their respective branch clerks of court to explain, within ten (10) days from notice, why no administrative sanctions should be imposed on them for the following reasons:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Ignacio M. Capulong for his failure to resolve Criminal Cases Nos. 90-5620, 91-2373, 23275, 8473, 8753, 0772, 8336, 5496, 31474, 5702, 90-1029, 90-1032, 3100, 2298, 88-851 to 88-853 inclusive and Civil Cases Nos. 102, 1412, 3214, 5950, 6417, 5681, 10014 and 7693 beyond the 90-day reglementary period;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Capulong and his Branch Clerk of Court for their failure to take further action on Criminal Cases Nos. 13251, 1245, 6681, 0395 and 88-4375 for unreasonable length of time;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Teofilo Guadiz, Jr. for his failure to resolve Criminal Case No. 88-1193 beyond the 90-day reglementary period; and<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Guadiz and his Branch Clerk of Court for their failure to take further action on Criminal Cases Nos. 91-2353 to 91-2357 inclusive, 91-3665 and 91-3987 for an unreasonable length of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>By way of compliance with the aforementioned resolution, Judge Capulong, Presiding Judge of Branch 134, Regional Trial Court of Makati submitted his written explanations on June 2, 1993<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and additional explanations in his Compliance, dated April 19, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> His Branch Clerk of Court, Atty.

Dumlao, wherein it was stated that the reason for his failure to take further action on specified criminal cases for an unreasonable length of time was the alleged <i>de facto </i>takeover of the management and control of the controversial cases by the Court's stenographic reporter, Susan Quinto, and Deputy Sheriff Pioquinto Villapaña, and the "non-juicy cases" were left unacted upon, we resolved on August 3, 1993 to (1) recall the resolution of July 8, 1993 insofar as the resignation of Stenographer Susan Quinto is concerned and pending the outcome of this case, hold in abeyance whatever benefits may be due her on account of her resignation; (2) treat Atty. Dumlao's Supplemental Explanation as an administrative complaint against Stenographer Quinto and Sheriff Villapaña, to be docketed as A.M. No. P-93-944, and direct them to comment on the matter; and (3) consolidate A.M.

Capulong and Atty. Inocencio M. Dumlao.</i><br><br><b>A.&nbsp; ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER AGAINST JUDGE CAPULONG:</b><br><br><ol><li>&nbsp;Judge Capulong failed to justify his failure to decide four (4) cases, to wit: Criminal Cases Nos. 90-5620, 23275, 90-1029, and 90- 1032, within 90 days from date of submission. x x x:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 90-5620 - People vs. Carlos Macaraeg (page 5)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Judge Capulong merely depended on the clerk-in-charge to report to him if the transcripts are already completely submitted and to place the complete records on his desk.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Judge Capulong had no list of cases that should be decided within the 90-day period and did not conduct periodical inventories; otherwise, he would have known about the lapse of the 90-day period and he would have taken the proper course of action which is to request extension from the Supreme Court within which to decide the case.<br></div></div><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 23275 - People vs. Rodolfo Tirador (pages 5-6)<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Judge Capulong's explanation that he was waiting for the presentation of rebuttal evidence of the prosecution is not borne by the records.&nbsp; As admitted by him during the investiga­tion, there is no order found in the records stating that the prosecution will present rebuttal evidence.<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Judge Capulong's further explana­tion that he was waiting for the completion of the transcripts and the submission thereof together with the records on his desk by the clerk-in-­charge does not justify the delay in rendering the decision.&nbsp; Again, it shows disregard or lack of knowledge of the above-quoted circulars.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 90-1029 - People vs. Emiliano Brosas Mancilla (page 6)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The belated rendition of judgment does not justify the negligence of Judge Capulong in his failure to decide the case within the 90-day period.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 90-1032 - People vs. Renato Olalo (pages 6-7)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The explanation of Judge Capulong that the clerk must have failed to place the records of the case on his desk does not exonerate him from his duty to decide the case within the 90-day period from date of submission, or, to request the Supreme Court (for) an extension of time within which to decide the case.<br><br>The admission of Judge Capulong that he does not keep a list of cases sub­mitted to him for decision indicates lack of knowledge of or a disregard of Administrative Circular No. 1 as quoted above.<br></div><br></li><li>In fourteen (14) cases, to wit: Criminal Cases Nos. 0772, 8473, 8336, 31474, 5702, 3100, 2298; and Civil Cases Nos. 102, 3214, 5681, 1412, 5950, 7693 and 6417, compliance with the 90-day period within which to decide them cannot be imposed on Judge Capulong for the reason that they were all heard before and submitted to the previous presiding Judge of Branch 134.</li></ol><br><b>HOWEVER, THE HEREIN INVESTIGATOR HAS OBSERVED CONSTANT/REPEATED/PATENT NEGLI­GENCE IN </b><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF JUDGE CAPULONG'S BASIC DUTIES CAUSING UNDUE DELAY IN THE DISPENSATION OF JUSTICE IN SAID 14 CASES WHICH COULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED AS THEY CONSTITUTE CLEAR VIOLATION OR DISREGARD OF RULE 3.08 AND RULE 3.09, CANON 3 OF THE CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, x x x:</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 8473 - People vs. Bien Perez (pages 7-9 hereof)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of Judge Capulong to go over the records of the case before issuing the order declaring the case as an inherited case and forwarding the records to the JPDIO only to be returned because of lack of transcripts and the prosecution has not formally offered its exhi­bits, constitute negligence causing undue delay in the resolution of the case.<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of Judge Capulong to comply with Memorandum Circular No. 2-89 as herein above-quoted caused undue delay.&nbsp; It took the Judge more than 3 years to refer the case to the JPDIO.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">c)&nbsp;&nbsp; The erroneous act of Judge Capulong in ordering the case to be archived upon receipt of the records return­ed by the JPDIO, instead of completing the transcript and directing the prosecution to formally offer its evidence with due notice to the accused likewise constitutes negligence or failure to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family; and a disregard of Memorandum Circular No. 2-89.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Capulong's unwarranted (to the point of being irrational and irresponsible) reliance on his Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Dumlao, who prepared both orders, forward­ing the incomplete records of the case to the JPDIO and later on unreasonably archiving the case, by signing said orders without ascer­taining whether their contents are in accordance with the records of the case.&nbsp; A simple examination of the records by Judge Capulong before signing the erroneous orders prepared by Atty. Dumlao could have prevented further unnecessary delay in the disposition of said case.<br></div></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">2)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 8336 - People vs. Elmina delos Reyes (page 9)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The same inaction on the part of Judge Capulong as in paragraph 1 b) above.&nbsp; The case was forwarded only to the JPDIO on March 5, 1993, or almost four (4) years after the issuance of Memorandum Circular No. 2-89.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">3)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 0772 - People vs. Renato Ibabao (pages 10-11)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp; The same inaction on the part of Judge Capulong as in paragraphs 1b) and 2 above. The case was sub­mitted for decision in 1985 before Judge Capulong assumed office as presiding Judge of Branch 134.&nbsp; It was forwarded to JPDIO only on March 5, 1993 but the evidence was incomplete prompting the JPDIO to return the records to Branch 134.<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The same erroneous order of archiv­ing the case instead of completing the evidence.<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; The same unjustified absolute re­liance of Judge Capulong on Atty. Dumlao in signing the inaccurate/erroneous orders pre­pared by Atty. Dumlao despite the fact that he (Judge Capulong) has been forewarned of the questionable activities of Atty. Dumlao (TSN, Hearing of April 20, 1994, pp. 31-32, 49-50; pages 34-35 hereof).<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">4)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 31474 - People vs. Felipe Matoza (pages 11-15)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Capulong committed the same negligence as in the above Criminal Cases Nos. 8473, 8336 and 0772.&nbsp; The case was returned by the JPDIO to Branch 134 because four exhibits were missing and Atty. Dumlao failed to submit the same despite having been ordered to do so by Judge Fortun of the JPDIO.<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of Judge Capulong to examine the records before signing the order prepared by Atty. Dumlao archiving the case, instead of ordering the submission of the four (4) missing exhibits or to conduct proper investigation as to their whereabouts, to complete the records of the case, constitutes negligence.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">5)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 5702 - People vs. David Gambez (page 15)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Judge Capulong committed the same negligence as in the above Criminal Cases Nos. 8473, 8336, 0792 and 31474.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">6)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 3100 - People vs. Roger Ponio (pages 9-10)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The same failure of Judge Capulong to submit his inventory of inherited cases to JPDIO within the period required (or at least within a reason­able time) under Memorandum Circular No. 2-89 as quoted above.&nbsp; It was only on March 5, 1993 that Judge Capulong forwarded this case to the JPDIO or a lapse of more than three years.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">7)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 2298 - People vs. Nestor Cortez (pages 15-17)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Capulong was negligent when he failed to conduct physical inventory of the cases assigned to Branch 134 upon his assumption to office as presiding Judge thereof on January 10, 1986; otherwise, he would have noticed that the prose­cution has not filed its motion to dismiss;<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The same failure of Judge Capulong to go over the records of the case before signing the order prepared by Atty. Dumlao considering the case as an inherited case when the evidence for the prosecution has not been admitted by the court and there was no resolution on the motion to dismiss, constitutes negligence;<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; The erroneous act of Judge Capulong in archiving the case on the above-stated ground instead of dismissing the case for lack of interest to prosecute shows disregard of Memo­randum Circular No. 7-92.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">8)&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the seven (7) civil cases, to wit: Civil Case No. 102 - Polaris Mar­keting Corp. vs. Welhelm Javelona, et al.

(page 23) ?<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Judge Capulong:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to set up an effective system whereby all motions filed by litigants should be brought to his attention for proper action which constitutes a disregard of Rules 3.08 and 3.09, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to comply with Memorandum Circular No. 2-89 by ordering the Branch Clerk of Court to forward the records of the case to the JPDIO more than 3 years after the issuance of said circular.<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to see to it that his instructions and orders have been followed by Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Dumlao.&nbsp; Until the date of investigation on May 26, 1994, the records of the abovementioned civil cases with the exception of Civil Cases Nos. 1412, 5650 and 6417, have not been transmitted to the JPDIO.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to the report of the Judicial Audit, four (4) cases, to wit: Criminal Cases Nos. 88-851, 88-852, 88-853 and Civil Case No. 10014, are not yet actually ready for decision but their dispositions are unduly delayed and therefore both Judge Capulong and Atty. Dumlao should be held answerable therefor:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Criminal Cases Nos. 88-851, 88-852 and 88-853 which were jointly tried - People vs. Teresita Estrada<br></div><br>No sufficient explanation was given by Judge Capulong or by Atty. Dumlao why no action had been taken after Judge Capulong set the case for reception of defense evidence on October 4, 1991.&nbsp; Nothing else transpired until a notice of hearing was sent by Atty. Dumlao on June 1, 1993 without any court order.<br><br>Judge Capulong failed to conduct bi-annual inventory to ascertain the status of each case pending trial as required in Administrative Cir­cular No. 1.&nbsp; If he had done so, he would have been apprised of the status of the cases and they would not have suffered undue delay in the termination of the trial on the merits.<br><br>Judge Capulong failed to exercise the ordi­nary diligence of a good father of a family in supervising over the work of Atty. Dumlao who could not offer any explanation why a notice of hearing was sent by him when there is no order attached to the records of the case; and why the case did not move at all from October, 1991 to August, 1993, the date he (Atty. Dumlao) was detailed to RTC Valenzuela.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil Case No. 10014 - Crown Motor Sales Corp. vs. Luz P. Medel and her husband (pages 24-25)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="margin-left: 40px;">This case should have been includ­ed with the five cases wherein Judge Capulong and Atty. Dumlao were required to explain.<br></div><br>Again, this involves the same omission of Judge Capulong and Atty. Dumlao to conduct an inventory regularly as required by the Supreme Court circular; otherwise, had they exercised due diligence in the performance of their duties, they would have discovered in due time that defendant's motion to lift order of default filed on November 5, 1985 had not been acted upon.<br></div><br><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER AGAINST JUDGE CAPULONG AND ATTY. DUMLAO INVOLVING 5 CASES, to wit: </b>CRIMINAL CASES NOS. 13251; 1245; 6681; 0395; and 88-4375 FOR FAILURE TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION FOR UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF TIME.<br><br>Judge Capulong and Atty. Dumlao are guilty of negligence in the performance of their re­spective duties.&nbsp; They failed to justify the undue delay suffered by said cases.<br><br>Insofar as Judge Capulong is concerned, he depended/relied too much on Atty. Dumlao, the Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 134, RTC, Makati.&nbsp; Instead of verifying the records to find out if the contents of the orders are true, Judge Capulong blindly signed the orders prepared by Atty. Dumlao which were patently erroneous as what happened also in Civil Cases Nos. 8473 (page 7); 0772 (page 10); 31474 (page 11); 5702 (page 15); 2298 (page 15).<br><br>Insofar as Atty. Dumlao is concerned, he is guilty of gross negligence tantamount to bad faith in the preparation of the orders signed by Judge Capulong and in his failure to assist in the preparation of the inventories required under Administrative Circular No. 1, Circular No. 13 and Administrative Circular No. 28, herein above-quoted.&nbsp; As Branch Clerk of Court, he has the following duties towards the court and the presiding judge, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>"Under the direction of the Pre­siding Judge, he exercises supervi­sion and control over the personnel of a particular branch of the court; performs the duties and functions of a Clerk of Court within the branch; keeps the records and seal of the Court; <b>examines records of all cases filed and calendared; issues court processes; </b>administers oaths; issues certificates of appearance and indorsement for signature of the Judge; acts as Administrative Officer of the branch; <b>prepares judicial and administrative reports </b>and signs and submits daily time records of employees; requisitions equipment, supplies and materials and assumes custody of the same; acts as the Clerk of Court or the Assistant Clerk of Court in their absence when so designated; and does related tasks."</blockquote><br>Atty. Dumlao at first denied dictating to stenographers or preparing orders to be signed by Judge Capulong.&nbsp; Subsequently, after OIC Murao testified that he (Atty. Dumlao) dictates orders to stenographers and affixes his initials on each order dictated by him, Atty. Dumlao claimed that he did not make the orders without specific instructions from the judge. Judge Capulong vehemently denied giving specific instructions to Atty. Dumlao in the preparation of said orders and instead asserted that the erroneous orders described above were submitted to him already in final form.<br><br>Atty. Dumlao, in reply to the question of herein Investigator even refused to admit that he had any obligation or duty to examine the records of the case before he initiated the orders to be signed by Judge Capulong; and yet, he is fully aware of his duties as Branch Clerk of Court which are quoted in his "Reply to the Comment filed by Stenographic Reporter Susan B. Quinto" filed by him on April 11, 1994 (p. 122, Vol. II, Records).<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 13251 - People vs. Andrade (page 25)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Atty. Dumlao is negligent in preparing an Order dated March 5, 1993 declaring the case as an inherited case when in fact there is a motion to dismiss filed by the accused on February 14, 1986 which remain­ed unresolved.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 1245 - People vs. Oba (page 27)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Had not the records been examined by the Judicial Audit Team of the Office of the Court Administrator in November, 1992 and the inaction brought to the attention of both Judge Capulong and Atty. Dumlao, the case would not have been sent to the JPDIO and the case decided. Judge Capulong and Atty. Dumlao are still responsible for the undue delay caused to the case considering that they referred the case to the JPDIO only in 1993 or more than 3 years after the Supreme Court has issued Memoran­dum Circular No. 2-89.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 6681 - People vs. Ibañez (page 28); and 0395 - People vs. Bandil (page 28).<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">In both cases, Atty. Dumlao prepared the orders, both dated March 5, 1993, sign­ed by Judge Capulong declaring the cases as inherited when in fact Judge Capulong still had to resolve the formal offer of evidence submitted by the prosecution together with the counsel's opposition thereto; <b>and accused had not been given the opportunity to present evidence.&nbsp; </b>No sufficient expla­nation was given for their negligence.<br><br>Their negligence is compounded by the issuance of the orders dated May 3, 1993 sending the records to the archives.&nbsp; This act is a total disregard of Administrative Circular No. 7-92 dated October 12, 1992 which prohibits indiscriminate archiving of cases without any justifiable reason therefor.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 88-4375 - People vs. Cruz (page 30)<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Judge Capulong and Atty. Dumlao are both guilty of negligence and in disregard­ing the Circular No. 7-92 when Atty. Dumlao prepared and Judge Capulong signed the Order dated March 10, 1993 archiving the case upon failure of the public prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss within 10 days from June 5, 1991.<br></div></div><br><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.M. No. P-93-944.</b><br><br>This administrative case came into being only because of Atty. Dumlao's defense in his written explanations that he was stripped of his duties as Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 134 and reduced to a mere clerk because of the alleged powerful tandem of ex-deputy sheriff Villapaña and stenographer Quinto who purportedly ipso facto acted in all the cases in Branch 134.&nbsp; Consequently, herein Investi­gator limited herself to the question (of) whether or not Atty. Dumlao was really stripp­ed of all his duties as Branch Clerk of Court; and if in the affirmative, he should be excul­pated from failing to take further action on the five cases earlier discussed under para­graph B above.<br><br>The herein Investigator sees no reason to discard the testimony of Judge Capulong on this matter, as quoted in pages 34-35 hereof.&nbsp; There is no real "administrative aberration" insofar as the performance of the regular duties of Atty. Dumlao is concerned.&nbsp; All the records still go through him (Atty.

This requirement is intended to ascertain that the trial judge duly complies with the period for deciding cases as mandated by the Constitution and the Judiciary Act.&nbsp; Hence, it decidedly does not speak well of a judge to treat that official or public document with such sarcastic disdain, which by his own supercilious admission he considered as a mere formality and was signed by him without even bothering to verify the truth of the facts he certified as correct. When he submitted the same to this Court, that enabled him to receive his salary but he definitely will not receive its benediction.&nbsp; For, a judge who falsifies his certificate of service is administratively liable for serious misconduct and inefficiency under the Rules of Court and likewise criminally liable under the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>His total reliance on respondent Dumlao may possibly be true but that does not constitute a possible ground for his complete exoneration.&nbsp; He cannot be unaware that falsification of an official or public document can be committed by reckless imprudence and even if no damage was caused thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It is the impairment of public confidence in these documents which the law seeks to repress and, indeed, it would be a highly dangerous doctrine and precedent if public officers were to espouse the same attitudinal view of respondent Judge Capulong.<br><br>At all events, we are inclined to grant Judge Capulong the conventional benefit of the doubt since, after all, good faith may be presumed.&nbsp; Respondent judge pleads pressure of work by way of exculpation, citing the existing case load and continuing infusion of additional cases into the branch he presided over.&nbsp; It does not appear that he was privy to the questionable actuations of respondent Dumlao and it is an accepted legal principle that one's culpability or responsibility should not be judged in the light of subsequent events.&nbsp; Withal, while his negligent conduct may be considered as only simple imprudence, hence not within the pale of our jurisprudence on falsification, it nevertheless amounts to gross misconduct in our catalogue of administrative offenses.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; In her aforesaid report on these administrative matters, and consequent to her conclusions quoted in the earlier portion of this decision, Justice Martinez submits the following recommendations:<br><br><ol><li>In view of the repeated negligence and disregard of or non-compliance with the circulars of the Supreme Court causing undue delay in the disposition of twenty-seven (27) cases (pls. see pages 5, 7, 23 and 25) but having in mind that the negligence was not due to any other consideration, monetary or otherwise, it is respectfully recommended that <b>Judge Ignacio M.
