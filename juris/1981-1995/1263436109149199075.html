				G.R. No. 100736, September 30, 1993</h4>
				<H3>DYNE-SEM ELECTRONICS CORPORA­TION, PETITIONER, VS.
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COM­MISSION AND NOEMA CODERA, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>NARVASA, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner, Dyne-Sem Electronics Corporation (hereafter,
simply Dyne-Sem), is engaged in the manufacture of high-technology electronic
components.  The private respondent,
Noema Codera, was employed by it as a lead-bond operator assigned to the
plastic front line section.  The issue
in this special civil action of <i>certiorari </i>is whether or not the public
respondent gravely abused its discretion in adjudging that Dyne-Sem had no just
cause to terminate Noema Codera's employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that on September 17, 1988 Codera reported for
work at 6:00 in the morning and proceeded to do some work at the company's 3rd
Optical Station.  She was then assigned
to work on the so-called "1419 Machine No. 30," to bond quantities of
"Supertex 20 lead dice" with gold wire.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, Dyne-Sem alleges that there were two (2) lots of lead dice
to be bonded with two different types of gold wire, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Lot No. 1 -  consisting of 713 units, technically
referred to as Wafer Lot #86115.01, device HV 1514P, to be bonded with a1.0 <i>mil
gold wire;</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Lot No. 2 - consisting
of 394 units, technically referred to as Wafer Lot #861155.02, device HV 1316P,
to be bonded with a1.5 <i>mil gold wire."</i><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Codera however asserts that there was only one (1) lot assigned
to her, that first described (as Lot No. 1 above).  According to her, when she began bonding the lead dice assigned
to her on the machine (No. 30) at 7:00 o'clock she found the machine to be
somewhat out of order.  Nevertheless, it
seems she was able to bond some units of the lot satisfactorily, because two
quality inspectors came by, examined her work, and said nothing.  Codera had the machine repaired, and resumed
bonding of the lot of lead dice at 7:40 o'clock.  She says she completed the bonding of the units in this lot with
1.0 millimeter gold wire according to the required specifications at 9:40
o'clock after which, following standard procedure, she prepared a time ticket
and recorded therein the work done on that particular lot and its progress.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Her time ticket reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"0700H<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bonder Codera assigned to bond 86115.05 (qty. =

<blockquote>0940 - 1000H<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Material
Downtime</blockquote>

<blockquote>1000 - 1030H<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Breaktime</blockquote>

<blockquote>1030 - 1345H<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Material
Downtime."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Codera claims that after she had prepared her time ticket, as
aforestated, she left Machine No. 30 because she was recalled to do bonding and
inspection work at the 3rd Optical Station; and that nothing unusual transpired
thereafter until she went home at the end of her shift at 2:00 o'clock in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dyne-Sem's reconstruction of the events, hereunder described, is
quite different.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rosalinie de Padua, a Supervisor of Dyne-Sem who regularly
reports for work following Noema Cordera's shift, noted the entry in the
latter's time ticket that machine No. 30 was on a <i>"material downtime
status,"</i> a term meaning simply that <i>there are no units available to
be worked on.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This connoted that work on or processing of the lots assigned to Codera had
already been completed on said machine No. 30 and hence, there were no longer
"units available to be worked on." But this was inconsistent with
another record being kept by Dyne-Sem respecting the work being done by its
employees -- called a "tracking record on whyteboard" -- in which Lot
#86115.02 (Lot No. 2) still appeared under the column <i>"for
bonding." </i>So, de Padua instructed three employees<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>to look for Lot 2 in the company
premises, being fully aware that the missing units could not have been removed
from the premises of the company because its security system included machines
that would detect any attempt at such removal.  The employees were unable to find it.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> This
aroused de Padua's suspicions that something had gone wrong with the lot, that
there had been a "misprocessing" thereof.  Those suspicions deepened when she also observed that on yet
another record -­ "the wire pull monitor record" -- "there was
nothing which showed (that) the 1.5 wire<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>was used."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> De
Padua entered her suspicions in the log book, on September 19, 1988.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, September 20, three (3) frames (each encasing
a set of units) of the missing lot -- Lot No. 2, assigned to Noema Codera --
were found inside a cabinet in the third floor of the company's plant.  Another frame was found on September 22,
1988; and on September 28 and 29, twenty-five (25) more frames were found
inside another area (the Mold Area) of the plant, mixed among "dummy
frames," i.e., rejected units or units not electrically charged.  All strips in the frames were marked with
ink as "rejects" and all dice were dotted also with ink to make them
appear as "ink dice," i.e., frames or dice rejected by customers
after testing.  The marking was done
superficially, with a whiteboard pen, and could easily be removed or
erased.  And, although the units
pertaining to this Lot No. 2 were supposed to be bonded with 1.5 gold wire, as
aforestated,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
they were found by Alex Domingo, Dyne-Sem Manager, to have been "bonded
with 1.0 mil. wire, * * (and the ) bond sequence was similar to that of (Lot
No. 1)."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Supertex, the foreign client interested in the
processing of Lot No. 2, had been inquiring about this particular lot and had
"even threatened to do something drastic, including pulling out its
business ** if Lot No. 2 was not found and processed."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing findings led Noema Codera's superiors came to
conclude that there had indeed been a "misprocessing" by her
(Codera), and that she had sought to prevent discovery of this misdeed not only
by hiding the "misprocessed" units of Lot No. 2, but also by
destroying the time ticket she had initially prepared after completing work on
Lot No. 1 -- bonding with 1.0 millimeter wire -- and drawing up an entirely new
one, which made no reference whatever to Lot No. 2 and which, as already
stated, reads as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Codera was thus asked to explain what appeared to be the
"gross violation of the company rules she had committed in connection with
the misprocessing of Lot No. 2,"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> her
acts being more specifically set out as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">"1.  Misprocessing --
wrong use of wire, 1.0 mil. instead of required 1.5 mil. was used.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.  You did not inform

<p class="NUM">4.  You falsified the
entries in your time ticket of September 17, 1988 to hide the fact that you
processed that lot.</p>

others and hid/destroyed the accompanying travel card of the lot."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These charges Codera denied, in a letter sent to Dyne-Sem's
Personnel Department on September 30, 1988.  In the letter, she asserted that she had not worked on Lot No. 2 at all;
that had there been a misprocessing she would have definitely informed her
Junior Supervisor, who should have read the travel card indicating the specific
bonding wire required; that, in any event, the frames could be re-bonded by her
if so instructed.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A formal inquiry was then scheduled and held on October 3, 1988
at which Dyne-Sem's Personnel Manager, Victor Luis S. Galvez, presided.  Codera was present, having been notified
thereof, accompanied and assisted by Amado Palillo, the Executive
Vice-President of the Dyne-Sem Employees Union, of which she was a member.  Also in attendance were some managers and
supervisors of Dyne-Sem.  At that
investigation, Manager Alex Domingo presented "the details of the
missing/mutilated Supertex 20L units with Wafer Lot #8611502," including
evidence that, among other things, said Lot #861155.02 was on the work counter
of the latter's machine (No. 30) at 9:43 a.m. of September 17, 1988.  Codera, for her part, denied either seeing
or processing said Lot No. 2.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> The
union representative who accompanied her at this meeting, A. Palillo,
"opined that the loss/mutilation of the units could not have been
committed by Ms. Codera alone and that others were involved."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After consideration of the evidence, Dyne-Sem concluded that
Norma Codera was guilty of the accusations against her -- serious misconduct,
gross negligence, falsification of documents, i.e., misprocessing of the wafer
lot, falsification of her time ticket and, "in party with others,"
hiding the misprocessed frames and marking them "with ink to simulate
reject units/frames" -- dismissed her from employment, notifying her of
her discharge through a letter of Personnel Manager Galvez dated October 5,
1988.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Codera and the Dyne-Sem Employees Union thereupon filed with the
Labor Arbiter a complaint for illegal dismissal against Dyne-Sem.  In the position paper subsequently submitted
by Codera,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
she alleged that she was arbitrarily dismissed from work "on grounds of serious
misconduct; gross negligence and falsification of documents/records ** without
the benefit of an impartial investigation as well as ** the right to confront
the witnesses against her." She argued that it took Dyne-Sem at least
eighteen (18) days before it issued the memorandum of October 5, 1988,
separating her from work, and that this "was a length of time within which
it would easily fabricate evidence." She alleged that her own junior
supervisor, Virginia Tividad, "who herself was also investigated,"
had sent a handwritten letter dated October 7, 1988<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
to Dyne-Sem's supervisor (Noel Trivinio) and Production Manager (Alex Domingo)
stating that Codera had "only done work on #861155.01" (requiring
bonding with 1.0 mil wire), and not on #861155.02 (requiring bonding with 1.5
mil wire).</p>

<p class="BODY">In its own position paper, on the other hand<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>

-- Dyne-Sem insisted that Codera's dismissal from employment was for cause,
duly established by satisfactory proof.</p>

<p class="BODY">By agreement of the parties, the case was submitted for decision
on the basis of their position papers and the other evidence on record.  On M<span style="">a</span>rch
2, 1989, the Labor Arbiter<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
rendered his decision, dismissing Codera's complaint for lack of merit, the
decision declaring that based on "the contention and denials, and the
sequences of events spelled-out and elucidated in the arguments in the position
paper of respondents, there can be no other conclusion than that complainant is
guilty of gross negligence and misconduct which is a just cause for dismissal
of employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter's judgment was, however, reversed by the
National Labor Relations Commission on appeal taken by Codera.  In justification of said reversal, the
Commission adverted, in its decision promulgated on May 10, 1991<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
to (a) what it described as the "partial and one-sided investigation
posited (sic) by ** (Dyne-Sem, which violated) Codera's constitutional right to
due process (presentation of her evidence and the opportunity to cross-examine
her accusers/s and witnesses against her in an impartial investigation),"
and "a clear disregard of material evidence ** (of) Codera's innocence or
non-culpability of the charges levelled against her."</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC faults the investigation conducted by Dyne-Sem on
October 3, 1988 because "no witnesses (were) presented which complainants
could have cross-examined as this could be gleaned from the Minutes of said
investigation, attached as 'Annex G' to respondent's (Dyne-Sem's) position
paper."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The document referred to was obviously merely a very terse,
general statement of what had taken place in the investigation, and not meant
to be a verbatim or even a detailed record of everything that had taken place
on that occasion.  What is clearly
apparent therefrom, and this is not disputed by Codera,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
is that an investigation was scheduled and held on October 3, 1988; that Codera
was timely notified thereof and in fact attended the meeting together with the
Executive Vice-President of her labor union (A. Palillo); that at that meeting
Plastic Frontline Manager Alex Domingo "presented the details of the
missing/mutilated Supertex 20L units with Wafer Lot#86155.02;" that Codera
denied "seeing/processing the said units even upon presentation of QA
records" and, despite importunities by Dyne-Sem officers, "continued
to deny seeing/processing/cons re- the said units;" that A. Pafillo had
spoken out in Codera's behalf, expressing the opinion "that the
loss/mutilation of the units could not have been committed by Ms. Codera alone
and that others were involved;" and that finally, prior to the meeting, or
on September 30, 1988, Codera had submitted a letter to Personnel Department
Head Galvez containing her "responses to the charges given me by my
superior." What is evident, in other words, is that Codera had been
informed of the charges against her, that she had presented a written
refutation thereof, that at an investigation subsequently scheduled, she was
made aware of the details of the charges, and that she and the union officer
representing her were entirely free to speak out in her defense during that
investigation.  Equally plain is that
neither Codera nor the Union officer representing her had asked for any
confrontation with witnesses or offered to produce evidence apart from Codera's
own statements, at that investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is satisfied that Dyne-Sem had complied with the legal
requirements of due process.  It had,
prior to the investigation, furnished her with "written notice stating the
particular acts or omissions constituting the grounds for ** (projected)
dismissal,"<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
it had given Codera an opportunity to "answer the allegations against
(her) ** within a reasonable period" as well as "ample opportunity to
be heard and to defend ** (herself) with the assistance of ** (her)
representative,"<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> and
she was "immediately" notified (i.e., within two (2) days from the
investigation) of the "decision to dismiss ** (her) stating clearly the
reasons thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a> She
was, in fine, given an opportunity to explain her side, with the assistance of
a representative of her choice.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, during the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, after Dyne-Sem had
presented its evidence against Codera in even greater detail, Codera had agreed
to submit the case for decision on the basis of the parties' position
papers.  All these being quite patent on
the record, it was grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC to have
ruled that Codera had been denied due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">So, too, it was grave abuse of discretion on NLRC's part to hold
that Dyne-Sem had disregarded the handwritten letter of Virginia Tividad dated <i>October
7, 1988</i> and even "suppressed (it) during the alleged investigation on <i>October
3, 1988</i>." This is a manifest fallacy.  It was plainly impossible for Dyne-Sem to have taken account, on October
3, 1988, of a letter written four (4) days later! Apart from this, the fact
that the Tividad letter was presented in evidence to and duly passed upon by
the Labor Arbiter, and the author was herself strongly suspected of connivance
with Codera in the effort to keep the misprocessing from the knowledge of the
company, there is no evidence whatever that said letter was ever sent to or
received by Dyne-Sem.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the Labor Arbiter that there is enough
evidence on record to establish sufficient cause for Codera's dismissal from
employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dyne-Sem Manager Alex Domingo deposed among other things that Codera's
statement in her time ticket of September 17, 1988 that she had bonded
(processed) 200 units from 0740H to 0800H -- or 20 minutes -- is a fabrication;
the machine she was using had a capacity of 416 (20L) units per hour or 6.93
units per minute; in 20 minutes it could have bonded only 138.60 units.  Her claim that she had not worked on Lot No.
2 is similarly false, since, according to Domingo, in the whole plant, only
machine No. 30 "was set up to process the two Supertex lots," hence
the units of Lot No. 2 afterwards hidden and discovered days afterwards --
mistakenly bonded with 1.0 mil wire instead of 1.5 mil wire -- could only have
been processed on that machine.  Besides, the bonding sequence in these hidden units of Lot No. 2 was the
same as that followed in the processing of Lot No. 1, admittedly worked on by
Codera.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Merceditas Ferrer, "Quality Assurance Inspector assigned at
the Plastic Frontline, Lead Bond, wire pull monitoring at Dyne-Sem **, "
stated under oath that in the course of performing her duty "to monitor
the progress of the processing of lots, frames and dice being worked on by an
operator," particularly Noema Codera who on September 17, 1988 had been
assigned to work on the 1419 Machine No. 30, she had seen the latter working on
Lot #86115.01 at 7:22 a.m., and on Lot #861155.02 at 9:43 a.m.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Bella Rodique, "Junior Supervisor for Lead Bond, Plastic Frontline at
Dyne-Sem ** ," deposed that on September 17, 1988 she had placed two (2)
lots of Supertex frames on machine No. 30, assigned to Norma Codera, these
being Lot 861155.01, requiring bonding with 1.0 mil gold wire, and Lot
861155.02, requiring bonding with 1.5 mil gold wire.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
Teresita S. Tiglao, "Quality Assurance Inspector of Molding, Plastic
Backend at Dyne-Sem ** ," declared under oath that on September 28, 1988,
while arranging some dummy frames contained in a tray carrier (dummy frames
being "rejects" or unusable units), she had seen five (5) frames of
Supertex units which she separated from the others; that her microscopic examination
of these five frames the following day confirmed her suspicion that the units
were good units marked with ink to make them appear as rejects or unusable
units.  Rosalinie M. de Padua,
"Production Supervisor," deposed among others that the record
regarding wire pulling had been altered by someone by crossing out
"0.2" and placing "0.1" atop it.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the testimony of the persons just described, not
otherwise shown to be biased, or harboring any motive to depose falsely against
Codera -- that she had in fact worked on Lot No. 2, and that units of said lot,
showing clear indications of misprocessing had been falsely marked as
"rejects" -- there are other circumstances demonstrative of the
misprocessing ascribed to her and the efforts by her and others to prevent
discovery thereof, namely:  the
"tracking record on whyteboard" -- in which Lot #86115.02 (Lot No. 2)
still appeared under the column <i>"for bonding;" </i>"the wire
pull monitor record" indicating that "there was nothing which showed
(that) the 1.5 wire<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a> was
used;" and the fact that the units of Lot No. 2 hidden and later
discovered in different places showed that they had been "bonded with 1.0
mil. wire, * * (and the ) bond sequence was similar to that of (Lot No.
1)."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor has the Court been cited to any rational motive on Dyne-Sem's
part to single out Codera for dismissal.  No reason exists for an employer to dismiss an otherwise competent and
experienced employee unless the latter were, as here, guilty of gross
negligence and misconduct.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly</b>, the writ of <i>certiorari </i>prayed for is

Relations Commission (First Division) in NLRC NCR Case No 00-10-­04355-88
