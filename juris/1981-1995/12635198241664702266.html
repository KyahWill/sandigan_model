				<H3>SPOUSES RICARDO AND LOURDES CORTEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. JUDGE SERAFIN E. CAMILON, PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT OF
FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, PASIG BRANCH
VIII AND RECAREDO CORONEL, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal on a question of law under Republic Act No.
5440 from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Pasig Branch
VIII, ejecting the Cortez spouses from the apartment known as 4541-D Quintos
Street, Makati, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of First Instance affirmed the judgment of the Makati municipal court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ground for ejectment is the lessor's need of the apartment
for the use of his daughter, Grace Coronel-Valdez, who is residing with her
in-laws also on Quintos Street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">We </span>gave due
course to the petition because of the tenants' contention that that ground for
ejectment applies only to cases where the lease has expired and it cannot apply
to the case of the Cortez spouses where the month-to-month lease did not expire
and where ejectment based on that ground has been suspended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plausibility of that contention is more apparent than
real.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1673.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lessor
may judicially eject the lessee for any of the following causes:</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">(1) When the period agreed upon, or that which is fixed for the
duration of leases under articles 1682 and 1687, has expired;</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) Lack of payment of the price stipulated;</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) Violation of any of the conditions agreed upon in the
contract;</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) When the lessee devotes the thing leased to any use or service
not stipulated which causes the de­terioration thereof; or if he does not
observe the re­quirement in No. 2 of article 1657, as regards the use
thereof."</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1687.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
period for the lease has not been fixed, it is understood to be from year to
year, if the rent agreed upon is annual; from month to month, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">if </span>it is monthly; from week to week,
if the rent is weekly; and from day to day, if the rent is to be paid
daily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, even though a monthly
rent is paid, and no period for the lease has been set, the courts may fix a
longer term for the lease after the lessee has occupied the premises for over
one year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the rent is weekly, the
courts may likewise determine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">a </span>longer
period after the lessee has been in possession for over six months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case of daily rent, the courts may also
fix <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">a </span>longer period after the
lessee has stayed in the place for over one month."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 20 (which amended Republic Act 6359 passed
in 1971), as an act of social justice, froze the rentals of the lower income
group of persons at their 1972 levels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except when
the lease is for a definite period, the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article
1673 of the Civil Code of the Philippines insofar as they refer to dwelling
unit or land on which another's dwel­ling is located shall be suspended until
otherwise pro­vided; but other provisions of the Civil Code and the Rules of
Court of the Philippines on lease contracts, insofar as they are not in
conflict with the provisions of this Act, shall apply".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Batas Pambansa Blg. 25 in 1979 specified the grounds for
ejectment for tenants of residential units the total monthly rental of which
does not exceed three hundred pesos <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">(P300).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It</span> provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Grounds for Judicial Ejectment</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">. - </span>Ejectment shall be allowed on the

<p class="BODY">The Cortez spouses contend that, under the foregoing legal
provisions, the landlord's need of the apartment for the use of an immediate
member of his family <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is a </span>ground
for ejectment only when the lease contract is for a fixed period and it has ex­pired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not apply to their month-to-month
lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 12, Brief).</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is fallacious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Recaredo Coronel, the landlord, terminated the month-to-month lease of
the Cortez spouses in his demand to vacate dated June 4, 1979 (Exh. A).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ejectment suit was filed in September,
1979.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ground was not the expiration of the month-to-month
lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That cannot be a ground under
Presidential Decree No. 20 and Batas Pambansa Blg. 25.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">ground
was the landlord's need of the apartment for his daughter's use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a legitimate ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
