title to Lot 2381 of the <span class="SpellE">Opon</span> Cadastre, which, as
shown by a certified copy of the Municipal Index of Decrees (Annex A of the
petition), was supposedly adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>,

could not be located despite diligent search; that there were no annotations or
liens and encumbrances on the title affecting the same; that no deed or
instrument affecting the property had been presented for registration; and
that, based on the plans and technical description marked as Annexes B and C,
the area, location, and boundaries of Lot 2381 are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination of the sparse records before us, we

substantial variance between the petition for reconstitution and the court's

Juana, <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span>, <u>Pedro</u> and <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span>,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>, <span style="">as </span>evidenced by the entry in the Municipal Index of Decrees, the

Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>" (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The error adverted to in the motion for reconsideration is
substantial for it affects the participation and interest of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span> (or his heirs) in Lot No. 2381, an interest that
appeared in the petition for reconstitution and in the notice of hearing issued
by the court, but which disappeared from the court's order of reconstitution dated
June 7, 1979, having been replaced by "Petra <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>"
instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court issued a
three-page-single-spaced order, disposing of the motion for

court's order denying their motion for reconsideration (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They filed a
notice of <span class="GramE">appeal,</span> cash appeal bond and a motion for
extension of time to file a record on appeal on <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1980</st1:date> or 24 days later, with two (2) or more
days of the appeal period to spare.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their record on appeal was actually filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1980</st1:date>, within the 10-day extension which
they sought from the court (p. 29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, their appeal was seasonably filed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But apart from the
question of whether their appeal was timely or not, the more important issue is
the validity of the order of reconstitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the petition for reconstitution of title was a proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>, compliance with the requirements of R.A. 26 is
a </span>condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u> for the conferment of
jurisdiction on the court taking cognizance of the <span style="">petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that both
the petition and the </span>court's notice of hearing, referred to the
reconstitution of the title of Lot 2381 in the names of the registered
co-owners, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>
married to Maria <span class="SpellE">Igot</span>, Juana, <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span>,
Pedro and <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>,
the cadastral court had jurisdiction only to grant or deny the prayer of the
petition as published in the notice of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court could not receive evidence proving that Petra <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>, instead of Pedro, is a registered co-owner of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2381.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reconstitution or
reconstruction of a certificate of title literally and within the meaning of
Republic Act No. 26 denotes restoration of the instrument which is supposed to
have been lost or destroyed in its original form and condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the reconstitution of any
document, book or record is to have the same reproduced, after observing the
procedure prescribed by law, in the same form they were when the loss or
destruction occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in <span class="SpellE">Bunagan</span>, et al. vs. CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
et al., 97 SCRA 72, where the certificate of title was decreed in the names of
"Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ompad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Icong</span>," the reconstitution of the title <span style="">in </span>the names of "spouses Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ompad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> <span class="SpellE">Icong</span>" was held to be "a material change that
cannot be authorized."</p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisdiction of the cadastral court is hedged in by the four
walls of the petition and the published notice of hearing which define the
subject matter of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
court oversteps those borders, it acts without or in excess of its jurisdiction
in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the allegations of the petition and the published
notice of hearing, the heirs of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span> had no
reason to oppose the petition for reconstitution for the rights and interest in
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2381 of their ancestor, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>,
were not adversely affected by the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when Pedro's name (and in effect, his interest in Lot 2381)
disappeared from the court's order of reconstitution that his heirs had cause
to rise in arms as it were, and ask for the reopening of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no gainsaying the need for courts to proceed with
extreme caution in proceedings for reconstitution of titles to land under R.A.
26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experience has shown that this
proceeding has many times been misused as a means of divesting a property owner
of the title to his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through
fraudulent reconstitution proceedings, he wakes up one day to discover that his
certificate of title has been cancelled and replaced by a reconstituted title
in someone else's name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts,
therefore, should not only require strict compliance with the requirements of
R.A. 26 but, in addition, should ascertain the identity of every person who
files a petition for reconstitution of title to land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the petition is filed by someone other
than the registered owner, the court should spare no effort to assure itself of
the authenticity and <span style="">due execution </span>of
the petitioner's authority to institute the proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should avoid being unwittingly used as a tool of swindlers and
impostors in robbing someone of his title.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not appear that the above precautions had been taken in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note that:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The registered owners
(or their heirs) had not been individually notified of the filing of Otto's
petition for reconstitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) His authority, if any, and that of Atty. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>, to represent <u>all</u> the registered co-owners
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2381 in the reconstitution proceeding, does not
appear to have been investigated by the court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) It does not appear that the court verified Atty. <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ellescas</span>' authority to
appear as counsel for the <span class="SpellE">movants-intervenors</span>, Pedro,
Juana and <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinote</span> (who
are also supposed to be represented by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>),
and their heirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) Neither did it ascertain the identities of the heirs of Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> and Juana who filed the motion to reopen the
reconstitution proceedings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5) We are intrigued why the heirs of Juana and <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pinote</span>, through Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ellescas</span>,
asked for reconsideration of the court's order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1979</st1:date> since their interests in <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2381 were not adversely affected by the court's order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1979</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6) It does not appear that the court carefully ascertained the
genuineness of the abstract of the decision of the cadastral court (which the
petitioners alleged to be uncertified).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7) Ascertaining which is correct or wrong:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the abstract of the decree, or, the Municipal
Index of Decrees - calls for the reopening of the <span class="SpellE">reconsitution</span>
proceeding and the careful examination of all available evidence as to who are
the true registered co-owners of Lot 2381, for the Court may have unknowingly
changed the ownership of Lot 2381 by vesting title in a stranger or impostor.</blockquote>
