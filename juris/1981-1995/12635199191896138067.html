against the petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Naty</span> Castillo and <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> Castillo, in Civil Case No. 209267, plaintiff
alleging that he is the true and lawful owner of a two-story house situated at
921-A R. Papa Extension, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila; that
herein parties entered into an oral contract of lease whereby plaintiff leased
unto defendants the ground floor and mezzanine of his aforementioned house for
a monthly rental of P70.00; that on or about December 29, 1971, plaintiff
personally and orally notified defendants that he is terminating the said
contract of lease for the reason that he is going to make some repairs in said
premises where he and his family will transfer and reside; that upon request of
herein defendants, plaintiff allowed them and their family to stay and reside
in the subject premises until January 31, 1972 so as to afford them time to
look for another residence where they can transfer; that despite the lapse of
the grace period and demands made upon them to vacate the subject premises,
they failed and refused to vacate the <span class="GramE">premises</span> to
plaintiff's prejudice and damages at the rate of P70.00 a month, representing
the fair rental value of the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He further prayed for moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's
fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On February 15, 1972,
defendants <span class="SpellE">Castillos</span> filed their Answer with
Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaim wherein defendants alleged that they have
no knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the material
averments in par. 2 of the complaint and specifically deny the same, the truth
of the matter is that plaintiff is not the owner of the two-story house </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">well as the lot where said house now stands,
as the aforesaid house was built and constructed by defendants out of the loose
materials and debris of the last World War II and made it fit for human
habitation, till the present; the land is a public land under the Bureau of
Buildings and Real Property Management of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further alleged no knowledge sufficient
to form a belief as to the truth of the material averments in par. 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9 and 10 of the complaint and, therefore, specifically denied the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter are stated
in the affirmative defenses that plaintiff has misrepresented to the Bureau of
Buildings and Real Property Management that he is the present occupant; that he
bought his right from another person; and that he is qualified to acquire the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further claim that they have
a preferential right to acquire the land and that the award to the plaintiff is
under protest and investigation, hence the complaint is pre­mature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As counterclaim, defendants sought damages
and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">After trial, the City
Court made the following findings of facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence adduced, it was shown that plaintiff is the
owner of a two-storey house situated at 921-A R. Papa Extension, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said house was erected on a lot
identified as Lot No. 1-b-3 of the C. <span class="SpellE">Lerma</span> and R.
Papa Subdivision, subdivision plan Psd-98921.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Adjacent to the house of the plaintiff is another two-storey house
belong­ing to Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> and identified as No.
921 R. Papa Extension, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This house belonging to Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> is situated on Lot No. 1-B-5 and at the same time
encroaches on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>portion of Lot
No. 1-B-3 which is occupied by the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the Philippine Government awarded <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1-B-3 to the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> sold that portion of his house which <span class="GramE">encroached</span> <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1-B-3 to the plaintiff
as evidenced by Exhibit "A".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, that portion of Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa's</span>
house which was sold to the plaintiff became part and parcel of that house
owned by the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants came
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">occupy the ground floor, the
mezzanine as well as the portion bought from Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
by the plaintiff at a monthly rental of P70.00.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1971" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1971</st1:date>,
plaintiff verbally notified the defendants that he wanted the premises leased
to them vacated, because he wanted to make repairs, thereon preparatory to his
moving in together with his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants pleaded to the plaintiff to allow them to stay until the end
of January, 1972 to enable them to look for another place to transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such request on the part of the defendants
was granted by the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1972</st1:date>
came, however, de­fendants refused to vacate the aforesaid pre­mises as well as
pay rentals thereon from January, 1972 up to the present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this case is filed before this Court
thru counsel on whom plaintiff obligated himself to pay the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon the other hand, defendants claim that sometime in 1946,
Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> built a house on the one-half
portion of his lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other half was
left vacant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1957, they
sought permission from <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> to build a house on
the vacant lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
consented to defendants' request to build on the vacant portion of his lot at a
monthly rental of P20.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later on, this
house constructed by the defendants was demolished as Mr. <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
made an extension which overlapped the house built by the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendants contend that what they leased
from Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> was the use of the one-half
vacant lot belonging to <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> while the house which
they constructed thereon was theirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court cannot agree with the posture taken by the
defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, Exhibit
"A" clearly shows that what Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
conveyed in favor of the plaintiff was that portion of the house 'encroaching
on Lot No. 1-B-3 of subdivision plan Psd-98921, free from all liens and
encumbrances,' (Vide:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1st par., page 2
of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If so, and as claimed by the defendants that
they were the owners of the house, why did they not charge <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
criminally in court?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why did they not
hold <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> on his warranty against eviction?</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the second place, Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa's</span>
testimony the first time he testified before this Court is very clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'ATTY. MANALO:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Q
- And what portion of your house was being occupied by the defendants?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">A
- The ground floor and the mezzanine and also the extension of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Q
- And what is the relation of this house of yours, the ground floor, the mezzanine
and the extension which are being occupied by the defendants, to that portion
of your house which you sold to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">xxx</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">COURT:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">They are occupying the portion of the house sold to the plaintiff?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A - Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">Is that clear?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A
- Yes, very clear, <span class="GramE">Your</span> Honor.'</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>,
pp. 3-4; 12-13, Hearing of </span><st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">July 11, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>So it is clear that the defendants were oc­cupying that portion of
the house belonging to <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> which the latter sold
to the plaintiff per Exhibit "A".</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the third place - and this is quite important - the defendants
waived the cross examination of the plaintiff!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it because the plaintiff
was telling the truth and that cross-examination of the witness would prove damaging
to the cause of the defendants?</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the fourth place, the turn-about made by the witness, Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>, on <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="7">July
 13, 1972</st1:date> weakens rather than strengthens the case for the
defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, note the
surprising turn-about of the witness the second time he was placed on the
witness stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked, he answered
thus -</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q - Mr. and Mrs.
Castillo, the defendants were occupying the ground floor of your 2-storey
house?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - And they are occupying the ground
floor as your lessee?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - Yes, of course.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>This later version of the witness could not be believed by this
Court, as very probably that the witness had conferred with the de­fendants <span class="GramE">which</span> actuated him to make a turnabout.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, his testimony on <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1972</st1:date> was more in conformity
and in consonance with Exhibit "A".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino vs. <span class="SpellE">Olviga</span>,
60 Phil. 17).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Again, the defendants interposed the defense that the house claimed
by the plaintiff is theirs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> there is the
judicial</span> admission of defendants that the lot whereon the house leased
by them from the plaintiff has been awarded by the government to the herein
plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Answer,
par. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2 of </span>Affirmative
Defenses).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the cogent
and simple explanation of the plaintiff as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to the owner</span>ship<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> of</span> the
house belongs to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">plaintiff."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Based on the above findings of facts, the City Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">rendered judgment

23.0pt">Ma</span>nalo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> sold his house
to plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records of this case
show that the lot on which the house is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">located
belongs to the government and that <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> was a
lessee or an <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> from the government of said lot,
the other portion remaining vacant.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On August 1957 the evidence shows that the defendant-spouses <span class="SpellE">Castillos</span> asked per­mission from <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
to build a barong-­barong on the vacant portion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was granted and the barong-barong was
constructed with the help of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>carpenter Pedro <span class="SpellE">Peredo</span>, and for the
occupancy defendants were paying Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> a
monthly rental of P20.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During the trial of this case before the lower Court, Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> was pre­sented as a witness for the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted having sold the house to the
plain­tiff in accordance with the deed of sale exe­cuted on <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1971</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> also was a witness for the de­fendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony he clarified his declaration
as plaintiff's witness to the effect that what he sold to the plaintiff was
only the extension of his house that covered the roof of the barong-barong of
the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He described how, during
the negotiations with Francisco <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, father of the
plaintiff, he definitely indi­cated to the buyer the portion or the subject
matter of the deed of sale which <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> was selling
to <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this connection, it should be mentioned that <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
extended his house over the roof­ing of the barong-barong constructed by the
defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When this happened, the
defendants demolished their barong-barong and constructed their own, the
present <span class="SpellE">groundfloor</span> and the mezzanine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same carpenter who testified constructing
the barong-barong also testified that he constructed the mezzanine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The plaintiff now claims that what he bought was part of the upper
storey and the ground floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defendants claim that the <span class="SpellE">groundfloor</span> and the
mezzanine belong to them and were not included in the transaction bet­ween <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court, after reviewing the records of this case including the
transcript of steno­graphic notes and the memoranda submitted by the parties,
is convinced that what was sold by <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> was only
the upper second storey over hanging the barong-barong constructed by the <span class="SpellE">Castillos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> made this very clear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">during his testimony as defendants' witness and even during the
cross-examination when the first testified as plaintiff's witness that what he
sold was just the portion of the extension of his house overwhelming the roof
of the barong-barong of the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He made it clear to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, father
of the plaintiff, that the <span class="SpellE">groundfloor</span> and the
mezzanine did not belong to him but to the <span class="SpellE">Castillos</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court, on reading the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>,
specifically the portion regarding his explanation as to the matter of the nego­tiation,
sale and indication to the buyer of what he was selling, is convinced that the
truth is that what he sold was only the exten­sion above the house and that the
<span class="SpellE">groundfloor</span> and the mezzanine constructed by the
defendants were not included."</blockquote>

testimony of Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>, vendor of the one-half

thereof under which the defendant <span class="SpellE">Castillos</span> had the
ground floor and the mezzanine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> first testified fo<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">From the deed of sale and
<span class="SpellE">Verzosa's</span> testi­mony, there can hardly be any doubt
that the 'whole portion' of the house standing on Lot 1-B-3 the right to buy
which was awarded to appellant by the Bureau of Buildings and Real Property
Management, was sold by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
means the entire two-storey house of <span class="SpellE">Ver­zosa</span>, the
vendor, including the ground floor and mezzanine of said house which are the
premises claimed by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> as not included in the
sale because they do not belong to the vendor but to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As may be seen from <span class="SpellE">Verzosa's</span>
testimony, the premises in dispute, the ground floor mezzanine floor, has been
occupied by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> for the last 15 years, as
tenants of <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>, paying rentals <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> referred to them as portions of his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<p class="BODY">'And what portions of your house was being occupied by the
defendants?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">'The ground floor and the mezzanine and also
the extension of the house.’</span></p>

<p class="BODY">That the parties to the sale knew the exact extent of the
property sold, and the intent to sell the same, on the part of the vendor, and
to buy it, on the part of the vendee, could also be easily inferred from the
evident purpose of the vendee in buying the house, standing on the lot awarded
to him by the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could not
have wished to buy only the upper portion, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">ex</span>cluding the lower portions, as what <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
want the court to believe, through the sub­sequent testimony of <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> which was, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">effect,
a recantation of his earlier testimony given when called as appellant's
witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For in his testimony as
defendant's witness, he disclaims ownership of the disputed premises, pointing
to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> as the owners, in direct contradiction
to what he stated earlier that 'the ground floor and mezzanine' are portions of
his house."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The court further noted that in their Answer, the <span class="SpellE">Cas­tillos</span> did not deny directly and specifically par. 3 of
the complaint wherein it is alleged that the parties entered into an oral
contract of lease of the ground floor and mezzanine of the house for a monthly
rental of P70.00 as they merely averred having "no knowledge sufficient to
form as to the truth thereof".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
should have made a specific denial of the lease contract with respect to the
ground floor and mezzanine because they own said premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance tends strongly to negate
the <span class="SpellE">Castillos</span>' claim of ownership of the disputed
premises, especially con­sidering that when asked to vacate the premises, they
asked for a grace period of more than a month, that is, up to January 31, 1972
for them to look for another residence, which the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court further
relied on the rule that where the witness makes two conflicting testimonies,
the trial court's appraisal <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>to
which <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>more credible is as a
rule strongly persuasive upon the appellate court for having had the
opportunity to personally observe the witness' demeanor and deportment while testifying,
which appellate courts do not have.</p>

<u>FACTS AND ISSUE</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The
factual background of this case may be explained as follow:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a subdivision in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
owned by the Government, and which is to be sold to private citizens, there are
two contiguous lots, 1-B-3 (<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3) and 1-B-5 (<st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About 1957, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
5 had already been awarded to Federico <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>, and
he had built a house of two stories thereon, one side of which was on the
border line between <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5 and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3 was then
vacant, and had not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">yet been awarded to
anybody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants approached </span><span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> and, with his permission, built a barong-barong on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
3 adjoining the side of <span class="SpellE">Verzosa's</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The barong-barong did not rise beyond the
first storey of <span class="SpellE">Verzosa's</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later on, <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
extended the second floor of his house into <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3 over
the barong-barong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still later on,
defendants improved the barong-barong by cementing the ground floor and

sold to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>?"
gave this answer:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"This is within
the portion of the house I sold . . . inside of the por­tion of the house I
sold to <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>."
From this testimony, the respondent Court of Appeals ruled that "the
'whole portion' of the house standing on Lot 1-B-3 was sold by appellant."</p>

<p class="BODY">Again this is a grave error of misapprehension of the evidence
because <span class="SpellE">Verzosa's</span> answer is vague, for it may refer
to the physical fact that indeed the disputed premises are inside or within the
portion of the house sold, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is, </span>of
course, true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> had declared in his tes­timony that before the execution
of the deed of sale and in the inspection of the premises, he explained to <span class="SpellE">Manalo's</span> representative that the ground floor and mezzanine
were not his and that they were excluded from the sale since they belong to the
<span class="SpellE">Castillos</span>, petitioners herein, and which dec­laration
is not disputed or denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
respondent court simply rejected the clarification made by <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
without attempting to reconcile his two testimonies which are not entirely
inconsistent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is the duty of
the court to reconcile discrepancies or differences in the statements of a
witness, or where one statement is plainly a correction of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contradictory statements should be considered
in the light of explanations and attending <span class="GramE">circumstances,</span>
and it should be considered whether incon­sistencies or incongruities result
from misconception of an innocent witness or <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
and corrupt misrepresentation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(The
Revised Rules of Court, Evidence, Vol. VII, p. 613, by Vicente J. Francisco).</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule that petitioners are the owners of the disputed premises
and being builders in good <span class="GramE">faith,</span> are entitled to
payment of the indemnity under Article 448 and the right of retention under
Article 546 of the New Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Having resolved the
question of ownership in favor of petitioners, <span class="GramE">We</span> find
it pointless and without any useful purpose to discuss and resolve the other
assignments of errors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the decision
appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">This ejectment case involving the <u>ground floor and mezzanine </u>of
a small two-storey house in the G. Lerma and R. Papa Subdivision, Sampaloc,
Manila has <u>unjustifiably and needlessly</u> occupied the time, energy and attention
of the city court of Manila, its Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeals
and this Court for more than <u>ten years</u> due to the failure of the lawyers
to get the facts from their clients and to present those facts to the courts,
the failure of the city court to ascertain the truth as to ownership of the
said premises and the ambivalent testimonies of Federico Verzosa, a law
graduate and customs employee, who testified on July 11, 1972 for the plaintiff
and, two days later, testified for the defendants, thus making confusion worse
than confounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An ocular inspection
and photo­graphs could have been useful.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1946, Federico Verzosa built a two-storey house on the
one-half portion of <u>Lot 1-B-5</u> (Lot 5) of the G. Lerma and R. Papa
Subdivision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lot had an area of <u>35
square meters</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In August, 1957,
Verzosa allowed the spouses Naty Castillo and Isabelo Castillo to construct a <u>barong-barong­</u>
on the other vacant one-half portion of Lot 1-B-5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>barong-barong</u> <u>encroached</u> on
the <u>adjoining lot</u>, Lot 1-B-3 (Lot 3) also with an area of 35 square
meters, which was later awarded to Lamberto L. Manalo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verzosa extended his two-storey building to cover the <u>barong-barong</u>
of the Castillos who then renovated the <u>barong-barong</u> into a ground
floor and mezzanine of Verzosa's two-storey house (28 tsn July 13, 1972, City
Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pedro Perido, the carpenter,
corroborated Verzosa's testimony on this point.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 13, 1971, Verzosa sold to Lamberto L. Manalo for
P3,878.20 (after making negotiations with Francisco Manalo, Lamberto's father,
another contributory cause of the confusion) "<u>the whole portion of
his" two-storey house which was built on Lot No. 1-B-5 but
"encroaching on Lot No. 1-B-3", which, as already stated, was awarded
to Manalo Exh. A</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Note, however, that in the notarial acknowledg­ment, the notary
stated that the deed of absolute sale refers to a "<u>parcel of land
situated in Sampaloc, Manila</u>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The deed of sale (Exh. A) is erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The notary did not ascertain what was being sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit A is not trustworthy evidence for
Manalo.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Manalo sued the Castillo spouses for eject­ment, the lawyer
of the Castillos did not ascertain the facts from his clients.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not plead the correct facts in his
answer for the Castillos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answer is
not trustworthy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only during the trial in the city court that the facts,
not stated in the answer, were revealed by the Castillo spouses and by Verzosa,
the vendor who did not read carefully the deed of sale and the witness who in
48 hours testified for the opposing parties, Manalo and the Castillo spouses,
and made a spectacle of himself by giving contradictory testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Jose B. Herrera of the city court believed the first
testimony of Verzosa and the deed of sale which, as already stated, was erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he decided in favor of plaintiff
Manalo and ejected the Castillos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Juan L. Bocar of the Court of First Instance believed the
second testimony of Verzosa for the Castillos that he sold only the <u>second
story </u>of his house and that the Castillos <u>owned the ground floor and
mezzanine portion</u> from which they were being ejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court of First Instance decided
for the Castillo spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Bocar correctly found that Verzosa sold to Manalo "the
upper second story overhanging the <u>barong-­baronq</u>" and Verzosa did
not sell the ground floor occu­pied by the Castillos because said ground floor
did not belong to Verzosa, but Judge Bocar failed to state that, as shown in
Exhibit 1 of the Castillos, the ground floor and mezzanine (the original <u>barong-barong</u>)
were constructed on <u>Lot 1-B-3</u> (Lot 3) which was awarded to Manalo as
indi­cated in the deed of sale, Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals, in a decision dated January 31,
1978, reversed Judge Bocar's decision and affirmed that of City Judge
Herrera.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That decision was reiterated in
the denial of the Castillos' first and second motions for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Juliano-Agrava in her dissent found that the Castillos
constructed their <u>barong-barong</u> and later their ground floor and mezzanine
on Lot 1-B-3 (Lot 3) awarded to Manalo (p. 134, Rollo).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals should
be reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since this is an ejectment case wherein the city court decided
the ownership of the ground floor and mezzanine, the appeal from the decision
should have been made di­rectly to the Court of Appeals (Secs. 3[c] and 5,
Republic Act 5967, enlarging the jurisdiction of city courts).</p>

<p class="BODY">What is the correct and just solution of the case?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Castillos cannot be ejected from the
ground floor and mezzanine because they own those portions of the house but
certainly they are builders in bad faith and should lose what they had built
(Art. 449, Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cannot
remove the ground floor and mezzanine because that would destroy Manalo's
second floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even as <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
lessees, they are not entitled to reimbursement for the value of the ground
floor and mezzanine (Art. 1678, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since they had been staying in Manalo's Lot 1-B-3 (Lot 3) for
more than ten years or during the pendency of this case, the rentals or the
accumulated reasonable value of the use and occupation thereof should be waived
by Manalo but the Castillos must vacate the ground floor and mezzanine which
can now be regarded as Manalo's property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The result is the same if they had been ejected therefrom but
they need not pay the rentals or the rea­sonable value of the use and
occupation thereof.</p>
