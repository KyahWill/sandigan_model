confirmed by the respondent Commission before they could take their oaths
and/or assume office as members of the House of Representatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This opposition compelled Speaker Ramon V. <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>, Jr. to suspend the <span class="SpellE">oathtaking</span>

respective sectors the seats reserved for <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span>

Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue is, whether the Constitution requires the appointment
of <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives to the House of
Representatives to be confirmed by the Commission on Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 16, Article VII of the Constitution enumerates, among
others, the officers who may be appointed by the President with the consent of
the Commission on Appoint­ments, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 16.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The President

otherwise provided for by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law to

the appointment of other officers lower in rank in the President alone, in the

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><b>Sarmiento</b></span><b> vs. <span class="SpellE">Mison</span>, et al.</b> (156 SCRA 549 [1987]), we construed
Section 16, Article VII of the Constitution to mean that only appointments to
offices mentioned in the first sentence of the said Section 16, Article VII
require confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is readily apparent that under the provisions of the 1987
Constitution, just quoted, there are four (4) groups of officers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">whom the President shall appoint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These four (4) groups, to which we will
hereafter refer from time to time, are:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

other public ministers and consuls, officers of the armed forces from the rank
of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested

appointments are not otherwise provided for by law;</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Third</b>, those whom the President may be authorized by law to

<blockquote><b>Fourth</b>, officers lower in rank whose appointments the
Congress may by law vest in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">President
alone.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The first group of officers is clearly appointed with the consent
of the Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appointments of such officers are initiated by nomination and, if the
nomination is confirmed by the Commission on Appointments, the President appoints.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(T)he purposive intention and deliberate judgment of the framers of
the 1987 Constitution (is) that, except as to those officers whose appointments
require the consent of the Commission on Appointments by express mandate of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the first sentence in Sec. 16, Art. VII,
appointments of other officers are left to the President without need of
confirmation by the Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This conclusion is inevitable, if we are to presume, as we must, that
the framers of the 1987 Constitution were knowledgeable of what they were doing
and of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">foreseeable effects
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

</span>Such limitations or qualifications must be clearly stated in order to be
recognized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, it is only in the first
sentence of Sec. 16, Art. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">VII </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">where it is clearly stated that appointments

it is indubitable that <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives to
the House of Representatives are among the "other officers whose
appointments are vested in the President in this Constitution," referred
to in the first sentence of Section 16, Art. VII whose appointments are subject

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, there are appointments vested in the President in
the Constitution which, by express mandate of the Constitution, require no

Art. XI).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No such exemption from

<p class="BODY">The invocation of Art. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">XVIII,

hence, the reference to the said paragraph 2 of Section 16, Art. VII in the
appointment extended to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in the invocation of paragraph 2, Section 16, Art. VII
as authority for the appointment of petitioner is, the recognition by the

confirmation by the Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

confirmation by the Commission on Appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that Congress had adjourned without respondent Commission on
Appointments having acted on petitioner's appointment, said
appointment/nomination had become moot and academic pursuant to Section 23 of
the Rules of respondent Commission and "unless resubmitted shall not again
be considered by the Commission."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further contend that nowhere in the Constitution nor
in Executive Order No. 198 is mention made of the need for petitioner's

confines itself to specifying the sectors to be represented, their number, and
the nomination of such <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power of the President to appoint <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span>
representa­tives remains directly derived from Section 7, Article XVIII of the
Constitution which is quoted in the second "Whereas" clause of
Executive Order No. 198.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
appointments by the President of <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span>
representatives require the consent of the Commission on Appointments in
accordance with the first sentence of Section 16, Art. VII of the
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More to the point,
petitioner Deles’ appointment was issued not by virtue of Executive Order No. 198
but pursuant to Art. VII, Section 16, paragraph 2 and Art. XVIII, Section 7 of
the Constitution which require submission to the confirmation process.</p>

</span>Said <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives, after taking
