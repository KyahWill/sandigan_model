				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case had its inception in a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> filed by herein private respondents against
herein petitioner before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, docketed as
Civil Case No. 122136-CV, for non-payment of rentals on an apartment unit owned
by private respondents and rented by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts which led to the filing of said case are
best quoted from the succinct presentation thereof in the challenged decision
of respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that the private respondents are the owners of an
apartment unit which was rented by the petitioner on a month to month basis for
a monthly rental of P466.00 payable in advance; that the petitioner failed to
pay the corresponding rentals for the month of May 1987 up to the filing of the
complaint on August 31, 1987; that on July 9, 1987, private respondents,
through their counsel, sent a demand letter to the petitioner (Exhibit 'R')
requiring him to pay his rentals in arrears and to vacate the leased premises
within five (5) days from receipt thereof, otherwise private respondents will
be constrained to file the appropriate legal action against him; that the
demand letter of private respondents' counsel was received by the petitioner on
July 14, 1987; that in response thereto, the petitioner addressed a letter
dated July 15, 1987 to private respondent Carmen de Jesus, furnishing a copy
thereof to her counsel, stating that the amount of rentals, which the private
respondents allegedly refused to receive, had been deposited at United Coconut Planters
Bank, Taft Avenue Branch, with Account No. 8893 in the name of the petitioner's
son, Mario Manuel, and could be withdrawn upon notice of payment; that in order
to collect the said rentals allegedly deposited with the bank, the private
respondents' counsel sent a letter dated August 14, 1987 to the petitioner,
requesting the payment of the unpaid rentals to his (private respondents'
counsel) office; that the said letter was received by the petitioner on August
18, 1987, and, instead of complying with private respondents' counsel's
request, the petitioner addressed a letter dated August 24, 1987 to the private
respondents' counsel requesting that the rentals in arrears be paid to the
private respondents at petitioner's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The private respondents did not heed the petitioner's request."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On April 6, 1989, after the parties had submitted their
respective affidavits and position papers, the said metropolitan trial court
rendered judgment in favor of private respondents, as plaintiffs therein, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part whereof declares:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiffs, ordering defendant and/or any other person claiming rights under
him to vacate and surrender possession of the premises described as door No.
2444; defendant <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> Manuel to pay the plaintiffs
the amount of P466.00 a month from May 1987 and up to the date defendant and/or
any other person claiming rights under him actually vacates the premises, to
pay the plaintiffs the amount of P500.00 as attorney's fees, plus cost of the
suit."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal in Civil Case No. 89-48914, the Regional Trial Court of
Manila, Branch 35, affirmed the aforesaid judgment <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> in its decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith, petitioner appealed to respondent Court
of Appeals which, in its decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

CA-G.R. SP No. 18961, denied due course to the petition for review and
dismissed the same for lack of merit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was likewise denied by said respondent
court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1990" day="5" month="3">March 5,

<p class="BODY">Before us, petitioner raises two grounds, the first supposedly in
the nature of a <span class="SpellE">supervenience</span>, for the allowance of
his petition, viz.:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A new situation developed and/or came about
which makes <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> unjust and impossible, that is,
the NHA finally awarded the lot over which the subject structure stands to the
petitioner and other tenants and disqualified the private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said ruling or award, the private
respondents are only given the option to either sell the structure to the
petitioner and the other awardees or to dismantle the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, under the circumstances prevail­ing
in this instant case, the private respondents were really in <span class="SpellE"><u>mora</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>accipiendi</u></span>
that even if no deposit or consignation had been made, said <span class="SpellE"><u>mora</u></span>
cannot be cured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner had in fact
continuously made available and deposited his rentals in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the issue of payment or
non-payment of rentals had been made moot and academic by virtue of the NHA
award in favor of the petitioner and the governmental expression of public
policy to protect the actual occupants, specifically the petitioner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition bereft of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The putative award on <st1:date year="1990" day="6" month="4">April
 6, 1990</st1:date> by the National Housing Authority (NHA) to the petitioner
of the lot where the rented apartment stands,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
while this <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case was pending in the Court of
Appeals, is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The juridical
relation between petitioner and private respondents as lessee and <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> is well established and the non-payment of rentals
by petitioner for at least three (3) months is substantiated by the evidence on
record.</p>

<p class="BODY">The award of the lot to petitioner by NHA does not automatically
vest in him ownership over the leased structure thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner cannot invoke the provisions of
the Civil Code on accession there being an existing <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
and lessee relation between him and private respondents.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
A tenant cannot, in an action involving the possession of the leased premises,
controvert the title of his landlord or assert any rights adverse to that title
or set up any inconsistent right to change the relation existing between
himself and his landlord, without first delivering up to the landlord the
premises acquired by virtue of the agreement between themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule <span class="SpellE">estopping</span>
a tenant while he retains possession applies whether the tenant is defendant or
plaintiff and applies even though the landlord had no title at the time the
relationship was created.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Proceedings in forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
are wholly summary in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact
of lease and the expiration of its terms are the only elements of this kind of
action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The question of ownership is unessential and should be raised by the defendant
in an appropriate action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Any controversy over ownership rights could and should be settled after the
party who had the prior, peaceful and actual possession is returned to the
property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case and assuming the new factual milieu posited
by petitioner, he should file a separate action wherein his alleged rights as
owner of the land <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the rights of private
respondents as builders or owners of the structure standing thereon can be
properly ventilated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There can be no
such adjudication here for when the relationship of <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
and lessee is established in an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case, any attempt of the defendant to inject the question of ownership into the
case is inutile except in so far as it might throw light on the right of
possession.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In an appeal from an inferior court in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case the issue of ownership should not be delved into, for an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> action lies even against the owner of the
property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact of possession in itself has a positive value and is endowed with a
distinct standing of its own in the law of property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True, by this principle of respect for the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> status, a wrongful possessor may at times be
upheld by the courts, but this is only temporary and for one sole and special
purpose, namely, the maintenance of public order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The protection is only temporary because it
is intended that as soon as the lawless act of dispossession has been
suppressed, the question of ownership or of possession <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> is to be settled in the proper court and in a
proper action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The larger and permanent
interests of property require that such rare and exceptional instance of
preference in the courts for the actual but wrongful possessor be permitted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner that private respondents are in <span class="SpellE"><u>mora</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>accipiendi</u></span>
cannot be upheld either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure of
the owners to collect or their refusal to accept the rentals are not valid
defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consignation, under such
circumstances, is necessary,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
and by this we mean one that is effected in full compliance with the specific
requirements of the law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5(b) of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, as amended, provides that in case of refusal by
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to accept payment of the rental agreed
upon, the lessee shall either deposit, by way of consignation, the amount in
court or in a bank in the name of and with notice to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure of herein petitioner to comply
with said requirement makes the consignation defective and gives rise to a
cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Compliance with the requisites of a valid consignation is mandatory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be complied with fully and strictly
in accordance with the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Substantial
compliance is not enough.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the earlier discussion, petitioner evidently did not comply
with the requirements for consignation prescribed by the governing law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, as expounded by the Court of
Appeals -</p>

<blockquote>"The failure of the petitioner to fully and strictly comply
with the requirements of consignation as aforementioned, renders nil his
contention that the private respondents have no cause of action against
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As there was no valid consignation,
payment of the more than three months rental arrearages was not effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 5(b) of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, as amended, arrears in payment of rent for three
(3) months at any one time, is a ground for judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For such non-payment of the petitioner to the
private respondents of the monthly rentals from May, 1987 until the case was
filed on August 31, 1987, or for more than three (3) months, there therefore
existed a cause of action in favor of the private respondent <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> against the petitioner lessee."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
