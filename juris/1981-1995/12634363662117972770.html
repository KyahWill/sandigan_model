Jose De Vera.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On 19 August 1985,
private respondent Allied Banking Corporation filed an amended petition,
charging the members of the Allied Bank Employees Union ("Union")
with having staged an illegal strike and other concerted actions.  The Union countered by alleging unfair labor
practices, illegal dismissal, and violation of B.P. 130 on the part of the
private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After hearing, the Labor
Arbiter issued a decision, dated 4 September 1992, stating that the strike
conducted on 3 and 4 January 1985, barely sixteen (16) days after the Minister
of Labor and Employment had assumed jurisdiction over the labor dispute, as
well as the strike staged on 11 February 1985 that lasted up to 11 March 1985,
was illegal being in violation of Article 263, paragraph </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(g) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of the Labor Code.  Only the
union officers, however, who knowingly participated in the illegal strike were
held liable in the absence of proof that the individual members participated in
any illegal act during the strike.  The
Labor Arbiter held that there were no just and valid causes for the termination
of the services of the union’s individual members (inclusive of the
petitioners).  Finding that while
private respondent bank, on 7 October 1986, had reinstated the individual union
members after this Court promulgated its </span>Resolution, dated 29 September
1986, in G.R. No. 75749, entitled "Allied Banking Corporation vs. Hon.
Augusto Sanchez, et al.,” <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">said </span>respondent
bank, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">however, subsequently dismissed
the herein 41 petitioners due to alleged lack of positions in the bank.  The Labor Arbiter concluded </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that the second </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">dismissal of the forty-one petitioners had
been illegal for being without just and lawful cause.  Labor Arbiter De Vera then disposed of the case in this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On 29 September 1992,
petitioners filed a "Motion To </span>Issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On 19 November 1992,
respondent Bank filed with the NLRC a "Petition for Injunction and <i>Mandamus</i>,"
docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 00316-92, praying primarily that the Labor
Arbiter and herein petitioners be restrained from implementing the writ of
execution issued on 30 September 1992.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">petitioners filed their answer </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">3 December 1992.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 February 1993, petitioners' counsel wrote the respondent
Chairman of the NLRC a letter, requesting from him the issuance of a writ of
execution for the immediate reinstatement of his clients to their former
positions.  On 19 May 1993, in a second
letter, counsel reiterated the plea.  On
8 July 1993, the instant petition for <i>mandamus</i> against the public and
private respondents was filed with this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in this petition is whether, on the above
settings, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> lies to compel public respondent to issue
a writ of execution for the reinstatement of the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners take the simplistic view that the "refusal
of the NLRC Chairman to issue a writ of execution to enforce the reinstatement
aspect of the decision of the labor arbiter constitutes an open defiance (to)
the rule of law," and that a "writ of <i>mandamus</i> should be
issued ordering the said Chairman to issue a corresponding writ of execution to
enforce the immediate reinstatement of herein petitioners."</p>

<p class="BODY">The stance is untenable.  Under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, a writ of <i>mandamus</i>
may only issue</p>

<blockquote>"* * *.  When any tribunal, corporation, board, or person unlawfully
neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty
resulting from an office, trust, or station, * * * and there is no other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">plain, </span>speedy and adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law * * *" (Sec. 3)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Given
the circumstances here obtaining, the non-issuance of a writ </span>of
execution by the NLRC Chairman <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cannot
be interpreted to mean an unlawful neglect in the performance of an act which
the law specifically enjoins as a duty.  For a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">writ </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of <i>mandamus</i>
to issue, the petitioner should, on the one hand, have a clear legal right to </span>the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">thing demanded, and there should be,
upon the other </span>hand, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">an
imperative duty of a respondent to perform the act sought to </span>be
mandated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that a writ of execution
has already been issued by Labor Arbiter De Vera and a motion to quash it has
been denied, no longer is the Chairman of the NLRC still called upon, let alone
duty bound, to again issue a similar writ of execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Article 218 [d] of the
Labor Code empowers the National Labor Relations Commission "</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">(</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">t)o
hold any person in contempt directly or indirectly </span>and impose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appropriate penalties therefor in accordance
with law." Considering this statutory provision, we </span>concur with the
view expressed by the Solicitor-General that the petitioners should have
instead "moved to cite private respondent bank for contempt due to its
disobedience, if not belligerent resistance, to the writ of execution lawfully
issued by the Labor Arbiter." A motion to cite the respondent bank for
contempt is not only a plain, speedy and adequate but indeed intended to be the
appropriate remedy that can be sought in order to ensure the proper
implementation of the writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We
</span>take note, furthermore, that pending with the NLRC is a petition for
injunction and <i>mandamus</i> filed by respondent bank to restrain the Labor
Arbiter and the herein petitioners from implementing the writ of
execution.  In the meantime that said petition
is pending with, and still to be acted upon by, the NLRC, a recourse to this
Court would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">yet be </span>premature.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
