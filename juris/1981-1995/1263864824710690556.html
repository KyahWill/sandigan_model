<p class="BODY">The petitions clearly indicate that the petitioners question the

appreciation of the facts is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 7 of Presidential Decree No. 1606 in relation to

said findings of facts are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that 80 cubic meters of <span class="SpellE">yakal</span>
logs were donated by the Consolidated Plywood Industries, Inc. to the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> as evidenced by a deed of
donation dated December 31, 1980 (Exhibit "L"); that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> Palma Gil by virtue of Resolution No. 122-80 of
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span>
of the municipality accepted the donation and that the logs were deposited in
the mayor's premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The logs were intended "for use as bridge materials of the <span class="SpellE">Lugusan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Binogtuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nanaingan</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cuta</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>" as stated in the deed
of donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record shows that the donated logs were not used
in the <span class="SpellE">Cuta</span> <span class="GramE">bridge</span> as
construction on this bridge was already completed in July 1980 before the
donation of logs for the purpose could materialize.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>None of the logs were used in the <span class="SpellE">Lugusan</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Binogtuan</span> bridges
because there was no program of work on the former bridge while the latter
bridge is semi-concrete in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was only in the repair of <span class="SpellE">Nanaingan</span> <span class="GramE">bridge</span> wherein part of the donated logs were used.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the resulting excess lumber was used
in other municipal projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners felt that no irregularities were committed in using the donated
logs on other pressing projects since according to then Governor Rabat of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental who facilitated the <span class="GramE">donation,</span>
the mayor "had a wide discretion in the use of the logs." <span class="GramE">(p. 81, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> - G.R. No. 73642).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the excess lumber, after the completion
of repairs on <span class="SpellE">Nanaingan</span> bridge, was used in the
following municipal projects:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1)
municipal high school building; 2) mini grandstand; 3) shade house; 4) part of
the public market; and 5) 9,000 board feet were used to replace the quantity of
lumber which the mayor had earlier purchased and advanced for the construction
of the <span class="SpellE">Cuta</span> bridge, the high school building, the
shade house, and the public market.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> concedes that <span class="GramE">part of the donated logs were</span> indeed used in the aforesaid
projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it did not give
credence to the mayor's allegation that he had earlier advanced 9,000 board
feet for the construction of the <span class="SpellE">Cuta</span> <span class="GramE">bridge</span> and the other municipal projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

municipal projects like the mini grandstand, high school building, shade house
and partly in the public market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Which means that Mayor Palma Gil must be held guilty of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of 9,000 board feet of <span class="SpellE">yakal</span>

than his say so (sic).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is clear and
convincing is the testimony of prosecution witness Luis <span class="SpellE">Madanlo</span>

in the construction of <span class="SpellE">Cuta</span> Bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The written complaint was dated <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Exhibit FF).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This complaint was followed by a telegram

 1980</st1:date> complaining about the inaction of the same district forester
and his men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Exhibit GG).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, the evidence adduced in Criminal Case No. 9968 is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the <span class="SpellE">Cuta</span>
Bridge was constructed in June or July, 1980 with the use of 9,000 board feet
of <span class="SpellE">yakal</span> lumber which were cut from the public
forests at <span class="SpellE">Sacuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manurigao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caraga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental, and
that 9,000 board feet of <span class="SpellE">yakal</span> lumber were
appropriated by Mayor Palma Gil out of the donation which he received for the
municipality from the Consolidated Plywood Industries, Inc., for which he is
answerable under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the price of <span class="SpellE">yakal</span> lumber in <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> at the
time was P5.90 per board feet, the 9,000 board feet which Mayor Palma Gil
misappropriated is P53<span class="GramE">,100.00</span> for which he must be
condemned under paragraph 4 of the aforesaid provision of the Revised Penal
Code." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>- 73642, pp. 106-108)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We rule that the testimonies of Luis <span class="SpellE">Madanlo</span>
and Juan <span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span> did not prove beyond reasonable
doubt the guilt of the mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
their testimonies even bolster the mayor's defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Madanlo's</span>
testimony to the effect that he was <u>hired</u> and <u>paid</u> by the mayor
to handsaw logs into lumber intended for the <span class="SpellE">Cuta</span> <span class="GramE">bridge</span> gave credence to the mayor's stand that he advanced
his own money to construct <span class="SpellE">Cuta</span> bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This procedure is not at all unusual because
according to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Palma Gil, a former governor and
a former assemblyman of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental, a
"municipal mayor may commence a municipal project without a previously
approved appropriation, even using his own personal funds which he reimbursed
later out of funds appropriated, subject to rules and regulations of
accounting." (p. 93, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. NO. 73642) <span class="GramE">The</span> mayor's testimony that before he made the replacement,
he first consulted Governor Rabat and was told to use the excess in any project
of the town was not rebutted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the mayor, a businessman was considered one of the richest
in the town and could well afford to advance his own money for municipal
projects.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards <span class="SpellE">Ferrando's</span> complaints of
illegal cutting of <span class="SpellE">yakal</span> against the mayor which he
filed with the District Forester of the Bureau of Forest Development, suffice
it to state that, by <span class="SpellE">Ferrando's</span> own admission, no
action was taken against the mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering
the constitutional presumption of innocence accorded to the accused in criminal
cases, we assume that no action was taken in the illegal cutting case because
there was no sufficient basis for such action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This belies the credence given to the alleged source of the logs as
testified by <span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these factors tend to show that the prosecution did not prove
beyond reasonable doubt the charge of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
against the mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mayor
satisfactorily explained that the donated logs were disposed of to construct
municipal projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was
incumbent upon the prosecution to prove otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, it failed to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is absolutely no showing that the
petitioners sold the excess lumber or used it for private purposes or otherwise
profited from the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
he fully accounted for the lumber because the municipal projects where it was
used were actually constructed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out by the petitioners, complainant Juan <span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span> himself credited the accused with having
constructed bridges and making land transportation possible between <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> and the provincial capital of <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental was still part of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> province, <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> was accessible only by ferry service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After 1967, roads and bridges had to be
started.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
summarized the testimony on this point as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As mayor, he has constructed buildings and other
infrastructure projects for the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span>,

<p class="BODY">It is true that all that is needed to find a public officer
guilty of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> is a failure to produce funds
or property for which he is accountable, on demand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, if the funds or property were
validly used for public purposes naturally they can no longer be produced.</p>

and Mayor Palma Gil and Municipal Secretary Nestor <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>
of the crime of falsification of document, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
relied on the supposed several flaws in the claims of the defense which
engendered in the mind of the Court serious doubts as to the truth of the
testimonies of the witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is incorrect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The well-entrenched principle is that the prosecution must rely
on the strength of its evidence and not on the weakness of the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Following this principle, we find, on the
contrary, that there are flaws in the evidence of the prosecution which
engender reasonable doubt in our minds as to the culpability of the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">We next take up the falsification charge against Mayor Palma Gil
and Municipal Secretary Nestor <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, the court relied heavily on complainant <span class="SpellE">Ferrando's</span> testimony to the effect that he was not able to
secure from the provincial secretary a copy of Resolution 47-81, the reversion
resolution and the alleged refusal of the municipal secretary to give him a
copy of the subject Resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts even if true are not convincing proof of the
non-existence of Resolution 47-81 which reverts P78,000.00 of Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) funds to fund new projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although it is a standard operating procedure
that copies of all resolutions of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u> must be forwarded to the Provincial
Secretary, this is not conclusive proof that copies of resolutions not found in
the custody of the Provincial Secretary are non-existent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a matter of procedure taken <u>after</u>
the passage of the resolution by the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The point of query must be whether or not the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sanggunian</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span> really passed such a reversion
Resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span> was then composed of the mayor, the
vice-mayor, <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span>
members, the president of the association of <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captains and the president of the <span class="SpellE">Kabataang</span> <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit B, which is a certified true copy of Resolution No. 47-81
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u>
of <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> approved the recommendation of the
Municipal Development Committee embodied in the committee's Resolution No. 1-81
to divert P78<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> of Community Improvement Program
(CIP) funds to other projects namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>mini?grandstand, shade house and part of the municipal park.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that except for Randy <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span>, the president of the <span class="SpellE">Kabataang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> all members of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u> were present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence also shows that all except
Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span> admit that the revision
Resolution was taken up and passed during the regular session on <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Vice-Mayor who testified for the prosecution stated that he
came to know of the existence of the resolution reverting P78,000.00 during the
month of August, 1981, yet he did not take any action; that in the same month
municipal secretary Nestor <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span> approached him at
his residence and requested him to sign an already prepared resolution which
appeared to have been taken up on July 8, 1981 with him (<span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span>)
as the sponsor and which pertained to the P78,000.00 reversion of municipal
funds; that he did not agree with the proposition so he refused to sign the
resolution; and that Exhibit C, a copy of a resolution appropriating P1,000.00
for the Boa Primary School is the resolution which was actually taken up and
approved on July 8, 1981 and which was numbered Resolution 47-81.</p>

<p class="BODY">Far from making him a star witness for conviction, the statements
made by Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span> cast doubt on his
credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he knew as early as
August 1981, the falsification of the Resolution why then did he not take
action against his political opponent?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why did he wait for a private citizen in the person of <span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span> to investigate the matter?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, his statement that he was
approached by Municipal Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span> as regards
the reversion Resolution must be totally discredited because Resolutions of the
<span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span>
are signed by only two persons:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the secretary
who certifies to its correctness and the presiding officer who attests
thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When this particular resolution
was adopted, the presiding officer was the mayor who was then present during
the session.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Benogsudan</span>, the then municipal
development coordinator of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caraga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
also testified that he was present during the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span> session held on <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1981</st1:date> but no reversion resolution was
passed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This testimony should not be
given credence as against the positive statements of the presiding officer and
the members considering that he was not a member of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span> who was actually
present during the session did not confirm <span class="SpellE">Benogsudan's</span>
presence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the other
member's of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>
were one in saying that <span class="SpellE">Benogsudan</span> was not present
during the session.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was explained by
the mayor that members of the Municipal Development Committee of which <span class="SpellE">Benogsudan</span> is a member may attend the session of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> if they are
required by the mayor or if they ask permission from the mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this particular session, <span class="SpellE">Benogsudan</span> never asked permission to attend the
session.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither was he required to
attend the session.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another factor which negates <span class="SpellE">Benogsudan's</span>
credibility is the fact that he also claimed that the Municipal Development
Committee never met on <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1981</st1:date>
and, therefore, never passed Resolution No. 1-81, which paved the way for the
enactment of the reversion Resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, even the prosecution does not believe him because no
charges for the falsification of this Resolution were filed against the members
of the committee namely, <span class="SpellE">Kagawad</span> Pedro de Guzman,
Municipal Treasurer <span class="SpellE">Pantillo</span>, the Secretary of the
Committee, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Adelito</span> Lozano and Mayor Palma Gil who
is the Chairman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in the
complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span> against the petitioners
with the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, he never questioned the validity
of Resolution 1-81 of the Municipal Development Committee which recommended the
reversion of P78<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> CIP funds to other municipal
projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated:</p>

mentioned in paragraph 3 hereof and re-appropriated the amounts as follows x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Exhibit 2, p. 2)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the prosecution's insistence that Resolution No. 47-81
refers to the appropriation of P1,000.00 municipal aid to the Boa Primary
School, and not the reversion resolution as was indicated in a copy of
Resolution No. 47-81 which <span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span> secured from the
provincial secretary, municipal secretary <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>
explained:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) during the month of July,
1981, copies of the resolutions taken up in the July 8, 1981 session of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span>
were distributed to the different officers like the municipal treasurer, the
provincial auditor and the provincial secretary; 2) the assignment of the
number to resolutions of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span> is done when the minutes of the session are
transcribed by the clerk; 3) he assigned said numbers of the resolutions
previously passed; 4) that when the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain
of Boa asked for a copy of the resolution appropriating P1,000.00 for his
school, he discovered that there were two (2) resolutions bearing the same
number, that is 47-81 which is the reversion resolution and the Boa resolution,
hence in order to distinguish one from the other, he added "A" to the
latter resolution and placed his initial "P" after it, but he did not
alter the contents thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">These two resolutions were adopted in the <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1981</st1:date> session of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Bayan</u></span> as reflected in the minutes of the
session (Exhibit 1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
municipal secretary's explanations as regards the same number (47-81)
designating the two (2) resolutions appear plausible and satisfactory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, this confusion resulting from two
resolutions having the same number became known and was taken advantage of by some
persons to file a complaint for falsification against the mayor and the
municipal secretary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the technical <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
charge, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> said:</p>

<p class="BODY">We reiterate our finding regarding the existence of Resolution
No. 1-81 of the Municipal Development Committee which recommended the reversion
of P78,000.00 of CIP funds earlier set aside for the construction of a guest
house and market layout and initial improvement for other projects namely - a
mini grandstand, multi­purpose shade house and park stage expansion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Governor Rabat testified on the nature of CIP funds as
follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) that what is programmed is
not always implemented as changes may be made depending on circumstances; 2)
that appropriations for one project may be re-appropriated or directed to other
projects upon the passage of the proper resolution by the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span>

<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u> found that the mayor actually advanced his
personal money to begin these other projects which were completed and that the
reverted CIP funds were used to reimburse the mayor for some of his expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, we find no legal basis to convict the
mayor and the municipal treasurer of technical <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>

dwelt on circumstances which convinced the court that the mayor is guilty as
charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that to prove the mayor's violation of the
Anti-Graft Law, the prosecution presented the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> <span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> <span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span>
executed an affidavit, Exhibit R, the contents of which he affirmed except as
to paragraph 10 thereof which he clarified by executing a supplemental
affidavit, Exhibit R-1 before he came to Manila to testify in the instant
cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Exhibit R, he declared that he
is the operator of the CMI Trucking with one (1) cargo truck under 'TH'
denomination; that sometime in June, 1981, Mayor Palma Gil's driver by the name
of Roger approached him with the information that the said mayor is awarding to
him a contract to haul cement and other materials intended for <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span>; that he told Roger he could not accept the contract
because he has only one (1) unit which he is using for previous contracts; that
Roger informed him that the two (2) cargo trucks of Mayor Palma Gil may be used
by him; that he agreed and Mayor Palma Gil's two (2) cargo trucks were used to
haul lumber, G.I. corrugated iron sheets, cement, nails, round bars, M.T.,
Drums, diesel oil and hardware, wherein tracking fees in the amount of P16,577.10
were paid by the government after he issued the waybills for said cargoes; that
the payments were collected by Mayor Palma Gil through Roger who gave the
information that the Mayor needed the money for certain obligations; that there
are many more cargoes for the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span>
which needed hauling, to which he consented provided quarterly taxes in the
amount of P800.00 be paid by the Mayor; and that more cargoes were hauled with
the use of Mayor Palma Gil's cargo trucks wherein the sum of P9,688.00 was paid
by the Ministry of Public Highways in trucking fees which he himself collected
and deposited with the Philippine National Bank, and after deducting his travel
expenses, he issued a check for P9,617.56 payable to Monte Chavez Shell
Marketing who is a creditor of Mayor Palma Gil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Exhibit R-1, <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> <span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span> stated that the transactions concerning the use
of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> Palma Gil's cargo trucks were
negotiated by Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span>, alias 'Roger', who is
Mayor Palma Gil's driver, and not by the mayor himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Cross-examined on the two (2) affidavits which was agreed
upon by the parties as his direct testimony, <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span> declared thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that he never had any direct contract with
Mayor Palma Gil in connection with the use of the latter's cargo trucks; that
he never gave any amount to Mayor Palma Gil but to the gasoline station and the
receipts were handed to Roger; that during the hauling operations, he was the
one referred to as truck operator; that the check in payment of the first
hauling operation was not withdrawn by him; that Mayor Palma Gil's trucks were
used for about three months; and that he presumed that Roger had authority to
use the trucks because previous to the hauling, he had occasion to pass by
Mayor Palma Gil's house and he was informed by the Mayor that the trucks were
entrusted to Roger.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span> is a driver by
occupation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As of April, 1981, he was a
driver of an ISUZU cargo truck bearing Plate No. T-RD-904 which is one (1) of
two (2) cargo trucks of RPG Trucking owned and operated by Mayor <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> Palma Gil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The driver of the other truck which is a HINO was <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gania</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He and <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gania</span> are paid on a
percentage basis:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>25% of the net income
of the truck in case the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is a private
person, and 30% if the hauling is for the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Government hauling contracts are entered into
by Mayor Palma Gil, owner of the trucking business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One such contract was sometime in April 23,
1981, wherein Mayor Palma Gil was authorized by the Property Custodian of the
Office of the Highway District Engineer at <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental to withdraw 1,320 bags of cement from the <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span> Consolidated Industries, Inc. in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City for use in the concreting of San Salvador
Street, <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Oriental (See Exhibit 10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fulfillment of the contract, he made six (6) trips to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
during the month of May, 1981 carrying each time 200 bags of cement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gate passes, like Exhibits Y, Y-1 and Y-2
were issued by the Property Custodian, Mr. Benjamin C. <span class="SpellE">Ongteco</span>,
and at the <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span> Cement Industries, Inc., Delivery
Receipts and Withdrawal Slips like Exhibits Z, Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 are signed by
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The government paid P1<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> for every load of 200 bags which was collected by
Mayor Palma Gil, owner of the cargo trucks, through his checker, <span class="SpellE">Teody</span> <span class="SpellE">Selerio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He ceased to be a driver of Mayor Palma Gil when he received
a note (See Exhibit BB) dated <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="5">May 2,
 1982</st1:date> ordering him to hand over the Isuzu truck to <span class="SpellE">Rolly</span> <span class="SpellE">Tumandao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In obedience to the note, he delivered the
truck to <span class="SpellE">Rolly</span> <span class="SpellE">Tumandao</span> who
signed a receipt for it on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date>
(See Exhibit AA).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And to prove that he
was a driver of Mayor Palma Gil, there is a certification addressed to him as
driver of RPG Trucking, informing him that <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Selerio</span> has been reinstated as checker (See Exhibit
CC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 67-70, G.R. No. 73642)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The mayor was convicted for violating section 3(h) of the
Anti-Graft Law, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 3.</span> Corrupt Practices of Public
Officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already
penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"(h)
Directly or indirectly having financial or pecuniary interest in any business,
contract or transaction in connection with which he intervenes or takes part in
his official capacity, or in which he is prohibited by the Constitution or by
any law from having any interest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This section contemplates <u>actual</u> <u>intervention</u> in
the transaction in which the accused has financial or pecuniary interest in
order that liability may attach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See
Trieste, Sr. v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 145 SCRA 508 [1986])
This does not appear clearly in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract to haul cement and other
materials was given to <span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span> not by the mayor but
by Roger <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in the testimony of Roger <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span> did
he categorically state that the mayor authorized him to award the contract to <span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span>, on the other hand, repeatedly stated that he
never had direct contact with the mayor as regards the contract and that it was
<span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span> who told him that the mayor awarded the
contract to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span>
only assumed the authority of <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span> on the belief
that the mayor entrusted his cargo truck to <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner Palma Gil admitted that he gave one
of his cargo trucks to <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span> for the latter's use
in his charcoal business on condition that <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span>
should maintain the truck and haul, free of charge, the products of his
farm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he used his
trucks to carry on his private business before he became mayor; and that he
sent a checker to check on <span class="SpellE">Bacalla's</span> business
transactions and for fear that his truck may be apprehended by the TRAFCON
because said truck was only for private use, he got back the truck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he denied 1) <span class="SpellE">Bacalla's</span>
claim of having hauled the government cement from <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City to <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> with the use of his trucks and with
him (the mayor) "receiving" a certain percentage from the parcels or
from the payment received by <span class="SpellE">Bacalla</span>; 2) having any
arrangement with any cement factory in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City or
the office of the district engineer in <span class="SpellE">Mati</span> for the
hauling of cement allotted to <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span>; and 3) having
any account with any Shell gasoline station in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the defense testimony and <span class="SpellE">Iturralde's</span>
testimony that he never directly had any transaction with the mayor as regards
the hauling contract plus <span class="SpellE">Bacalla's</span> unexplained
silence on whether or not he was authorized by the mayor to transact business
with <span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span>, there arise reasonable doubts as to
the mayor's culpability for violating section 3(h) of the Anti-Graft Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">One important factor overlooked by the respondent court in
appraising the testimonies of prosecution and defense witnesses is the
political or partisan motivation behind the filing of charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While political differences may prod some
persons to reveal the commission of offenses which may, otherwise, remain
hidden, it is also true that partisan considerations may taint the testimonies
of witnesses who want to put down a political opponent at all costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidence pro and con should, therefore, be
more carefully weighed against each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As pointed out by Mayor Palma Gil, he ran under the banner of the
Mindanao Alliance against the chosen KBL candidate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vice-mayor whom he charges with active
interest in his being convicted and who would become mayor in his stead is a
KBL stalwart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the petitioner
was not in the good graces of the powers that be at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span>, who filed
the charges as a taxpayer interested in the proper disbursement of public funds
was shown to be a delinquent taxpayer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners state that funds for construction projects in
distant municipalities like <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> are slow in
coming.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, local officials have to
be more resourceful and should show more initiative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bridges, mini-grandstand, shade house,
and <span class="GramE">stage park</span> had to be rushed because Governor Rabat
and the whole <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span></u> were going to hold a session with the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangguniang</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u>
of <span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> immediately before the town fiesta on <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the evidence in these cases,
we agree with the petitioners that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
overlooked matters of substance which engender reasonable doubt as to the guilt
of the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant petitions are GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision rendered by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in Criminal Cases Nos. 9968, 9969, 9970 and

reversed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A new judgment is rendered
