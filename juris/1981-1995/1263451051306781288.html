				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>filed pursuant to the provisions of R. 
A. No. 5440, We are asked to set aside the order of the respondent judge
 which dismissed the petitioner's complaint with prejudice.
<p>
The antecedent facts are:
</p><p>
Empress Television, Inc., the petitioner herein, filed on March 13, 
1979, in the Court of First Instance of Rizal a complaint for 
restitution and damages against the Manila Banking Corporation, the 
private respondent herein.  The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 
Q-27172.  In the course of the trial, the following events occurred:
</p><p>
On January 15, 1980, Atty. Ricardo C. Valmonte, counsel for the plaintiff, filed a Motion for Postponement worded as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "THE UNDERSIGNED counsel for the plaintiff respectfully states that: </p>
  <p>
  1.      The undersigned counsel's mother who had been confined for quite a time at the Chinese General Hospital has just died.
  </p>
  <p>
  2.      As a consequence, shock and anxiety engulfed him and it will take time that he be relieved therefrom.
  </p>
  <p>
  3.      The above notwithstanding, it will take time for the 
undersigned to make necessary adjustments, the making of preparations 
entailing his mother's death at the time thereof and even thereafter.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> it is respectfully prayed that the hearing 
scheduled for January 21, 1980 be cancelled and the same be transferred 
to some other dates preferably on any day in March, 1980."
</p><p>
Reacting to the motion, the respondent judge issued an Order on January 16, 1980, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The Motion for Postponement is hereby set for hearing on January 
21, 1980 at 8:30 o'clock in the morning as the defendant did not conform
 to the said motion."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On January 21, 1980, the respondent judge issued another order as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In the absence of the movants, and the counsel for the defendant 
is not also present, the Court grants the petition of plaintiff for the 
postponement of this case, and this case is reset again for pre-trial on
 March 13, 1980, at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should be mentioned that contrary to the statement in the 
above-quoted order, the case was no longer in the pre-trial stage for in
 fact on September 26, 1979, plaintiff petitioner had terminated the 
direct examination of its first witness, as shown in the minutes of the 
hearing on that day.  (Expediente, p. 27.)
</p><p>
The minutes for March 13, 1980 (Expediente, p. 36) show that the 
respondent judge issued an order which was formalized in writing on 
March 18, 1980, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On January 15, 1980 there was filed with this Court a motion for 
postponement from the plaintiff praying that the scheduled hearing for 
January 21, 1980 be cancelled and the same be transferred to another 
date preferably on any day in March, 1980, Because the motion did not 
bear the conformity of the defendant the Court issued an order on 
January 16, 1980 to the effect that the motion be heard on the very date
 the case was set for trial.  On January 21, 1980 the movant was not 
present but as a matter of liberality the Court granted the movant's 
petition for postponement and reset the trial of the case to this date 
March 13, 1980 at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon and from the records of 
the case it appears that the copy of the order sent by registered mail 
to counsel for the plaintiff was returned unclaimed.  Counsel for the 
defendant is now asking for the striking out of the testimony of 
Esperanza T. Vivas and for the dismissal of the case grounded on the 
fact that since counsel for the plaintiff did not even come to court to 
find out what happened to his motion dated January 15, 1980 said 
plaintiff should not be allowed another postponement today for lack of 
interest of said party and this case be dismissed. </p>
  <p> "The Court noted that the motion for postponement dated January 
15, 1980 was not set for hearing which under the provision of Rule 15 
Section 4 should have been set for hearing because it does not contain 
the conformity of counsel for the other party.  It is likewise true that
 said movant should not have taken the liberality of the Court for 
granted by not coming at all to Court to find out what happened to his 
motion, and finally, since he asked that this case be set for hearing 
preferably on any date in March, 1980 with the incoming of the month of 
March he should have come to Court to find out what was the date set by 
the Court for the next hearing of this case.  This counsel for the 
plaintiff never did so.  For this negligence or lack of interest of the 
plaintiff this case is hereby ordered dismissed without findings as to 
costs.  Defendant also manifested that he has not reserved his right to 
present evidence on his counterclaim and will not pursue the same and 
therefore the Court will consider it dismissed without prejudice."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is to be noted that the order which is poorly composed does not 
categorically dismiss the plaintiff's claim with prejudice.  However, on
 a motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiff, the respondent 
judge issued another order, also badly composed, dated May 27, 1980, as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The order of the Court of March 18, 1980, dismissing this case 
with prejudice, but what was dismissed without prejudice was the 
counterclaim as the said order reveals.  However, the plaintiff alleges 
that the order of March 18, 1980 was received on April 1, 1980, and the 
motion for reconsideration was filed on April 17, 1980, then the Court 
has the obligation to pass upon the motion for reconsideration even 
though the movants did not appear in Court today. </p>
  <p> "For lack of merit, the motion for reconsideration is ordered denied."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With the above as factual background, the issue is whether or not the 
respondent judge committed a grave abuse of discretion when she 
dismissed the petitioner's complaint with prejudice upon its failure to 
appear for trial on March 13, 1980, as stipulated in the order of 
January 21, 1980.
</p><p>
The petition is impressed with merit; the respondent judge committed a 
grave abuse of discretion when she dismissed the petitioner's complaint 
with prejudice.
</p><p>
Petitioner's counsel was not aware of the order dated January 21, 1980, 
which re-set the case for trial on March 13, 1980.  He could not have 
been aware of the order precisely because he was not present on January 
21, 1980, having asked for postponement of the hearing on that day in 
view of the recent death of his mother.  And then again, although a copy
 of the order dated January 21, 1980, was sent to him by registered 
mail, the same was returned unclaimed.  The record is bereft of any 
indication that petitioner's counsel was at fault in this respect.
</p><p>
The respondent judge asserts that petitioner's counsel took the court 
for granted; that he should at least had gone to court "to find out what
 happened to his motion." Suffice it to state a lawyer has a right to be
 notified of a court order unless it is issued in open court in his 
presence.  In the case at bar there was lack of notice.
</p><p>
While We commend the spirit of the respondent judge to get the case 
moving speedily, the speed must be deliberate, not hasty.  The following
 quotations from Abinales vs. Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City,
 Branch I, et al., G.R. No. L-41530, April 30, 1976, 70 SCRA 590, 
595-597, are worth bearing in mind:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The reconsideration of the dismissal order becomes more proper 
when it is considered that trial courts have, after all, the duty to 
dispose of controversies after trial on the merits whenever possible.  
It is deemed an abuse of discretion for them, on their own motion, 'to 
enter a dismissal which is not warranted by the circumstances of the 
case.' While it is true that the dismissal of an action on grounds 
specified under Section 3, Rule 17 of the Revised Rules of Court is 
addressed to their discretion, such discretion must be exercised soundly
 with a view to the circumstances surrounding each particular case.  If 
facts obtain that serve as mitigating circumstances for the delay, the 
same should be considered and dismissal denied or set aside, especially 
where the suit appears to be meritorious and the plaintiff was not 
culpably negligent and no injury results to defendant."
  </p>
  <p>
  xxx                            xxx                               xxx
  </p>
  <p> "The policy of the courts to expedite disposal of cases and 
prevent clogging of dockets is well-nigh desirable.  Nonetheless, 
inconsiderate dismissals, even if without prejudice, do not constitute 
'a panacea nor a solution to the congestion of court dockets; while they
 lend a deceptive aura of efficiency to records of individual judges, 
they merely postpone the ultimate reckoning between the parties.  In the
 absence of clear lack of merit or intention to delay, justice is better
 served by a brief continuance, trial on the merits, and final 
disposition of the cases before the court.’ The desire to reduce docket 
congestion should not be allowed to justify the sacrifice of the 
substantial rights of the litigants.  Speed in judicial administration 
should not be promoted at the expense of justice, which is indispensable
 to any court system worthy of its name.  Any attempt to cut down on 
court congestion by dismissal of meritorious lawsuits 'is doomed to fail
 even in its misguided purpose of promoting speed in judicial 
administration,' because litigants with meritorious lawsuits are not 
likely to accept such rulings without exhausting all available appellate
 remedies.  As a result, any reduction of trial court dockets 
accomplished by such dismissals will be more than offset by the 
increased burden on appellate remedies.  As a result, any reduction of 
trial court dockets accomplished by such dismissals will be more than 
offset by the increased burden on appellate courts."
