				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
The question presented in this <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto </span>action is whether or not a 
public school district supervisor can be transferred from one district 
to another regardless of his consent.  The defunct Court of First 
Instance of Manila gave a negative answer.  The appellants assert that 
the answer should be in the affirmative.
<p>
The facts are simple enough:
</p><p>
On August 5, 1965, Bibiano G. Maderazo, the petitioner-appellee, was 
appointed Public Schools District Supervisor Range 41.  The appointment 
did not state the district where he was to discharge his duties but the 
stipulation of facts shows that he was originally assigned to the 
Caibiran District in Leyte.
</p><p>
In a letter dated July 9, 1966, Mauro Sabolboro, Leyte Division II 
Superintendent of Schools, informed Maderazo of "your transfer from 
Caibiran District to Biliran District as District Supervisor effective 
immediately."
</p><p>
Maderazo requested reconsideration of the order of transfer in no less 
than four letters sent to the Director of Public Schools but the order 
was not reconsidered.  In fact on March 7, 1967, Superintendent 
Sabolboro informed Maderazo that the Director of Public Schools had 
ordered the implementation of his transfer.
</p><p>
Maderazo had not been charged administratively prior to the transfer.
</p><p>
In Maderazo's letter dated March 10, 1967, addressed to the Secretary of
 Education wherein he asked for reconsideration of the order of the 
Director of Public Schools that the transfer be implemented, he stated, <em>inter alia</em>, "That I am now 61 years old and will retire in two years."
</p><p>
It is obvious that in this year of 1984, Maderazo's prayer that he be 
restored to his office in Caibiran has become moot and academic for the 
man is now well way beyond retirement age.  Maderazo wrote a letter 
dated February 23, 1984, asking for the early decision of his case.  In 
his letter he states, "I am now in my advanced age 79 years old, ailing 
and desirous that I will still be able to vindicate myself and enjoy the
 benefits or fruits of my labor."
</p><p>
What remains to be resolved is Maderazo's salary which was with­held 
because he refused the transfer on the ground that it was illegal for 
lack of consent on his part.
</p><p>
In deciding for Maderazo, the court a quo applied Republic Act No. 4670 
known as the Magna Carta of Public School Teachers.  The pro­visions of 
the law which are relevant to this case are the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 1.<em> Declaration of Policy.</em> - It is hereby 
declared to be the policy of this Act to promote and improve the social 
and economic status of public school teachers, their living and working 
conditions, their terms of employment and career prospects in order that
 they may compare favorably with existing opportunities in other walks 
of life, attract and retain in the teaching profession more people with 
the proper qualifications, it being recognized that advance in education
 depends on the qualifications and ability of the teaching staff and 
that education is an essential factor in the economic growth of the 
nation as a productive investment of vital importance. </p>
  <p> "Sec. 2.  <em>Title-Definition</em>. - This Act shall be known as 
the 'Magna Carta for Public School Teachers' and shall apply to all 
public school teachers except those in the pro­fessional staff of state 
colleges and universities. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As used in this Act, the term 'teacher' shall mean all persons engaged 
in classroom teaching, in any level of instruction, on full-time basis, 
including guidance counselors, school librarians, industrial arts or 
vocational instructors, and all other persons performing supervisory 
and/or administrative functions in all schools, colleges and 
universities ope­rated by the Government or its political subdivision; 
but shall not include school nurses, school physicians, school dentists,
 and other school employees.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 6.  <em>Consent for Transfer-Transportation Expenses</em>. -
 Except for cause and as herein otherwise provided, no teacher shall be 
transferred without his consent from one station to another. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Where the exigencies of the service require the transfer of a teacher 
from one station to another, such transfer may be effected by the school
 superintendent who shall previously notify the teacher concerned of the
 transfer and the reason or reasons therefor.  If the teacher believes 
there is no justification for the transfer, he may appeal his case to 
the Director of Public Schools, or the Director of Vocational Education,
 as the case may be.  Pending his appeal and the decision thereon, his 
transfer shall be held in abeyance:  Provided, however, That no 
transfers whatever shall be made three months before any local or 
national election.
</p><p>
Necessary transfer expenses of the teacher and his family shall be paid 
for by the Government if his transfer is finally approved."
</p><p>
It is manifest that the transfer of Maderazo from Caibiran to Biliran 
was contrary to the law because it was made without his consent and over
 his opposition.
</p><p>
The respondents contend, however, that R.A. No. 4670 was not yet in force when the transfer was made.  This is baseless.
</p><p>
R.A. No. 4670, according to its Section 35 took effect upon its 
approval.  It was approved on June 18, 1966, or before Maderazo was 
ordered transferred from Caibiran to Biliran.
</p><p>
The Act stipulates that "The Secretary of Education shall formulate and 
prepare the necessary rules and regulations to implement the provisions 
of this Act.  Rules and regulations issued pursuant to this Section 
shall take effect thirty days after publication in a newspaper of 
general circulation and by such other means as the Secretary of 
Education deems reasonably sufficient to give interested parties general
 notice of such issuance." (Sec. 30.) And the respondents claim that 
since the rules and regulations had not yet been published when Maderazo
 was transferred, the Act was not yet in force.  Wrong.  The Magna Carta
 covers a host of subjects which need elaboration by means of rules and 
regulations.  But there is nothing in Section 30 that would warrant a 
conclusion that the promulgation of the rules and regulations is a 
condition precedent to the effectivity of the Act. Section 6 of the Act 
requiring consent for transfer is enforceable without recourse to the 
rules and regulations.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the appeal is dismissed and judgment is hereby rendered 
ordering the respondents or their successors to pay the sala­ries of the
 petitioner from the time of his illegal transfer to the time he had to 
retire compulsorily. No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p><em> Makasiar, (Chairman), Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, De Castro</em> and <em>Escolin</em>,<em> JJ</em>., concur.
