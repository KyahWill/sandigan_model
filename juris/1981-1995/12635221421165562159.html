A Petition to review the Decision of the then Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. No. SP-14465-CAR entitled "Nicasio Parilla, et als., vs. Arturo 
Curso, et als.," which affirmed the judgment of the then Court of 
Agrarian Relations in Ormoc City declaring the forfeiture of the 
Certificates of Land Transfer of the fifteen (15) petitioners herein as 
well as of their respective farmholdings.
<p>
Petitioners are the agricultural lessees of irrigated rice and corn 
lands owned by private respondents, located at Barrio Capi√±ahan, Naval, 
Biliran sub-province, Leyte, with a total area of approximately 64 
hectares.  These lands have been placed under Operation Land Transfer 
(OLT) with Certificates of Land Transfer (CLT) having been issued to 
petitioners.
</p><p>
On 25 January 1982, the landowners, private respondents herein, 
commenced before the Court of Agrarian Relations, Ormoc City, Branch I, 
an action for the forfeiture of petitioners' Certificates of Land 
Transfer over the subject property based on petitioners' alleged failure
 to pay to private respondents the corresponding lease rentals for a 
period of more than two (2) years since 1978 in violation of Section 2 
of Presidential Decree No. 816, dated 21 October 1975, which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SECTION. 2.  That any agricultural lessee of a rice or corn land 
under Presidential Decree No. 27 who deliberately refuses and/or 
continues to refuse to pay the rentals or amortization payments when 
they fall due for a period of two (2) years shall, upon hearing and 
final judgment, forfeit the Certificate of Land Transfer, issued in his 
favor, if his farmholding is already covered by such Certificate of Land
 Transfer and his farmholding;"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In their Answer, petitioners justified their nonpayment by stating 
essentially that it was in accordance with MAR Memorandum Circular No. 
6, dated 28 February 1978 (MAR Circular, for short), and upon previous 
authorization from the MAR District Office; that they had deposited the 
rentals, instead, with the Land Bank; and that as the subject 
landholdings are covered by CLTs, it is the Ministry of Agrarian Reform 
(MAR) and not the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) that has 
jurisdiction over an action for forfeiture.  The pertinent provision of 
the MAR Circular referred to reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "<em>Payment of lease rentals to landowners covered by OLT<span class="style1">*</span> shall terminate on the date the value of the land is established</em>.  Thereafter, the tenant-farmers shall pay their lease rentals/amortizations to the LBP<span class="style1">**</span> or its authorized agents:  x x x (Italics supplied)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On 14 April 1982, the CAR rendered judgment on the pleadings declaring 
the forfeiture of petitioners' Certificates of Land Transfer and the 
turn-over of their landholdings to the Samahang Nayon pursuant to 
Section 4 of P.D. 816, for failure to pay lease rentals for a period of 
over two years.
</p><p>
On appeal, respondent Appellate Court affirmed the CAR judgment <em>in toto </em>stating:
</p><p>
"In view of the foregoing observations, the appellants' second, third, 
fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh assignments of errors must likewise 
fail.  The trial court correctly decided the case within the pale of PD 
816.  No prior referral of this case to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform 
was necessary, not only because the tenancy relationship between the 
parties was admitted in the pleadings, but, mainly because the law (P.D.
 No. 816) has allocated in the CAR the jurisdiction to hear this case.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is affirmed <em>in toto </em>without pronouncement as to costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, the instant Petition, with petitioners having been allowed to litigate as paupers.
</p><p>
By reason of the nature of petitioners' defenses, we considered the 
Minister of Agrarian Reform impleaded, required comment from the 
contending parties as well as from the Solicitor General, and eventually
 gave due course to the Petition.
</p><p>
The five assignments of error raised by petitioners may be compressed 
into two major issues as delineated by the Solicitor General:  (1) 
whether or not the CAR had jurisdiction over the action for forfeiture, 
and (2) whether or not the MAR Circular is inconsistent with, and 
violative of, Presidential Decree No. 816.
</p><p>
1.  There is no question that an action for forfeiture falls within the 
original and exclusive jurisdiction of the CAR as provided for by 
Section 5 of P.D. 816, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SECTION 5.  That any action for violation of the provisions of 
the preceding Sections 2 and 3 shall be cognizable by the Courts of 
Agrarian Relations which is hereby vested with original and exclusive 
jurisdiction to try and decide the same."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The related Section 2 of P.D. 816 has been quoted previously.
</p><p>
A subsequent law, P.D. 946, which took effect on 17 June 1976, similarly
 vested the CAR with exclusive and original jurisdiction over violations
 of P.D. Nos. 815 and 816, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SECTION 12.  <em>Jurisdiction over Subject Matter</em>.  - The Courts of Agrarian Relations shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over: </p>
  <p>
  x        x          x
  </p>
  <p> "(r) Violations of Presidential Decrees Nos. 815 and 816."
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> In fact, corollarily, Section 12, subparagraph (b) of P.D. 946 
spells out "matters exclusively cognizable by the Secretary (now 
Minister) of Agrarian Reform", to include: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p> "x x x </p>
    <p> "(b) (5) issuance, recall or cancellation of certificate of land
 transfer in cases outside the purview of Presidential Decree No. 816." 
(Italics supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It follows that an action for forfeiture of a Certificate of Land 
Transfer within the purview of P.D. No. 816 is not cognizable by the 
Ministry of Agrarian Reform.
</p><p>
Public and private respondents contend, however, that the CAR 
jurisdiction is subject to referral to, and a previous certification of,
 triability by, the MAR, pursuant to P.D. 316<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> , and substantially reiterated in Section 12 of P.D. 946.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
We disagree.  As pointed out by respondent Appellate Court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Clearly, this is not an action for ejectment of the defendants 
which requires a preliminary determination of the relationship between 
the contending parties.  Indeed, the prayer of the plaintiffs' complaint
 or petition in the lower Court did not ask for the ejectment of the 
appellants.  The prayer asks only for the forfeiture of the defendants' 
certificates of land transfer and for damages."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, there was no need for referral to the MAR since the tenancy 
relationship between the parties was admitted in the pleadings.  Neither
 is the subject matter of this action for forfeiture one of 
"harrassment" or "removal" of tenants, even if it be speciously argued 
that removal would eventually result from forfeiture.  Non-payment of 
rentals for a period of two years is clearly provided for as a ground 
for forfeiture of Certificates of Land Transfer and of the farmholdings 
involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
2.  The CAR was of the opinion that as between P.D. 816 and the MAR 
Circular, it is the former that should prevail.  Actually, we find no 
inconsistency nor incompatibility between them.  Of significance are the
 two "whereas" clauses of P.D. No. 816 quoted hereunder:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREAS, in the meanwhile that the implementing rules and 
regulations of Presidential Decree No. 27 have not yet been issued 
completely, the <em>status quo</em> shall be maintained between the 
parties, that is, the landowner shall continue to pay the land taxes 
thereon if the said Landholdings is not yet covered by Certificate of 
Land Transfer, while on the other hand the tenant-farmer who is now 
called <em>agricultural lessee shall continue to pay the rental to the landowner</em> whether or not his landholding planted to rice and corn is already covered by Certificate of Land Transfer; </p>
  <p> "WHEREAS, <em>such payment of rental shall continue until and after the valuation of the property shall have been determined </em>or
 agreed upon between the landowner and the Department of Agrarian Reform
 which, in turn, will become the basis for computing the amortization 
payment to be made by the agricultural lessee in 15 years with 6% 
interest per annum under Presidential Decree No. 27." (Italics supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Clearly, under P.D. No. 816, rentals are to be paid to the landowner by 
the agricultural lessee until and after the valuation of the property 
shall have been determined.
</p><p>
In the same vein, the MAR Circular provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Payment of lease rentals to landowners covered by OLT shall 
terminate on the date the value of the land is established.  Thereafter,
 the tenant-farmers shall pay their lease rentals/amortizations to the 
LBP<span class="style1">*</span> or its authorized agents x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    and
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The value of the land is established on the date the Secretary 
(now Minister) or his authorized representative has finally approved the
 average gross production data established by the Barangay Committee on 
Land Production (BCLP) or upon the signing of the LTPA<span class="style1">**</span> by landowners and tenant-farmers concerned heretofore authorized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, the MAR Circular merely provides guidelines in the 
payment of lease rentals/amortizations in implementation of P.D. 816.  
Under both P.D. 816 and the MAR Circular, payment of lease rentals shall
 terminate on the date the value of the land is established.  
Thereafter, the tenant farmers shall pay amortizations to the Land Bank 
(LBP).  The rentals previously paid are to be credited as partial 
payment of the land transferred to tenant-farmers.
</p><p>
Private respondent's contention that the MAR Circular amends or 
nullifies P.D. 816 in that the Circular deprives the land-owner of 
participation in the determination of the valuation of the land unlike 
the P.D. which provides for it, is without merit inasmuch as two 
representatives of the land-owners are represented in the Barangay 
Committee on Land Production (BCLP)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> ; the MAR Circular provides for the signing of a Land-owner-Tenant Production Agreement (LTPA) in the alternative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 ; besides the fact that the land-owners herein received notice of the 
valuation made by the BCLP and were asked to present their side of the 
case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Moreover, private respondents could have claimed for payment from the Land Bank but they did not.
</p><p>
In the case at bar, the valuation of the subject landholdings was 
already established on the basis of production data gathered by the 
Barrio Committee on Land Production (BCLP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  That valuation was approved by the Minister of Agrarian Reform on 16 August 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  Because of the approved valuation, and pursuant to the MAR Circular, 
petitioners requested authority from MAR to discontinue paying lease 
rentals to private respondents (Letter to Minister Estrella from 
petitioners dated 15 January 1979).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  MAR authorized petitioners to stop paying lease rentals to the 
landowners in a Resolution dated 25 January 1982 in MAR Case No. 82-015.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  Consequently, petitioners were no longer under obligation to pay 
rentals to private respondents as landowners.  Instead, petitioners 
deposited the corresponding amortizations with the Land Bank of the 
Philippines.
</p><p>
Presidential Decree No. 816 imposes the sanction of forfeiture where the "agricultural lessee x x x <em>deliberately</em>
 refuses and/or continues to refuse to pay the rentals or Amortization 
payments when they fall due for a period of two (2) years." Petitioners 
cannot be said to have <em>deliberately</em> refused to pay the lease 
rentals.  They acted in accordance with the MAR Circular, which 
implements P.D. 816, and in good faith.  Forfeiture of their 
Certificates of Land Transfer and of their farmholdings as decreed by 
the CAR and affirmed by the Appellate Court is thus unwarranted.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of forfeiture of petitioners' Certificates of 
Land Transfer rendered by the former Court of Agrarian Relations in 
Ormoc City in CAR Case No. 1915 and its affirmance by the then Court of 
Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 14465-CAR is hereby SET ASIDE.  No costs.
SO ORDERED.
