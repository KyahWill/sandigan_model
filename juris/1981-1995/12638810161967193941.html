 29, 1982</st1:date>, a dance was held in the school ground (plaza) of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Resurrection, <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="20" hour="10">10:20</st1:time>
of the same night, outside the dance hall, accused-appellant Elmo <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> was seen handing a machete to co-accused Dennis
Song who was under the influence of liquor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two accused entered the dance hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten minutes later, appellant <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span>, without a word, held Percival <span class="SpellE">Alcovendas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, accused Song approached the
victim slowly and stabbed him with a machete on the left side of his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the two assailants ran <span style="">away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The wounded Percival staggered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Albano</span> who
witnessed the stabbing, tried to help him but she could not do it<span style=""> </span>alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She called for help from the victim's relatives who were also at the
dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together they brought the still
ambulatory victim to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ticao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>District</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>

<p class="BODY">Percival was confined in the hospital for five days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the fifth <span style="">day, </span>he developed high fever and hypertension and died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His </span>body
was not autopsied due to the objections of his relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span>, the
attending physician, presented her diagnosis as:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of the preliminary examination conducted by the
municipal circuit judge on eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>, a warrant of arrest was issued for the capture of
Song and <span class="SpellE">LabriaÂ­ga</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The two were subsequently charged with the crime of murder in an information
filed with the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
now Regional Trial Court, Branch 46, on <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1982</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Song managed to elude arrest and the case was tried only with respect to <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision dated January 10, 1985, <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span>
was found guilty as charged and sentenced to <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> </span>and to <span style="">pay </span>the heirs of the deceased Percival <span class="SpellE">Alcovendas</span>
P12,000.00 as death indemnity and P20,000.00 as moral damages and the costs of
the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case against Song was
ordered archived until his capture.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, accused-appellant contends that the trial court
erred in convicting him of murder notwithstanding the fact that the stab wound
inflicted on the victim was not the proximate cause of his death, and also
because appellant's guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant appeal is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case for the prosecution was established by the eyewitness
accounts of <span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>
and Dominica <span class="SpellE">Alcovendas</span> who were present at the scene
of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> (<span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span>)
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Albano</span></st1:place>, a 37-year old
housewife and a sister-in-law of the deceased, testified that she was at the
dance on the night of the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was seated with some neighbors and children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The victim was then standing by a post, barely two meters away from
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw appellant approach
Percival, followed closely by accused Song.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without a word, appellant held Percival and then Song stabbed the victim
at the back with a machete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened
so quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no prior
altercation, no heated exchange between the protagonists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was unable to put up any
resistance.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> witnessed the violent
incident clearly because it occurred near a post where there was a lighted
mantle lamp.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other eyewitness, Dominica <span class="SpellE">Alcovendas</span>,
42 years old and elder sister of the deceased, corroborated the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
stated that before the stabbing inside the school plaza, she noticed that the
accused Song had been drinking gin at a nearby store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also saw the appellant <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> hand over a machete to Song who then placed the
weapon inside his pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Song
entered the dance hall, followed by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Dominica</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was about ten meters from Song when the latter knifed Percival who was then
being held by the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the milling crowd, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Dominica</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had an unobstructed view of the killing because there were four lighted mantle
lamps nearby.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Dominica</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had known the appellant for quite some time since they <span style="">are </span>both from <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense is denial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span>, 30 years old, fisherman, branded <span style="">as </span>completely false the statements of <span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Dominica</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that he held the victim while the other accused Song stabbed him with a
machete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant claimed that the two
alleged eyewitnesses were biased because of their close relationship with the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant did not deny that on
the evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1982</st1:date>
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time>, he was at the school
dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affair was sponsored by the
Out-of-School Youth Organization of which he was then the president.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the fatal altercation, appellant was at the stage making
some announcements on the microphone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
only found out about the incident when he noticed people scampering and at that
time he was approximately fifteen meters from the spot where Percival was
knifed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also admitted that
prior to <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1982</st1:date>,
there was no grudge or enmity between him and the two prosecution witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Darlie</span> Alvarez, the policeman
assigned to maintain peace and order at the dance on the night in question,
testified on behalf of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
declared that he questioned the victim Percival right after the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Percival told him that it was Song who
stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name of the appellant
was not mentioned at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alvarez wanted
to question Percival further but the victim was in a hurry to get to the
hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not err in giving more credence to the
version of the prosecution and in adjudging appellant guilty of the crime of
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant points out that when Pfc. Alvarez asked the victim as
to who wounded him right after the incident, the latter cateÂ­gorically stated
that it was Song.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never for an instance did
Percival implicate the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, as far as Percival was concerned, it was only Song and not the
appellant <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> who did him wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellant's assertion, the testimony of the police
officer does not create any doubt as to appellant's complicity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pfc. Alvarez asked Percival only once as the
latter wanted to be immediately brought to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Percival <span class="SpellE">Alcovendas</span>
was stabbed, what did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Somebody approached me and told me that a
person was stabbed and when I go near the place I saw Percival <span class="SpellE">Alcovendas</span> being assisted by a relative and so I asked him
who stab him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was his answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That he was stabbed by Dennis Song.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the only utterances that he made to
you, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was the only answer he made because when
I asked him who were the companions of the persons who stabbed him, he told me
that he should be brought to the Doctor immediately and he will just testify
when a complaint was already filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words you want to impress to this
Honorable Court that you were not able to conduct your investigation right
there and then?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No more because he was in a hurry to go to
the Doctor."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span style="">as </span>observed
by the trial court, if it were true that the victim had not denounced
appellant, why did Alvarez not exclude appellant's name from the complaint
filed in the MuniciÂ­pal Court when he was deputized to prosecute the criminal
case against Song and <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider the following testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Alforte</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And this particular case when this case was
tried preliminary investigation you were the one prosecuting, is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir as investigator we attended to it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And Dennis Song was. . . and Elmo <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> is one of the accused in this case?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> You did not move that the accused Elmo <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> be excluded?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Marcaida</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The
witness would be incompetent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Alforte</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I'll
reform Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Knowing that the victim in this case told
you that it was Dennis Song who stabbed him, why did you not exclude in your
complaint filed by your office Elmo <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I included him in the complaint because the
witness testified that he was seen holding the victim while this '<span class="SpellE">Bana</span>' was stabbing him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words somebody told you that Elmo
the accused was holding the victim when the victim was stabbed by the
co-accused Dennis Song, is that what you want to explain before this Honorable
Court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And can you remember who was that person who told
you that this Elmo <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> was holding the victim
when the victim was stabbed by Dennis Song?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could <span style="">not </span>tell whether it was <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> that
<span class="SpellE">Ningning</span> who stated."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Weighed against the denial of the appellant, the positive
identification made by <span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>
and Dominica <span class="SpellE">Alcovendas</span> deserves full belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The school plaza where the killing took place
was well lighted by several mantle lamps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Patrocino</span> was only two meters from the victim
while <st1:country-region><st1:place>Dominica</st1:place></st1:country-region>
stood ten meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both witnesses unerringly
identified and recognized the appellant whom they knew because they all resided
in the same <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant likewise raises the argument that the stab wound
inflicted by Song was not the proximate cause of <span class="SpellE">Percival's</span>
death, but rather the absence of proper medical treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant cites the fact that Percival was
"ambulatory with assistance" when he was admitted at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ticao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>District</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">argument </span>is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span> declared that the deceased died of acute peritonitis
secondary to the stab wound which <span style="">injured
his </span>intestines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acute
peritonitis was the direct and natural consequence of the three-inch deep stab
wound which perforated the victim's intestines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, this Court held in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span>,
62 Phil. 162, 169-170, citing 13 R.C.L., that:</p>

<blockquote>"While the courts may have vacillated from time to time it may
be taken to be the settled rule of the common law that one who inflicts an
injury on another will be held responsible for his death, although it may
appear that the deceased might have recovered if he had taken the proper care
of himself, or submitted to a surgical operation, or that unskilled or improper
treatment aggravated the wound and contributed to the death, or that death was
immediately caused by a surgical operation rendered necessary by the condition
of the wound.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The principle on which this rule is founded is one of
universal application, and lies at the foundation of all criminal
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, that every person
is to <span style="">be held to contemplate and to be
responsible for the natural consequences of his own acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a person inflicts a wound with a deadly
weapon in such a manner as to put life in jeopardy, and death follows as a
consequence of this felonious and wicked act, it does not alter its nature or
diminish its criminality to prove that other causes cooperated in producing the
fatal result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it may be said
that neglect of the wound or its unskillful and improper treatment, which are
of themselves consequences of the criminal act, which might naturally follow in
any case, </span>must in law be deemed to have been among those which were in
contemplation of the guilty party, and for which he is to be held responsible x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The crime is murder, with
appellant Elmo <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> and co-accused Dennis Song as
principals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing was attended by
the qualifying aggravating circumstance of treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fatal attack on the victim was deliberate
--- the appellant providing the murder weapon and the other accused making the
deadly thrust in a sudden and unexpected manner, catching the victim by
surprise and rendering him completely powerless to defend himÂ­self.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Song stabbed Percival while the latter was
held by <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two malefactors made sure that their prey would not be able to put
up a fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their concerted action shows
beyond any question that they conspired to kill Percival for a motive we </span>can
only speculate on.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds that the guilt of the
accused-appellant Elmo <span class="SpellE">Labriaga</span> has been established
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment
appealed from is hereby <span style="">AFFIRMED </span>with
the sole modification that the death indemnity of P12,00.00 is inÂ­creased to
