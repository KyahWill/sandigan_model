<p class="BODY">This is the sole issue for resolution in this case, the

<p class="BODY">Private respondent J.R. <span class="SpellE">Lithoplates</span>

<p class="BODY">It was stipulated in both the promissory note and the chattel
mortgage contract that in the event of failure to pay one (1) or two (2)
consecutive monthly installments, the entire balance shall become due and
payable and petitioner shall have the right to repossess the subject property
or <span style="">to </span>foreclose the chattel
mortgage, at its election.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent defaulted <span style="">i</span>n its payments to <span style="">petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioner demanded payment, or
the surrender of the above-described property for the purpose of foreclosure,
but despite repeated demands, private respondent was unable to comply
therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="2">February 22,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Presiding Judge <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> C. Vera-Cruz approved the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> that on <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1983</st1:date>, private respondent failed to pay the second
installment of <span style="">P23,000.00, in violation
of paragraph 2 of the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent, through its representative, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Ragiles</span>, requested petitioner for an extension of time to
pay as it was awaiting the release of its loan from the Integral Management and
Development Consultancy for thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00),</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> with which sum it intended </span>to pay

Petitioner admits that it granted private respondent, through counsel, only up
to <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1983</st1:date> to pay the
second <span style="">installment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner likewise admits that it made
inquiries into the said loan, but after learning that it would be approved only
upon submission of the necessary documents, and that there is no specific date
for its release, petitioner proceeded to file a motion for writ of execution
with the trial court on June 2, 1983.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent claims that when it
approached petitioner for an extension, it sought to get the same in writing,
but the counsel of petitioner assured the private respondent that the request
for extension can easily be accommodated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, private respondent <span style="">continues,
it did not persist in procuring the written extension and relied on the word of
counsel for petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent insists that petitioner was guilty of bad faith in filing the motion
for writ of execution despite the extension granted through counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the motion for execution was granted and a writ of
execution dated <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="6">June <span style="">7, </span>1983</st1:date> was accordingly <span style="">issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The very next day, private respondent filed an Urgent Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion to Recall the Writ of Execution, containing
all of the above allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
filed an opposition thereto, setting forth its own version as </span>aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the <span style="">writ </span>of execution was <span style="">implemented
by Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>
on </span><st1:date year="1983" day="10" month="6"><span style="">June 10, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="">,

<p class="BODY">Private respondent then filed a Manifestation alleging that the
writ of execution should be recalled on the ground that it had not yet been
enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner countered by manifesting
that the writ of execution had already been served and that the machine subject
matter of the writ had already been sold in accordance therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the trial court issued an Order dated June 30,
1983, denying the Motion to Recall the Writ of <span style="">Execution filed by private respondent.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1983</st1:date>,
private respondent filed a Notice of Appeal of the aforementioned Order of the
trial court, which was given due course, despite the opposition of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed in the
then Intermediate Appellate <span style="">Court (now
Court of Appeals) as CA-G.R. CV No. 02146.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had filed their respective briefs, the
respondent court rendered a decision dated February 28, 1985, recalling the
Writ of Execution issued by the trial court, ordering the petitioner to return
the printing press machine to private respondent, and ordering the latter to
pay its <span style="">entire obligation of FIFTY-SIX
THOUSAND PESOS (P56,000.00) to petitioner within one month from the finality of
the decision.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court found that a verbal extension of time to pay
was indeed granted by petitioner to private respondents on account of the fact
that petitioner made inquiries into the loan sought to be obtained by private <span style="">respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the decision of
the respondent court, which <span style="">was </span>denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner raises four assignments of error, namely that:</p>

<blockquote>“I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE <st1:street><st1:address>RESPONDENT

PERIOD OF PAYMENT OF THE OBLIGATION CONTRARY TO THE UNDISPUTED FACTS AND THE
FILING OF THE MOTION FOR EXECUTION;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“IV. THE <st1:street><st1:address>RESPONDENT COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
HAS ERRONEOUSLY EFFECTED A SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATION OR CHANGE IN THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF A COMPROMISE JUDGMENT ALREADY SATISFIED.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="color: black; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court of Appeals gravely erred when it reversed
the Order appealed from and recalled the Writ of Execution issued by the trial
court, for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">First, </span>as correctly
contended by petitioner, there is no longer anything to recall, as the writ of
execution had already been duly served and satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its recall has therefore, been rendered moot
and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, the compromise agreement executed by the parties and approved
by the trial court is controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
clear <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that a violation of any of its terms
and conditions shall entitle petitioner to the issuance of a writ <span style="">of </span>execution, with private respondent
waiving its right to notice and hearing of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well-settled is the rule that a judicial compromise has the force
of law and is conclusive between the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
A compromise has upon them the effect and authority of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></span></u><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Therefore, private respondent is bound
by the compromise agreement it entered into with petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since it defaulted on the payment of the
second installment, execution was properly sought by petitioner, and
accordingly issued by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third, a judgment based on a compromise is generally not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, <span style="">as </span>enunciated
in the ca<span style="">s</span>e <span style="">of <u>Serrano</u> <u>et</u> <u>al</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>vs</u></span> </span><u><span style="">Rey</span>es</u><span style=""> </span><u>et</u> <u>al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for the rule is that “when both parties enter into an agreement to
end a pending litigation and request that a decision <span style="">be </span>rendered approving said agreement, it is only natural to
presume that such action constitutes an implicit, as undeniable as an express,
waiver of the right to appeal against said decision”.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Granting that what was appealed in the instant case is the issuance of the writ
of execution and not the compromise agreement itself, the distinction is but
superficial because the questioned writ of execution was issued pursuant to the
compromise agreement and may be considered as part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Th<span style="">e</span>
net result is that the compromise agreement is what is <span style="">actually being appealed, specifically the provision on execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals clearly violated the
above-mentioned rule on the non-<span class="SpellE">appealability</span> of
judgments on compromise when it entertained the appeal of petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Fourth, what private respondent is actually trying to achieve by
seeking the recall of the writ of execution <span style="">is </span>to obtain judicial recognition of what would amount to a
modification of the compromise judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This modification refers to the alleged verbal grant of e<span style="">x</span>tension of time to pay the second
installment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged modification of the compromise judgment is a question
of fact, which the trial court presumably passed upon with adequacy during the <span style="">hearing </span>and proceedings to resolve the
Motion to<span style=""> </span>Recall the Writ of
Execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court should
therefore not have disturbed the finding of the trial court that there was no
such extension <span style="">as i</span><span style="">m</span><span style="">plied
in its appealed Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a
quo</u> is in the best position to determine said question, especially considering
that the judgment sought to be modified is based entirely on a compromise
agreement between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Time </span><span style="">and again We have ruled that the determination by the trial court is
entitled to the highest respect, and that as a general rule, appellate courts
will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the rule on modification of compromise judgments
clearly provides that if a court renders a judgment on compromise, it generally
cannot modify the compromise <u>unless the parties consent</u> (underscoring
supplied) or unless there is a hearing to determine the presence or absence of
vitiated consent.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Following <span style="">this </span>r<span style="">ule, </span><span style="">the court <u>a quo</u> could not</span> <span style="">have recognized the alleged extension which is the modification sought,
without the consent of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record of the case clearly shows that petitioner did not give its
consent to the requested extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, petitioner in fact opposed </span>the <span style="">same, as evidenced by its Opposition to the Motion to Recall the Writ of
Execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the fact that
petitioner filed for the issuance of a writ of execution indicates a clear
intent to abide by the terms of the compromise agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Fifth, there <span style="">was </span>no
reversible error on the part of the trial court when it held that the writ of
execution should not be recalled based on the mere allegation of a verbal
extension of time <span style="">of </span>payment
purportedly granted by <span style="">petitioner,
since such allegation is unsubstantiated by concrete evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only admissions made by petitioner are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that upon the request of private
respondent, it granted the latter a period of two days from May 30, 1983, or
until June <span style="">1, 1983, to pay the second
installment, and (2) that it made injuries into the loan being applied for by
private respondent, which the latter declared it would use to pay petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These admissions are not sufficient to hold that petitioner did
allow private respondent to pay only upon the release of the loan, thereby
modifying the approved compromise agreement, and removing the right of
petitioner to move for execution upon any default of payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of private respondent is that the verbal assurance
of accommodation given by the counsel of petitioner regarding its request for<span style=""> </span>extension is already <span style="">equivalent to a grant of said request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim is self-serving and entirely
uncorroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By no stretch of the
imagination can such assurance from the counsel of </span>petitioner quality as
a clear grant of extension.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sixth, the pronouncement of the appellate court that the fact
that petitioner made inquiries is conduct indicative of the fact that it really
granted an extension of time to pay i<span style="">s
erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inquiries made amounts to
an express </span>grant of extension no more than the verbal assurances of <span style="">accommodation made by the counsel of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inquiries into the release
of a</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">loan of one's debtor is only to be expected
of a concerned creditor, especially so if said loan is declared by the debtor
to be the sum from which the payment </span>of <span style="">the debt shall be taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This latter finding was based on Article 1371 of the New Civi<span style="">l </span><span style="">Code,
which declares that the contemporaneous </span>and <span style="">subsequent acts of the parties may be principally considered to judge
the intention of the contracting parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span>application of said article is improper because said
provision presupposes that the terms of a particular <span style="">contract are not clear; hence, there is a need to look at the intention
of the parties by other means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, there is no ambiguity in the terms of the approved compromise
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intention of the parties
is clear <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, petitioner <span style="">is </span>correct
in its assertion that the best proof that it granted no extension is the fact
that the very day after the lapse of the two-day "grace period" which
it granted to private respondent, petitioner immediately filed for the issuance
of a Writ of Execution pursuant to the terms of the compromise judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter prevails over any unproven
subsequent modification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of extension of private respondent is nothing but a
lame excuse for its failure to pay, and is not entitled to any
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the loan application
was really meant be a part of the compromise agreement, meaning that the second
installment should be paid on the agreed date on the condition that the loan
would be released by then, private respondent should have ensured that <span style="">it </span>be incorporated therein, or it
should not have signed the compromise agreement at all if it could <span style="">not </span>comply <span style="">therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, between a judgment based on a compromise agreement
voluntarily signed by the parties to a case, with the blessings of the trial
court, and an unsupported <span style="">allegation of
modification of said judgment by only one of the parties, the former must
prevail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it is worthy to note several points which
further weaken private respondent's position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has averred that notwithstanding the favorable decision of
the Court of Appeals to private respondent, the latter has not complied with
said decision, which was rendered almost six years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the balance of the debt due, or
FIFTY-SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P56,000.00), remains unpaid to this day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, private respondent failed to file
its comment to the instant petition, as well as its Memorandum, contrary to the
orders of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not
participated at all in the hearing of this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these reveal evident bad faith on <span style="">the </span>part of private respondent, further
justifying a judgment against it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition
is hereby GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the
respondent Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="2">February
