				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Isabelo&nbsp; Vicente appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan dated December 16, 1969, convicting him of murder, sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering him to pay an indemnity of P12,000 to the heirs of Nelson Ramirez.&nbsp; His co-accused, Teofilo de Leon, was acquitted.<br><br>Isabelo Vicente, 52, killed Nelson Ramirez, 36, the husband of his niece, Lita Vicente, in the eve足ning of December 7, 1967 in Natividad or Tayug, Panga足sinan.&nbsp; After the killing, Isabelo, accompanied by the mayor, surrendered to the chief of police.&nbsp; He told the chief of police that he had quarrelled with Nelson and that as the latter was going to stab him with a bolo (Exh. 4), he (Isabelo) shot Nelson with a shot足gun (Exh. C) in self-defense (2 tsn Sept. 8, 1969).<br><br>Motive for the killing was that Rizalina Vicente, 14, daughter of Isabelo, was an alleged concubine or paramour of Nelson, a fact which naturally angered Isabelo and his family (No. 20 Exh. E-2; 24 tsn Jan. 21, 1969; 13-14 tsn Feb. 19, 1969; 14 tsn Nov. 6, 1968).<br><br>The municipal health officer found that Nelson had four wounds caused by gunshots or buckshots; one wound shattered his skull and blew his brains out; the others were found on his left thigh, left shoulder and left ribs (Exh. A and B).<br><br>Another autopsy conducted by a hospital physician revealed that Nelson had <i>contusions on the chest, abdomen and extremities, swelling with ecchymosis on the penis and swelling with dislocation of the interphalan足geal joints </i>of the right-hand fingers in addition to the four gunshot wounds already mentioned.&nbsp; The stomach, liver, left kidney, lungs and diaphragm were perforated (Exh. D).<br><br>Isabelo was charged with homicide in the municipal court (Exh. 6).&nbsp; Later, an amended complaint for murder was filed against Isabelo, his son Francisco and Teofilo de Leon.&nbsp; The parents, brothers and sisters of Nelson alleged that other persons were involved in the killing of Nelson "under mysterious circumstances" (Exh. I).&nbsp; In the Court of First Instance, only Isabelo and De Leon were charged with murder.<br><br>Did Isabelo act in self-defense?&nbsp; He could have proven self-defense during the preliminary investigation, but he did not present any evidence at that stage.<br><br>His story was that he arrived in the vicinity of his house at <i>about</i> eight o'clock on that fateful evening of December 7, 1967.&nbsp; He was riding in a calesa driven by his neighbor Teofilo de Leon.&nbsp; He had drunk much basi.&nbsp; He could not drive the calesa because he was intoxicated.<br><br>His house was about seven meters from Nelson's house.&nbsp; As the calesa neared their houses, it touched the wire used as clothesline strung between a <i>caimito</i> tree and a bamboo post of Nelson's house and caused it to snap off.&nbsp; Nelson's house was shaken.&nbsp; He was eating supper at the time.&nbsp; He went down with a flashlight and berated Isabelo.<br><br>Then, Nelson got his bolo and chased Isabelo.&nbsp; The latter took refuge in his house followed by Nelson.&nbsp; Isabelo got his shotgun and ran downstairs through the kitchen.&nbsp; Nelson took another route.&nbsp; He reached the ground where he encountered Isabelo near the <i>caimito</i> tree.&nbsp; As Nelson, who was five and a half feet tall, raised his bolo to stab Isabelo who was five feet only, the latter retreated and stumbled over the sugarcane stalks unloaded from the calesa.<br><br>Nelson rushed to hack the fallen Isabelo with his bolo but the latter was able to press the trigger of his shotgun, hitting Nelson on the left breast.&nbsp; Isabelo was able to get up.&nbsp; He shot Nelson two more times (3-5 Norada's brief).<br><br>A different version was given by Lita Vicente.&nbsp; In her tape-recorded declaration, she said that Isabelo and De Leon did not arrive in the vicinity of their houses and Nelson's house at around <i>eight o'clock</i> in the evening of December 7, 1967.<br><br>Isabelo and his son Francisco arrived at around <i>eleven o'clock</i> that evening in the calesa driven by De Leon.&nbsp; They carried the dead body of Nelson and dumped it near the <i>caimito</i> tree between the houses of Isabelo and Nelson.&nbsp; Then, as already noted, Isabelo shot the cadaver of Nelson three times.&nbsp; He later went up the Nelson house, got his bolo and flashlight and placed them near Nelson's body (2-11 tsn Nov. 6, 1968).&nbsp; This version renders incredible the reenactment made by Isabelo as shown in the photographs, Exhibit J to J-17.<br><br><i>We hold that self-defense was not proven in this case.</i>&nbsp; As observed by the trial court Isabelo was not wounded at all.&nbsp; It would be difficult to believe that Nelson, an intelligent man, would have faced Isabelo while the latter was pointing a gun at him.&nbsp; He should have known that a bolo was an inadequate weapon against a shotgun.<br><br>The trial court also noted that Isabelo had not explained why Nelson had multiple contusions on his chest, abdomen and extremities and <i>swellings with ecchymosis on his penis</i> and right-hand fingers.&nbsp; Also, it cannot be true that Isabelo frontally shot Nelson.&nbsp; There was no frontal gunshot wound.<br><br>However, in the absence of proof as to how Nelson was killed, the killing must be considered as homicide and not murder.&nbsp; The circumstance qualifying the killing as murder must be proven as indubitably as the killing itself (<i>U. S. vs. Sellano,</i> 10 Phil. 498; <i>U. S. Bisandre,</i> 40 Phil. 78).<br><br>Isabelo is guilty of homicide with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to the authorities.&nbsp; The maximum of his indeterminate penalty should be taken from reclusion temporal minimum.&nbsp; The minimum should be taken from prision mayor.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's decision is modified.&nbsp; Isabelo Vicente is convicted of homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years of prision mayor as minimum to fourteen (14) years of reclusion temporal.&nbsp; He is ordered to pay the heirs of Nelson Ramirez an indemnity of P30,000.&nbsp; Costs de oficio.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Concepcion, Jr., (Chairman), Abad Santos, Escolin, Cuevas,</i> and <i>Alampay, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
