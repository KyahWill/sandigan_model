				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The computation of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to be
paid to the herein private respondents is in issue in this petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record of the case discloses the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 29, 1986, the private respondents filed a complaint for
illegal dismissal against their employer, the herein petitioner Fortune Tobacco
Corporation before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) praying that
they be reinstated in the company with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and without loss of seniority rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case was docketed as NLRC Case No. 1-381-86.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The parties <span style="">submitted </span><span style="">their respective position papers </span>with
the petitioner maintaining that it had already sold its <span class="SpellE">redrying</span>
plant as of <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time, the labor arbiter to whom the
case was assigned rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondent (herein petitioner) is hereby ordered
to reinstate the individual complainants (herein private respondents) to their
former position(s) with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> reckoned from
October 5<span style="">, </span>1985 <span style="">u</span>p to actual reinstatement, or, in the
alternative, to pay each of the complainants their separation pay equivalent at
least to one month salary for every year of service, whichever is higher a
fraction <span style="">of six </span>months being
considered as one whole year, and for purposes <span style="">of </span>computing said benefit, the usual or normal seasonal period of
one (1) calendar year shall be treated as one (1) whole year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed the said decision of the labor arbiter to
the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1989</st1:date>, the NLRC promulgated its
resolution modifying the decision appealed from, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"And considering that as alleged by the respondent without any
contravention from the complainants that the plant had already been sold,
respondent-appellant must pay separation pay to all those who opt not to be
rehired by the new owner of the plant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent?appellant must also pay the complainants' <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> <u><span style="">from </span></u><st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="10"><u>October 5, 1985</u></st1:date><u> up to the
date the plant was actually sold</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> must be computed by taking into
consideration the nature of complainants work as seasonal period in one (1)
calendar year should be treated as one (1) whole year (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, except for the above modification the decision
sought to be reversed should be as it is hereby AFFIRMED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Costs against respondent-appellant."
(Emphasis supplied.)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner went to this Court in G.R. No. 89477 by way of a
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was, however,
dismissed in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="9">September
 4, 1989</st1:date> issued by the Second Division of this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the decision of the NLRC became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1990</st1:date>,
the Research and Information Unit of the NLRC came up with its
"Computation of <span class="SpellE">Backwages</span> and Separation
Pay" pursuant to the decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The amount stated in the computation<span style=""> is </span>P3,863,464.89.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said amount was apparently reached by
reckoning the computation period to start from <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="10">October <span style="">5, </span>1985</st1:date>
up to August 1990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The research unit
also stated that it took into account this period because the date of the
actual sale of the plant is not ascertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1990</st1:date>,
in a hearing set up for the purpose, the petitioner was given ample time to
establish by way of competent proof the date of the actual sale of the plant
and its facilities cited in the final <span style="">and
</span><span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision of the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 7, 1990, the petitioner filed
its manifestation to which was attached a certified copy of the "Deed of
Conditional Sale" executed by and between the petitioner and Premium
Tobacco <span class="SpellE">Redrying</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fluecuring</span>
Company, Inc. (PTRFC) dated October 17, 1985.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner also attached its own computation of the amounts which
should be paid the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fine, the petitioner has taken the position that the date of the
actual sale of the plant and its facilities is <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1985</st1:date> and as such the amount stated in the
computation of the research unit of the NLRC should be substantially reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 29, 1990, the private respondents filed their
"Opposition to Manifestation" with annexes showing a certification
from the Office of the Municipal Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>,
Metro Manila, a copy of a Declaration of Real Property and an affidavit of one
of the complainants in this case alleging that there was no actual sale of the
plant and its facilities to the alleged vendee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The opposition alleges, among others, that there was no actual transfer
or actual sale of the plant and its facilities in favor of the PTRFCI; that
only a change in name and form has been undertaken by the petitioner; that the
properties are still declared in the name of the petitioner; that the PTRFCI
representative, a certain Mr. Angelo <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, is the
plant manager of the <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> plant of the petitioner; that the control,
management, operation and funding of the plant are in the hands of the
petitioner notwithstanding the alleged sale; and that the computation made by
the NLRC is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed its comment/rejoinder on <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1990</st1:date>, alleging therein
that the sale <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1985</st1:date> is valid and that
the property remains in the name of the petitioner pending the full payment of
the purchase price agreed upon by the vendor and the vendee.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 26, 1990, Labor Arbiter Ramon Reyes issued an order
holding, among others, that there was no actual sale between the petitioner and
the PTRFCI; that the Deed of Conditional Sale entered into by the said parties
does not state any consideration; and that no actual sale has taken place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this observations, the labor arbiter <span style="">went </span>on to declare that the computation
of the research unit of the NLRC in the amount <span style="">of </span>P3,863,464.89 is in accord with the resolution of the said
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1990</st1:date>,
the labor arbiter issued a writ of execution directing the Acting Sheriff of
the NLRC to collect the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> amount of
P3,863,464.89 from the petitioner in satisfaction of its obligation or to cause
the full satisfaction of the same out of the chattels of the immovable
properties of the petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner elevated the case to this Court by way of the
instant petition with the same arguments raised before the NLRC recited
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner prays for the
issuance of <span style="">a </span>temporary
restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of the petition is that the
computation made by the NLRC is attended with grave abuse of discretion and
thus, the writ of execution should not be enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner also argues that the award of
damages should be limited to cover a three?year period only, in
accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1990</st1:date>,
this Court resolved to issue a temporary restraining order enjoining the
private respondents from enforcing the challenged writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner filed a bond in the amount of
P100,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General, as counsel for the NLRC,
filed its comment praying therein for the dismissal of the petition on the
ground that no jurisdictional infirmity attended the issuance of the challenged
writ of execution because there is no actual sale of the plant and its
facilities up <span style="">to </span>the present
time.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court eventually resolved to give due course to the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the parties filed the
required pleadings, the case was deemed submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the resolution of the NLRC dated <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1989</st1:date>, which was for all intents and
purposes sustained by this Court as explained earlier, the petitioner is
required to, among others, pay the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of the
private respondents for the period covering <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1985</st1:date> up to the time the plant and its
facilities are actually sold.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner maintains that the plant and its facilities were
sold on <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1985</st1:date>
by virtue of the Deed of Conditional Sale, bearing the same date, executed by
the petitioner and the PTRFCI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus put,
the petitioner contends that the amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to be paid to the private respondents should be based on the period covering <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="10">October 5 to 17, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the private respondents
maintain that there has been no actual sale of the plant and its facilities up
to the present time and as such the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to be
paid should be computed accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
NLRC shares the view of the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that there <span style="">is
</span>no <u>actual</u> sale <span style="">of </span>the
plant and its facilities up to the present time.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the Deed of Conditional Sale was executed on <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1985</st1:date>, it does not
necessarily follow that the plant and its facilities were, <u><span style="">ipso</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facto</span></u><span style="">, </span>sold on that <span style="">very </span>day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
portions of the said document are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon execution <span style="">of </span>this Deed the PROPERTIES shall be deemed transferred to the
possession of the VENDEE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ownership,
however, over the PROPERTIES shall be retained by the VENDOR until the VENDEE
shall have paid in full the purchase price stipulated in Article I hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The VENDEE shall not, in the meantime, sell,
lease, let or otherwise encumber or dispose of the PROPERTIES or assign its
rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
VENDOR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any disposition made in
violation of this article shall be void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The VENDOR, upon full payment by the VENDEE
of the unpaid balance of the purchase price inclusive of interest charges above
specified will execute and deliver to the VENDEE a final or absolute deed of
sale over the PROPERTIES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">DEFAULT AND </span>FORFEITURE</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in case the VENDEE fails to make timely
payment as specified above, or fails to perform any of the covenants or
agreements hereof, this contract shall, at the exclusive option the VENDOR, be
annulled and in such event, all payments made by the VENDEE by virtue of this
contract shall be automatically forfeited and retained by the VENDOR as rental
payments for the use of said <span style="">PROPERTIES </span>and/or
liquidated damages sustained by it as a result of the <span class="SpellE">VENDEE's</span>
default; and the VENDEE shall forthwith surrender the possession and custody of
the PROPERTIES to the VENDOR."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A careful evaluation of the stipulations of the said agreement
will readily show that the petitioner has no intention to transfer ownership
over the plant and its facilities to the vendee unless there is full payment of
the purchase price on the part of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, it is clearly stipulated that ownership over the plant and its
facilities will be transferred to the vendee by way of "a final and
absolute deed of sale" only after such full payment, inclusive of interest
charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms and conditions of the
agreement speak for themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, even accepting that the plant and its facilities have been sold on a <u>conditional</u>
basis, there can be no <u><span style="">actual</span></u><span style=""> </span>sale thereof unless the plant and its
facilities are <u>unconditionally</u> conveyed to the PTRFCI by virtue of
"a final or absolute deed of sale" in accordance with the terms and
conditions stated in the agreement between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General manifests that the tax records of the
petitioner as well as the certification issued by the Municipal Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> reveal that the plant is still registered in the
name of the petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The Solicitor General points out that under these circumstances, the petitioner
may not validly contend that there has been an <u>a</u><u><span style="">ctual</span></u><span style=""> </span>sale of the plant and its facilities to the PTRFCI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These observations are well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, however, correctly asserts that the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be limited to cover a three-year period,
and, <u>a</u> <u><span style="">fortiori</span></u><span style="">, </span>any award in excess of such period
is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention finds
support in prevailing jurisprudence.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
A modification <span style="">is, </span>therefore, in
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to be paid to the private respondents should not exceed a period covering three
years, computed from <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to be
paid to the private respondents should, however, not exceed a period covering
three (3) years, computed from <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="10">October
