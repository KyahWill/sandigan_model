This is a petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>of a Court of 
Appeals' decision which reversed the trial court's judgment of 
conviction and acquitted the petitioners of the crime of grave coercion 
on the ground of reasonable doubt but inspite of the acquittal ordered 
them to pay jointly and severally the amount of P9,000.00 to the 
complainants as actual damages.
<p>
The petitioners were charged under the following information:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The undersigned Fiscal accused ROY PADILLA, FILOMENO GALDONES, 
PEPITO BEDEÑA, YOLLY RICO, DAVID BERMUNDO, VULLANOAC, ROBERTO ROSALES, 
VILLANIA, ROMEO GARRIDO, JOSE ORTEGA, JR., RICARDO CELESTINO, REALINGO 
alias "KAMLON", JOHN DOE alias TATO, and FOURTEEN (14) RICARDO DOES of 
the crime of GRAVE COERCION, committed as follows: </p>
  <p> "That on or about February 8, 1964 at around 9:00 o'clock in the 
morning, in the municipality of Jose Panganiban, province of Camarines 
Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
 the above-named accused, Roy Padilla, Filomeno Galdones, Pepito Bedeña,
 Yolly Rico, David Bermundo, Villanoac, Roberto Rosales, Villania, Romeo
 Garrido, Jose Ortega, Jr., Ricardo Celestino, Realingo alias Kamlon, 
John Doe alias Tato, and Fourteen Richard Does, by confederating and 
mutually helping one another, and acting without any authority of law, 
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, by means of 
threats, force and violence prevent Antonio Vergara and his family to 
close their stall located at the Public Market, Building No. 3, Jose 
Panganiban, Camarines Norte, and by subsequently  forcibly opening the 
door of said stall and thereafter brutally demolishing and destroying 
said stall and the furnitures therein by axes and other massive 
instruments, and carrying away the goods, wares and merchandise, to the 
damage and prejudice of the said Antonio Vergara and his family in the 
amount of P30,000.00 in concept of actual or compensatory and moral 
damages, and fur­ther the sum of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages. </p>
  <p> "That in committing he offense, the accused took advantage of 
their public positions:  Roy Padilla, being the incumbent municipal 
mayor, and the rest of the accused being policemen, except Ricardo 
Celestino who is a civilian, all of Jose Panganiban Camarines Norte, and
 that it was committed with evident premeditation."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte, Tenth Judicial District 
rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which states that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Roy Padilla,
 Filomeno Galdonez, Ismael Gonzalgo and Jose Parley Bedeña guilty beyond
 reasonable doubt of the crime of grave coercion, and hereby imposes 
upon them to suffer an imprisonment of FIVE (5) months and One (1) day; 
to pay a fine of P500.00 each; to pay actual and compensatory damages in
 the amount of P10,000.00; moral damages in the amount of P30,000.00; 
and another P10,000.00 for exemplary damages, jointly and severally, and
 all the accessory penalties provided for by law; and to pay the 
proportionate costs of this proceedings. </p>
  <p> "The accused Federico Realingo alias 'Kamlon', David Bermudo, 
Christopher Villoac, Godofredo Villania, Romeo Garrido, Roberto Rosales,
 Ricardo Celestino and Jose Ortega, are hereby ordered acquitted on 
grounds of reasonable doubt for their criminal participation in the 
crime charged."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The petitioners appealed the judgment of conviction to the Court of 
Appeals.  They contended that the trial court's finding of grave 
coercion was not supported by the evidence.  According to the 
petitioners, the town mayor had the power to order the clearance of 
market premises and the removal of the complainants' stall because the 
municipality had enacted municipal ordinances pursuant to which the 
market stall was a nuisance per se.  The petitioners stated that the 
lower court erred in finding that the demolition of the complainants' 
stall was a violation of the very directive of the petitioner Mayor 
which gave the stall owners seventy two (72) hours to vacate the market 
premises.  The petitioners questioned the imposition of prison terms of 
five months and one day and of accessory penalties provided by law.  
They also challenge the order to pay fines of P500.00 each, P10,000.00 
actual and compensatory damages, P30,000.00 moral damages, P10,000.00 
exemplary damages, and the costs of the suit.
</p><p>
The dispositive portion of the decision of the respondent Court of Appeals states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, we hereby modify the judgment appealed from in the 
sense that the appellants are acquitted on ground of reasonable doubt, 
but they are ordered to pay jointly and severally to complainants the 
amount of P9,600.00, as actual damages."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration contending that the 
acquittal of the defendants-appellants as to criminal liability results 
in the extinction of their civil liability.  The Court of Appeals denied
 the motion holding that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "x x x ‘appellants' acquittal was based on reasonable doubt — 
whether the crime of coercion was committed, not on facts that no 
unlawful act was committed; as their taking the law into their hands, 
destructing (sic) complainants' properties is unlawful, and, as evidence
 on record established that complainants suffered actual damages, the 
imposition of actual damages is correct. "
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Consequently, the petitioners filed this special civil action, contending that:
</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center">
THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR OF LAW OR GRAVELY ABUSED

</p><p align="center">
THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN ORDERING THE PETITIONERS HEREIN, 
APPELLANTS IN CA-G.R. NO. 13456-CR, JOINTLY, AND SEVERALLY, TO PAY 
COMPLAINANTS P9,600.00 IN SUPPOSED ACTUAL DAMAGES.
</p><p>
The issue posed in the instant proceeding is whether or not the 
respondent court committed a reversible error in requiring the 
petitioners to pay civil indemnity to the complainants after acquitting 
them from the criminal charge.
</p><p>
Petitioners maintain the view that where the civil liability which is 
included in the criminal action is that arising from and as a 
consequence of the criminal act, and the defendant was acquitted in the 
criminal case, (no civil liability arising from the criminal case), no 
civil liability arising from the criminal charge could be imposed upon 
him.  They cite precedents to the effect that the liability of the 
defendant for the return of the amount received by him may not be 
enforced in the criminal case but must be raised in a separate civil 
action for the recovery of the said amount (People v. Pantig, 97 Phil. 
748; following the doctrine laid down in Manila Railroad Co. v. 
Honorable Rodolfo Baltazar, 49 O.G. 3874; Pueblo contra Abellera, 69 
Phil. 623; People v. Mañago, 69 Phil. 496; People v. Miranda, 5 SCRA 
1067; Aldaba v. Elepaño, 116 Phil. 457).
</p><p>
In the case before us, the petitioners were acquitted not because they 
did not commit the acts stated in the charge against them.  There is no 
dispute over the for­cible opening of the market stall, its demolition 
with axes and other instruments, and the carting away of the 
mer­chandize.  The petitioners were acquitted because these acts were 
denominated coercion when they properly constituted some other offense 
such as threat or malicious mischief.
</p><p>
The respondent Court of Appeals stated in its decision:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "For a complaint to prosper under the foregoing provision, the 
violence must be employed against the person, not against property as 
what happened in the case at bar.  x x x. </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "The next problem is:  May the accused be convicted of an offense other than coercion? </p>
  <p>
  From all appearances, they should have been prosecuted either for 
threats or malicious mischief.  But the law does not allow us to render 
judgment of conviction for either of these offenses for the reason that 
they were not indicted for these offenses.  The information under which 
they were prosecuted does not allege the elements of either threats or 
malicious mischief.  Although the information mentions that the act was 
'by means of threats', it does not allege the particular threat made.  
An accused person is entitled to be informed of the nature of the acts 
imputed to him before he can be made to enter into trial upon a valid 
information.
  </p>
  <p> "We rule that the crime of grave coercion has not been proved in accordance with law. </p>
  <p> "While appellants are entitled to acquittal, they nevertheless are
 civilly liable for the actual damages suffered by the complainants by 
reason of the demolition of the stall and loss of some of their 
properties.  The extinction of the penal action does not carry with it 
that of the civil, unless the extinction proceeds from a declaration in a
 final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise did not 
exist.  (Rule 111, Sec. 3(c), Rev. Rules of Court; Laperal v. Aliza, 51 
OG.R. 1311, People v. Velez, 44 OG. 1811).  In the instant case, the 
fact from which the civil might arise, namely, the demolition of the 
stall and loss of the properties contained therein; exists, and this is 
not denied by the accused.  And since there is no showing that the 
complainants have reserved or waived their right to institute a separate
 civil action, the civil aspect therein is deemed instituted with the 
criminal action.  (Rule 111, Sec. 1, Rev. Rules of Court). </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Section 1 of Rule 111 of the Rules of Court states the fundamental 
proposition that when a criminal action is instituted, the civil action 
for recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged is 
impliedly instituted with it.  There is no implied institution when the 
offended party expressly waives the civil action or reserves his right 
to institute it separately.  (Morte Sr. v. Alvizo, Jr., 101 SCRA 221).
</p><p>
The extinction of the civil action by reason of acquittal in the 
criminal case refers exclusively to civil liability ex delicto founded 
on Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code.  (Elcano v. Hill, 77 SCRA 98; 
Virata v. Ochoa, 81 SCRA 472).  In other words, the civil liability 
which is also extinguished upon acquittal of the accused is the civil 
liability arising from the act as a crime.
</p><p>
As early as 1942, the Supreme Court speaking through Justice Jorge 
Bocobo in Barredo v. Garcia, et al. 473 Phil. 607 laid down the rule 
that the same punishable act or omission can create two kinds of civil 
liabilities against the accused and, where provided by law, his 
employer.  There is the civil liability arising from the act as a crime 
and the liability arising from the same act as a quasidelict.  Either 
one of these two types of civil liability may be enforced against the 
accused.  However, the offended party cannot recover damages under both 
types of liability.  For instance, in cases of criminal negligence or 
crimes due to reckless imprudence, Article 2177 of the Civil Code 
provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Responsibility for fault or negligence under the preceding 
article is entirely separate and distinct from the civil liability 
arising from negligence under the Penal Code.  But the plaintiff cannot 
recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the defendant"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Section 3(c) of Rule 111 specifically provides that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 3.  <em>Other civil actions arising from offenses</em>.- In all cases not included in the preceding section the following rules shall be observed: </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p>
    (c)    Extinction of the penal action does not carry with it 
extinction of the civil, unless the extinction proceeds from a 
declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil might
 arise did not exist.  In other cases, the person entitled to the civil 
action may institute it in the jurisdiction and in the manner provided 
by law against the person who may be liable for restitution of the thing
 and reparation or indemnity for the damage suffered.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The judgment of acquittal extinguishes the liability of the accused for 
damages only when it includes a declaration that the facts from which 
the civil might arise did not exist.  Thus, the civil liability is not 
extinguished by acquittal where the acquittal is based on reasonable 
doubt (PNB v. Catipon, 98 Phil. 286) as only preponderance of evidence 
is required in civil cases; where the court expressly declares that the 
liability of the accused is not criminal but only civil in nature (De 
Guzman v. Alvia, 96 Phil. 558; People v. Pantig, supra) as, for 
instance, in the felonies of estafa, theft, and malicious mischief 
committed by certain relatives who thereby incur only civil liability 
(See Art. 332, Revised Penal Code); and, where the civil liability does 
not arise from or is not based upon the criminal act of which the 
accused was acquitted (Castro v. Collector of Internal Revenue, 4 SCRA 
1093; See Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium, 1983 ed., p. 623).
</p><p>
Article 29 of the Civil Code, also provides that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "When the accused in a criminal prosecution is acquitted on the 
ground that his guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, a 
civil action for damages for the same act or omission may be instituted.
  Such action requires only a preponderance of evidence.  Upon notion of
 the defendant, the court may require the plaintiff to file a bond to 
answer for damages in case the complaint should be found to be 
malicious. </p>
  <p> "If in a criminal case the judgment of acquittal is based upon 
reasonable doubt, the court shall so declare.  In the absence of any 
declara­tion to that effect, it may be inferred from the text of the 
decision whether or not the acquittal is due to that ground."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
More recently, we held that the acquittal of the defendant in the 
criminal case would not constitute an obstacle to the filing of a civil 
case based on the same acts which led to the criminal prosecution:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x The finding by the respondent court that he spent said sum 
for and in the interest of the Capiz Agricultural and Fishery School and
 for his personal benefit is not a declaration that the fact upon which 
Civil Case No. V-3339 is based does not exist.  The civil action barred 
by such a declaration is the civil liability arising from the offense 
charged, which is the one impliedly instituted with the criminal action.
  (Section I, Rule III, Rules of Court.) Such a declaration would not 
bar a civil action filed against an accused who had been acquitted in 
the criminal case if the criminal action is predicated on factual or 
legal considerations other than the commission of the offense charged.  A
 person may be acquitted of malversation where, as in the case at bar, 
he could show that he did not misappropriate the public funds in his 
possession, but he could be rendered liable to res­tore said funds or at
 least to make a proper accounting thereof if he shall spend the sane 
for purposes which are not authorized nor intended, and in a manner not 
permitted by applicable rules and regulations." (Republic v. Bello, 120 
SCRA 203) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There appear to be no sound reasons to require a separate civil action 
to still be filed considering that the facts to be proved in the civil 
case have already been established in the criminal proceedings where the
 accused was acquitted.  Due process has been accorded the accused.  He 
was, in fact, exonerated of the criminal charged.  The constitutional 
presumption of innocence called for more vigilant efforts on the part of
 prosecuting attorneys and defense counsel, a keener awareness by all 
witnesses of the serious implications of perjury, and a more studied 
consideration by the judge of the entire records and of applicable 
statutes and precedents.  To require a separate civil action simply 
because the accused was acquitted would mean needless clogging of court 
dockets and unnecessary duplication of litigation with all its attendant
 loss of time, effort, and money on the part of all concerned.
</p><p>
The trial court found the following facts clearly established by the evidence adduced by both the prosecution and the defense:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "(9)  In the morning of February 8, 1964, then Chief Galdones, 
complying with the instructions contained in said Memorandum No. 32 of 
the Mayor, and upon seeing that Antonio Vergara had not vacated the 
premises in question, with the aid of his policemen, forced upon the 
store or stall and ordered the removal of the goods inside the store of 
Vergara, at the same time taking inventory of the goods taken out, piled
 them outside in front of the store and had it cordoned with a rope, and
 after all the goods were taken out from the store, ordered the 
demolition of said stall of Antonio Vergara.  Since then up to the trial
 of this case, the whereabouts of the goods taken out from the store nor
 the materials of the demolished stall have not been made known."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The respondent Court of Appeals made a similar finding that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On the morning of February 8th, because the said Vergaras had not
 up to that time complied with the order to vacate, the co-accused Chief
 of Police Galdones and some members of his police force, went to the 
market and, using ax, crowbars and hammers, demolished the stall of the 
Vergaras who were not present or around, and after having first 
inventoried the goods and merchandise found therein, they had them 
brought to the municipal building for safe­keeping.  Inspite of notice 
served upon the Vergaras to take possession of the goods and merchandise
 thus taken away, the latter refused to do so. </p>
  <p> "The loss and damage to the Vergaras as they evaluated them were: </p>
  <table width="90%" align="center" border="0">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td>Cost of stall construction</td>
      <td>P 1,300.00 </td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value of furniture and equipment destroyed</td>
      <td>300.00 </td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value of goods and equipment taken</td>
      <td><u>8,000.00 </u></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>P9,600.00 </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>
  <p> "It is not disputed that the accused demolished the grocery stall 
of the complainants Vergaras and carted away its contents.  The defense 
that they did so in order to abate what they considered a nuisance per 
se is untenable.  This finds no support in law and in fact.  The couple 
has been paying rentals for the premises to the government which allowed
 them to lease the stall.  It is, therefore, far-fetched to say that the
 stall was a nuisance per se which could be summarily abated. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The petitioners, themselves, do not deny the fact that they caused the 
destruction of the complainant's market stall and had its contents 
carted away.  They state:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On February 8, 1964, despite personal pleas on Vergaras by the 
Mayor to vacate the passageways of Market Building No. 3, the Vergaras 
were still in the premises, so the petitioners Chief of Police and 
members of the Police Force of Jose Panganiban, pursuant to the Mayor's 
directives, demolished the store of the Vergaras, made an inventory of 
the goods found in said store, and brought these goods to the municipal 
building under the custody of the Municipal Treasurer, x x x."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The only supposed obstacle is the provision of Article 29 of the Civil 
Code, earlier cited, that "when the accused in a criminal prosecution is
 acquitted on the ground that his guilt has not been proved beyond 
reasonable doubt, a civil action for damages for the same act or 
omission may be instituted." According to some scholars, this provision 
of substantive law calls for a separate civil action and cannot be 
modified by a rule of remedial law even in the interests of economy and 
simplicity and following the dictates of logic and common sense.
</p><p>
As stated by retired Judge J. Cezar Sangco:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x if the Court finds the evidence sufficient to sustain the 
civil action but inadequate to justify a conviction in the criminal 
action, may it render judgment acquitting the accused on reasonable 
doubt, but hold him civilly liable nonetheless?  An affirmative answer 
to this question would be consistent with the doctrine that the two are 
distinct and separate actions, and will (a) dispense with the 
reinstituting of the same civil action, or, one based on quasidelict or 
other independent civil action, and of presenting the same evidence; (b)
 save the injured party unnecessary expenses in the prosecution of the 
civil action or enable him to take advantage of the free services of the
 fiscal; and (c) otherwise resolve the unsettling implications of 
permitting the reinstitution of a separate civil action whether based on
 delict, or quasidelict, or other independent civil actions. </p>
  <p> "x x x But for the court to be able to adjudicate in the manner 
here suggested, Art. 29 of the Civil Code should be amended because it 
clearly and expressly provides that the civil action based on the same 
act or omission may only be instituted in a separate action, and 
therefore, may not inferentially be resolved in the same criminal 
action.  To dismiss the civil action upon" acquittal of the accused, and
 disallow the reinstitution of any other civil action, would likewise 
render, unjustifiably, the acquittal on reasonable doubt without any 
significance, and would violate the doctrine that the two actions are 
distinct and separate. </p>
  <p> "In the light of the foregoing exposition, it seems evident that 
there is much sophistry and no pragmatism in the doctrine that it is 
inconsistent to award in the same proceedings damages against the 
accused after acquitting him on reasonable doubt.  Such doctrine must 
recognize the distinct and separate character of the two actions, the 
nature of an acquittal on reasonable doubt, the vexatious and oppressive
 effects of a reservation or institution of a separate civil action, and
 that the injured party is entitled to damages not because the act or 
omission is punishable but because he was damaged or injured thereby 
(Sangco, Philippine Law on Torts and Damages, pp. 288-289). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We see no need to amend Article 29 of the Civil Code in order to allow a
 court to grant damages despite a judgment of acquittal based on 
reason-able doubt.  What Article 29 clearly and expressly provides is a 
remedy for the plaintiff in case the defendant has been acquitted in a 
criminal prosecution on the ground that his guilt has not been proved 
beyond reasonable doubt.  It merely emphasizes that a civil action for 
damages is not precluded by an acquittal for the same criminal act or 
omission.  The Civil Code provision does not state that the remedy can 
be availed of only in a separate civil action.  A separate civil case 
may be filed but there is no statement that such separate filing is the 
only and exclusive permissible mode of recovering damages.
</p><p>
There is nothing contrary to the Civil Code provision in the rendition 
of a judgment of acquittal and a judgment awarding damages in the same 
criminal action.  The two can stand side by side.  A judgment of 
acquittal operates to extinguish the criminal liability.  It does not, 
however, extinguish the civil liability unless there is clear showing 
that the act from which civil liability might arise did not exist.
</p><p>
A different conclusion would be attributing to the Civil Code a trivial 
requirement, a provision which imposes an uncalled for burden before one
 who has already been the victim of a condemnable, yet non-criminal, act
 may be, accorded the justice which he seeks.
</p><p>
We further note the rationale behind Art. 29 of the Civil Code in 
arriving at the intent of the legislator that they could not possibly 
have intended to make it more difficult for the aggrieved party to 
recover just compensation by making a separate civil action mandatory 
and exclusive:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The old rule that the acquittal of the accused in a criminal case
 also releases him from civil liability is one of the most serious flaws
 in the Philippine legal system.  It has given rise to numberless 
instances of miscarriage of justice, where the acquittal was due to a 
reasonable doubt in the mind of the court as to the guilt of the 
accused.  The reasoning followed is that inasmuch as the civil 
responsibility is derived from the criminal offense, when the latter is 
not proved, civil liability cannot be demanded. </p>
  <p> "This is one of those cases where confused thinking leads to 
unfortunate and deplorable consequences.  Such reasoning fails to draw a
 clear line of demarcation between criminal liability and civil 
responsibility, and to determine the logical result of the distinction. 
 The two liabilities are separate and distinct from each other.  One 
affects the social order and the other, private rights.  One is for the 
punishment or correction of the offender while the other is for 
reparation of damages suffered by the aggrieved party.  x x x It is just
 and proper that, for the purposes of the imprisonment of or fine upon 
the accused, the offense should be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  But 
for the purpose of indemnifying the complaining party, why should the 
offense also be proved beyond reasonable doubt?  Is not the invasion or 
violation of every private right to be proved only by preponderance of 
evidence?  Is the right of the aggrieved person any less private because
 the wrongful act is also punishable by the criminal law?  (Code 
Commission, pp. 45-46). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A separate civil action may be warranted where additional facts have to 
be established or more evidence must be adduced or where the criminal 
case has been fully terminated and a separate complaint would be just as
 efficacious or even more expedient than a timely remand to the trial 
court where the criminal action was decided for further hearings on the 
civil aspects of the case.  The offended party may, of course, choose to
 file a separate action.  These do not exist in this case.  Considering 
moreover the delays suffered by the case in the trial, appellate, and 
review stages, it would be unjust to the complainants in this case to 
require at this time a separate civil action to be filed.
</p><p>
With this in mind, we therefore hold that the respondent Court of 
Appeals did not err in awarding damages despite a judgment of acquittal.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, we hereby AFFIRM the decision of the respondent Court of Appeals and dismiss the petition for lack of merit.
