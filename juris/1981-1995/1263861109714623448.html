petitions seek the review of the amended decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. SP Nos. 05604 and 05617 which set aside the earlier decision dated June
5, 1986, of the then Intermediate Appellate Court and directed that in all
subsequent elections for directors of Sanitary Wares Manufacturing Corporation
(<span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span>), American Standard Inc. (ASI) cannot
nominate more than three (3) directors; that the Filipino stockholders shall
not interfere in <span class="SpellE">ASI's</span> choice of its three (3)
nominees; that, on the other hand, the Filipino stockholders can nominate only
six (6) candidates and in the event they cannot agree on the six (6) nominees,
they shall vote only among themselves to determine who the six (6) nominees
will be, with cumulative voting to be allowed but without interference </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from ASI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The antecedent facts can
be summarized as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In 1961, <span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span>, a domestic corporation was incorporated for the
primary purpose of manufacturing and marketing sanitary wares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the incorporators, Mr. Baldwin Young
went abroad to look for foreign partners, European or American who could help
in its expansion plans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On August 15,
1962, ASI, a foreign corporation domiciled in Delaware, United States entered
into an Agreement with <span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span> and some Filipino
investors whereby ASI and the Filipino investors agreed to participate in the
ownership of an enterprise which would engage primarily in the business of
manufacturing in the Philippines and selling here and abroad vitreous china and
sanitary wares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties agreed that
the business operations in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> shall be carried on by an incorporated
enterprise and that the name of the corporation shall initially be
"Sanitary Wares Manufacturing Corporation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The Agreement has the
following provisions relevant to the issues in these cases on the nomination
and election of the directors of the corporation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">"3. <u>Articles</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><u>Incorporation</u> </p>

be substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A and, insofar as
permitted under Philippine law, shall specifically provide for</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">"5. <u>Management</u></p>

<blockquote>(a) The management of the Corporation shall be vested in a Board of
Directors, which shall consist of nine individuals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As long as American-Standard shall own at
least 30% of the outstanding stock of the Corporation, three of the nine
directors shall be designated by American-Standard, and the other six shall be
designated by the other stockholders of the Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 51 &amp; 53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>
of 75875)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the request of ASI, the agreement contained provisions
designed to protect it as a minority group, including the grant of veto powers
over a number of corporate acts and the right to designate certain officers, such
as a <span class="GramE">member</span> of the Executive Committee whose vote was
required for important corporate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">transactions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, the 30% capital stock of ASI was increased to 40%.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The corporation was also registered with the
Board of Investments for <span class="SpellE">availment</span> of incentives with
the condition that at least 60% of the capital stock of the corporation shall
be owned by Philippine nationals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The joint enterprise thus entered into by the Filipino investors
and the American corporation prospered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, with the business successes, there came a deterioration
of the initially harmonious relations between the two groups.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the Filipino group, a basic
disagreement was due to their desire to expand the export operations of the
company to which ASI objected as it apparently had other subsidiaries or joint
venture groups in the countries where Philippine exports were
contemplated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1983</st1:date>, the annual stockholders' meeting
was held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The meeting was <span class="GramE">presided</span> by Baldwin Young.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The minutes were taken by the Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After disposing of the preliminary
items in the agenda, the stockholders then proceeded to the election <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the members of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">board of directors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The </span>ASI group <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">nominated three </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">persons
namely; Wolfgang <span class="SpellE">Aurbach</span>, John Griffin and David P. <span class="SpellE">Whittingham</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Philippine investors nominated six, namely; Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>,
Sr., Raul A. <span class="SpellE">Boncan</span>, Ernesto R. <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>,
Jr., George F. Lee, and Baldwin Young.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Eduardo R. <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span> then nominated Mr. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> E. Salazar, who in turn nominated Mr. Charles <span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
chairman, Baldwin Young ruled the last two nominations out of order on the
basis of section 5 (a) of the Agreement, the consistent practice of the parties
during the past annual stockholders' meetings to nominate only nine persons as
nominees for the nine-member board of directors, and the legal advice of <span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span>' legal counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The following events then, transpired:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were protests against the action of the
Chairman and heated arguments ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
appeal was made by the ASI representative to the body of stockholders present
that a vote be taken on the ruling of the Chairman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Chairman, Baldwin Young, declared the
appeal out of order and no vote on the ruling was taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Chairman then instructed the Corporate
Secretary to cast all the votes present and represented by proxy equally for
the 6 nominees of the Philippine Investors and the 3 nominees of ASI, thus
effectively excluding the 2 additional persons nominated, namely, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> E. Salazar and Charles <span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ASI <span class="SpellE">reprentative</span>,
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Jaqua</span>, protested the decision of the Chairman and
announced that all votes accruing to ASI shares, a total of 1,329,695 (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, AC-G.R. SP No. 05617) were being cumulatively voted
for the three ASI nominees and Charles <span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span>, and
instructed the Secretary to so vote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> E. Salazar and other proxy holders announced that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">all </span>the votes owned by and or
represented by them 467,197 shares (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
AC-G.R. SP No.05617) were being voted cumulatively in favor of <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> E. Salazar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Chairman, Baldwin Young, nevertheless instructed the Secretary to
cast all votes equally in favor of the three ASI nominees, namely, Wolfgang <span class="SpellE">Aurbach</span>, John Griffin and David <span class="SpellE">Whittingham</span>,
and the six originally nominated by Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Vinluan</span>,
namely, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>, Sr., Raul <span class="SpellE">Boncan</span>, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>, Jr.,
Enrique <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>, George F. Lee, and Baldwin
Young.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary then certified for
the election of the following -- Wolfgang <span class="SpellE">Aurbach</span>,
John Griffin, David <span class="SpellE">Whittingham</span>, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>, Sr., Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>,
Jr., Enrique <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>, George F. Lee, Raul A. <span class="SpellE">Boncan</span>, <span class="GramE">Baldwin</span> Young.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The representative of ASI then moved to
recess the meeting which was duly seconded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was also a motion to adjourn (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Ac-G.R. SP No. 05617).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This motion to
adjourn was accepted by the Chairman, Baldwin Young, who announced that the
motion was carried and declared the meeting adjourned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Protests against the adjournment were
registered and having been ignored, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Jaqua</span>, the
ASI representative, stated that the meeting was not adjourned but only recessed
and that the meeting would be reconvened in the next room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Chairman then threatened to have the
stockholders who did not agree to the decision of the Chairman on the casting
of votes bodily thrown out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ASI
Group, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> E. Salazar and other stockholders,
allegedly representing 53 or 54% of the shares of <span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span>,
decided to continue the meeting at the elevator lobby of the <st1:place><st1:placename>American</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Standard</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The continued meeting was <span class="GramE">presided</span>
by <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> E. Salazar, while Andres <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> acted as Secretary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the cumulative votes cast
earlier in the meeting, the ASI Group nominated its four nominees:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wolfgang <span class="SpellE">Aurbach</span>,
John Griffin, David <span class="SpellE">Whittingham</span> and Charles <span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Luciano</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>E. Salazar voted for himself, thus
the said five directors were certified as elected directors by the Acting
Secretary, Andres <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>, with the explanation
that there was a tie among the other six (6) nominees for the four (4)
remaining positions of directors and that the body decided not to break the
tie." (pp. 37-39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of 75975-76)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">These incidents triggered
off </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">filing of separate
petitions by the parties </span>with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first petition filed was for preliminary injunction by <span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span>, Ernesto V. </span><span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>,
Baldwin Young, Raul A. <span class="SpellE">Boncan</span>, Ernesto R. <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>, Jr., Enrique <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span>
and George F. Lee against <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> Salazar and Charles
<span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
case was denominated as SEC Case No. 2417.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The second petition was for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and
application for receivership by Wolfgang <span class="SpellE">Aurbach</span>,
John Griffin, David <span class="SpellE">Whittingham</span>, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
E. Salazar and Charles <span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span> against the group of
Young and <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span> (petitioners in SEC Case No. 2417)
and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> F. Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The case was docketed as SEC Case No. 2718.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both sets of parties except for <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> Cruz claimed to be the legitimate directors of the
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two petitions were consolidated and tried jointly by a
hearing officer who rendered a decision upholding the election of the <span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span> Group and dismissing the quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
petition of Salazar and <span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ASI Group and Salazar appealed the
decision to the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> which affirmed the hearing officer's
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The SEC decision led to the filing of two separate appeals with
the Intermediate Appellate Court by Wolfgang <span class="SpellE">Aurbach</span>,
John Griffin, David <span class="SpellE">Whittingham</span> and Charles <span class="SpellE">Chamsay</span> (docketed as AC-G.R. SP No. 05604) and by <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> E. Salazar (docketed as AC-G.R. SP No.05617). The
petitions were consolidated and the appellate court in its decision ordered the
remand of the case to the Securities and Exchange Commission with the directive
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that a new stockholders' meeting of <span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span> be </span>ordered convoked as soon as possible,
under the supervision of the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a motion for reconsideration filed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> (<span class="SpellE">Lagdameo</span> Group) the
appellate court (Court of Appeals) rendered the questioned amended decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The ASI Group's argument
is correct within the context of Section 24 of the Corporation Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The point of query, however, is whether or
not that provision is applicable to a joint venture with clearly defined
agreements:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The legal concept of a joint venture is of common law
origin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has no precise legal
definition, but it has been generally understood to mean an organization formed
for some temporary purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Gates v. <span class="SpellE">Megargel</span>, 266 Fed. 811 [1920]) It is in fact hardly
distinguishable from the partnership, since their elements are similar -
community of interest in the business, sharing of profits and losses, and a
mutual right of control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Blackner</span> v. <span class="SpellE">MCDermott</span>, 176 F. 2d.

</span>The main distinction cited by most opinions in common law jurisdictions
is that the partnership contemplates a general business with some degree of
continuity, while the joint venture is formed for the execution of a single
transaction, and is thus of a temporary nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

this jurisdiction, since under the Civil Code, a partnership may be particular

undertaking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1783, Civil
Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would seem therefore that under
Philippine law, a joint venture is a form of partnership and should thus be
governed by the law of partnerships.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Supreme Court has however recognized a distinction between these two business
forms, and has held that although a corporation cannot enter into a partnership

<p class="BODY">Bearing these principles in mind, the correct view would be that
the resolution of the question of whether or not the ASI Group may vote their
additional equity lies in the agreement of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Necessarily, the appellate court was correct in upholding the
agreement of the parties as regards the allocation of director seats under
Section 5 (a) of the "Agreement," and the right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>each group of stockholders to
cumulative voting in the process of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">determining
who the group's nominees would be under Section 3 (a) (1) of the
"Agreement." As pointed out by SEC, Section 5 (a) of the Agreement
relates to the manner of nominating the members of the board of </span>directors
while Section 3 (a) (1) relates to the manner of voting for these nominees.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the proper interpretation of the Agreement of the parties
as regards the election of members of the board of directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">To allow the ASI Group to vote their additional equity to help
elect even a Filipino director who would be beholden to them would obliterate
their minority status as agreed upon by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated by the appellate court:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ASI, however, should not be
allowed to interfere in the voting within the Filipino group. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, ASI would be able to designate more
than the three directors it is allowed to designate under the Agreement, and
may even be able to get a majority of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">board
seats, a </span>result which is clearly contrary to the contractual intent of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">parties.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Such a ruling will give effect to both the allocation of the
board seats and the stockholder's right to cumulative voting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this ruling will also give due
consideration to the issue raised by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> on
possible violation or circumvention of the Anti-Dummy Law (Com. Act No. 108, as
amended) and the nationalization requirements of the Constitution and the laws
if ASI is allowed to nominate more than three directors." (At p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, 75875)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Equally important as the
consideration of the contractual intent of the parties is the consideration as
regards the possible domination by the foreign investors of the enterprise in
violation of the nationalization requirements enshrined in the Constitution and
circumvention of the Anti-Dummy Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this regard, petitioner Salazar's position is that the Anti-Dummy Act allows
the ASI group to elect board directors in proportion to their <u>share</u> <u>in</u>

entity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the foreign
Group (ASI) was limited to designate three directors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the allowable participation of the
ASI Group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in future dealings,
this limitation of six to three board </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

maintained as long as the joint venture agreement exists </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">considering that in limiting 3 board seats in
the 9-man board of directors there are provisions already agreed upon and
embodied in the parties' Agreement to protect </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">With these findings, we affirm the decisions of the SEC Hearing
Officer and SEC which were impliedly affirmed by the appellate court declaring

object to a cumulative voting during the election of the board of directors of
the enterprise as ruled by the appellate court and submits that the six (6)
directors allotted the Filipino stockholders should be selected by consensus
pursuant to section 5 (a) of the Agreement which uses the word
"designate" meaning </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"<u>nominate</u>,

<p class="BODY">They also stress the possibility that the ASI Group might take
control of the enterprise if the Filipino stockholders are allowed to select
their nominees separately and not as a common slot determined by the majority
of their group.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 (a) of the Agreement which uses the word <u>designates</u>
in the allocation of board directors should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">not be interpreted in isolation. This should be construed in relation
to section 3 (a) (1) of the Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As we stated earlier, section 3(a<span class="GramE">)(</span>1) relates
to the <u>manner</u> <u>of</u> <u>voting</u> for these nominees which is <u>cumulative</u>
<u>voting</u> while section 5(a) relates to the <u>manner</u> <u>of</u> <u>nominating</u>
<u>the</u> <u>members</u> of the board of directors. The petitioners in G. R.
No. 75951 agreed </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">this
procedure, hence, they cannot now impugn its legality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The insinuation that the
ASI Group may be able to control the enterprise under the cumulative voting
procedure cannot, however, be ignored.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The validity of the cumulative voting procedure is dependent on the
directors thus elected being genuine members of the Filipino group, not voters
whose interest is to increase the ASI share in the management of <span class="SpellE">Saniwares</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The joint
venture character of the enterprise must always be taken into account, so long
as the company exists under its original agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cumulative voting may not be used as a device
to enable ASI to achieve stealthily or indirectly what they cannot accomplish
openly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are substantial safeguards
in the Agreement which <span class="GramE">are</span> intended to preserve the
majority status of the Filipino investors as well as to maintain the minority
status of the foreign investors group as earlier discussed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They should be maintained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
