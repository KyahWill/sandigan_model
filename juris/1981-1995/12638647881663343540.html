convicting the accused-appellant, Simeon Castro of the crime of Murder,
qualified by treachery, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Court

<blockquote>The Court further finds that the prosecu­tion failed to establish
the guilt of the ac­cused Rodrigo Sales and Cresencio Siazon be­yond reasonable

oficio.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant was charged with three others by the Provincial
Fiscal of Cagayan with the crime of Murder in an information dated April 25,
1968 alleging the offense to have been committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about November 24, 1965, in the municipality of
Gattaran, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the said accused Simeon Castro, Conrado Rodrigo, Cresencio Siazon and
Rodrigo Sales, together with Wilson Stacy who is already dead, armed with guns,
conspiring together and helping one another, with intent to kill, with evident
premeditation and with treachery, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously assault, attack and shoot one Rodrigo Elizaga Sabado, inflicting
upon him several gun-shot wounds on his body, which wounds caused his death.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>That <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>the
commission of the crime the aggravating circumstance of taking advan­tage of
official position was present, the accused being all Municipal Policemen of
Gattaran, at the time of the incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Wilson Stacy also a policeman, was included in the criminal
complaint filed with the Municipal Court of Gattaran by the Provincial
Investigator of the Cagayan Constabulary Command of Tuguegarao, Cagayan (Crim.
Case Record, p. 1) but he died during the preliminary investigation of the case
(Crims. Case Record, p. 203) and the case against him was dismissed by the
Municipal Court (Crim. Case Record, p. 207).  Accused Conrado Rodrigo died on November 15, 1971 (Crim. Case Record, p.
700) and the case against him was also dismissed (Decision, p. 2).</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the witnesses of the prosecution as summarized
by the lower court are as follows:  (1)
Felix Caranza testified on direct examination that when Cresencio Siazon,
Rodrigo Sales and Conrado Rodrigo arrived in the scene of the crime, shortly
after Wilson Stacy and Simeon Castro shot Rodrigo Sabado, they fired their guns
into the air but on further questions of the Court and on cross?examination
of the defense, he gave conflicting statements to the effect that the three
accused (Rodrigo Sales, Cresencio Siazon and Conrado Rodrigo) fired their guns
ten times and that some were directed into the air and some at Rodrigo Sabado;
that five shots were fired by Conrado Rodrigo at Sabado, although he cannot
remember how many shots were fired by Cresencio Siazon to the later because when
the three accused were firing into the air and at the deceased, he hid in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">canal </span>(Rollo, p. ???); (2) Rolando
dela Cruz <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mangupag, </span>another eye
witness who corroborated the testimony of Felix Caranza stated that shortly
after Wilson Stacy and Simeon Castro shot Rodrigo Sabado, the three accused
arrived and each of them shot the victim several times and that Conrado Rodrigo
and Cresencio Siazon used a carbine in shooting Sabado while Rodrigo Sales used
a side arm.  (Rollo, p. 10) and (3) Dr.
Tomas L. Nolasco, the Medical Health Officer of Gattaran, Cagayan who performed
the post mortem examination and autopsy stated that Rodrigo Sabado died from
two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(2) </span>gunshot wounds and as
testified by said Dr. Tomas L. Nolasco the cause of death were gunshot wounds
of the lungs and heart (Rollo, p. 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presented three witnes­ses in
addition to the three accused; (1) Simeon Castro who made a complete denial as
to his participation in the commission of the crime.  On the contrary, he alleged that he witnessed the killing of
Rodrigo Sabado by Wilson Stacy who told him that Rodrigo Sabado wanted to kill
him (Stacy) and that he saw Wilson Stacy shoot Rodrigo Sabado twice.  Thereafter, he took Wilson Stacy to the
municipal building and accused Conrado Rodrigo went with them.  He denied the testimonies of Felix Caranza
and Rolando dela Cruz Mangupag and stated that Caranza was not at the scene of
the crime although he admitted that Mangupag was with the deceased at the time
of the incident (Rollo, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">p. </span>11);
(2) Cresenclo Siazon and Rodrigo Sales put up the defense of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">alibi; </span>(3) Bernardo Farinas, Chief of
Police of Gattaran, Cagayan who testified on the entries in the police blotter
stating that Rodrigo Sabado was shot by Wilson Stacy (Hearing Jan. 25, 1972 Tsn
pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">7-22); (4) </span>Judge Romarico
who corroborated the alibi of Rodrigo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sales
</span>that the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>present
at the program held in Gattaran Elementary School from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. of
that day, maintaining order thereat; and (5) Juana Lacerma who corroborated the
alibi of Cresencio Siazon that the latter was in the balcony of his house from
6:00 to 9:00 p.m. of November 24, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">give
</span>weight to the testimony of Felix Caranza which it describes as
vacillating and doubtful and therefore not sufficient evidence to support
convic­tion beyond reasonable doubt.  Likewise, the testimony of Rolando dela Cruz Mangupag, although positive
according to the trial court, gives the impression that the inculpatory facts
and circumstances are susceptible to two explanations, one favorable to the
accused and the other one against.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the physical facts established by Dr. Tomas L.
Nolasco that the victim sustained four gunshot wounds which were attributed to
the shots fired by Wilson Stacy and Simeon Castro, the trial court came to the
conclu­sion that the three accused Cresencio Siazon, Rodrigo Sales and Conrado
Rodrigo did not fire their guns at the deceased but in the air.  (Rollo, pp. 10-18)</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the trial court acquitted Rodrigo Sales and Cresencio
Siazon on the ground that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">prosecution
</span>failed to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but convic­ted
accused Simeon Castro of the crime of Murder qualified by treachery, as defined
and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, accused-appellant, through his counsel de oficio,
Atty. Leon L. Asa of the Laurel Law Office, assigns the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

203 /1984/; (People v. Royeras, 130 SCRA 259 /1984/; (People v. Tala, 141 SCRA

overlooked certain facts of substance and value which if considered would
affect the result of the case, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the witness stand, Dr. Nolasco testified that the gunshot
wound under paragraph 2 of paragraph B (upper extremities), gunshot wound left
and near the elbow joint, was the exit of the gunshot wounds a and b under
paragraph 1, right upper extremities and that the gunshot wound of entrance and
exit found on paragraph C-thorax is the continuation of the gunshot wound under
paragraph B-upper extremities.  Thus,
the three (3) gunshot wounds were caused by only one bullet from a 38-caliber
gun which was recovered imbedded at the thorax side of the left arm.  This would be the bullet that caused the
death of the victim by causing injury to his lungs and heart.  The second bullet also coming from
38-caliber gun, found its mark on the left thigh of the victim where it was
recovered.  He testified:</p>

Chief of Police of Gattaran who was then the police desk sergeant at the time
when the incident happened, at about 7:00 and 8:00 o'clock in the evening of
November 24, 1965, the late Patrolman Wilson Stacy reported to him that he
(Stacy) shot one Rodrigo Sabado at the cafeteria or restaurant just in front of
the public market of Gattaran (Tsn, Sept. 14, 1972, p. 25).  He identified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">the </span>entry on page 5 (Exh. 4-C), police blotter, as the one
written by then Cpl. Rodrigo Sales about the incident, and the signature below
the entry as that of then Chief <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>Police
Bonifacio de la Pena.  It was the policy
of Chief of Police de la Pena that only the corporal would make the entries in
the police blotter (Tsn, Ibid, p. 9, 13-14).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Corporal Rodrigo Sales testified on that particular entry in the
police blotter as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Now,
also on page 104 at the bottom, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">appears
a bracketed portion already marked as Exh. 4-C, will you please read and tell
the Court what is all about, Wilson Stacy reported in this Office that he shot </span>to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">death the person of Rodriqo Sabado at
8:00 and according to said Patrolman Stacy, he tried to aim a shot to said policeman.  Do you know who wrote that?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was the one who wrote that, sir."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Tsn, September 14,
1972, p. 30)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sales made the entry in the blotter, at around 10:00 o'clock p.m.
of the same date of the incident (Tsn, June 29, 1972, p. 161).  He testified that the investigation was made
by the Chief of Police who called for him to enter the report in the police
blotter.  He was then at the veranda of
the school building where a program was going on when the message of the Chief
of Police was conveyed to him by patrolman Tuscano.  He made the entry on the presence of Stacy, the Chief of Police
who was the one questioning Stacy, desk sergeant Bernardo Farinas, Conrado
Rodrigo and Simeon Castro (Tsn, June 29, 1972, p. 175; September 14, 1972, p.
31).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the corroboration of documentary evidence by physi­cal
evidence:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The kind of weapon issued to Stacy on that day according to
Farinas was a 38-caliber revolver Webley (tsn., <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">Sept. 14, </span>1972), which was corroborated by testimony of Rodrigo
Sales that they were only using 38 Caliber Webley (Tsn, June 29, 1972, p.
168).  The affidavit executed by the PC
investigator <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">showed that Wilson Stacy
surrendered to him on November 25, 1965 a 38 caliber revolver, Serial No.
E-1548 and four empty shells (Crim. Case Record, p. 81).  This corroborates the findings of Dr.
Nolasco that the bullets that inflicted wounds upon the body of Rodrigo Sabado
came from a 38 caliber gun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the negative results of appellant's paraffin test:</p>

<p class="BODY">The report of the NBI dated January 3, 1966 on the results of the
paraffin test conducted in the presence of the PC investigator, Sgt. Silvestre
G. Pagawisan, by its Forensic Chemistry Division, on the persons of all the
accused including the deceased Wilson Stacy and Conrado Rodrigo, gave a negative
report on the presence of nitrate on the hands of Stacy, Sales, Rodrigo, and
Castro but gave positive results for nitrates on both hands of accused
Cresencio Siazon (Crim. Case Record, p. 129).  There is no record that the investigator or the prosecution ever
disputed or disproved the NBI findings.  Neither was a ballistic test conducted to determine which gun fired the
slugs recovered from the body of the victim, considering that the same type of
guns were issued to all the accused on the day of the incident.  The Gattaran police department used only .38
caliber guns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is evident that the trial court erred in giving
credence to the very testimonies it has rejected as conflicting and unreliable
in convicting appellant and in holding that the latter's denial was not
corroborated by evidence.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the doubt engendered in its mind by the "vacil­lating
and doubtful" testimony of prosecution witness Felix Caranza and its
characterization of the testimony of witness Rolando dela Cruz Mangupag as
susceptible of two explanations:  one
favorable to the accused and the other, against him, which is not sufficient to
support conviction, the trial court nevertheless surmised that "it is not
unlikely that Simeon Castro aided his brother policeman (Wilson Stacy) by
shooting the deceased Rodrigo Sabado." Finding a defendant guilty in a
criminal case cannot rest on a mere presumption, but upon clear proof of guilt
beyond reasonable doubt (Ilo vs. Court of Appeals, 108 Phil. 938 /1960/).  In People vs. Dramayo (42 SCRA 59 /1971/),
this court held:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Accusation is not, according to the funda­mental law,
synonymous with guilt.  It is incum­bent
on the prosecution to demonstrate that culpability lies.  Appellants were not even called upon then to
offer evidence on their behalf.  Their
freedom is forfeit only if the requisite quantum of proof necessary for convic­tion
be in existence.  Their guilt must be
shown beyond reasonable doubt.  To such
a standard, this Court has always been committed.  There is need, therefore, for the most careful scrutiny of the
testimony of the state, both oral and documentary, independently of whatever
defense is offered by the accused.  Only
if the judge below and the appellate tribunal could arrive at a conclusion that
the crime had been committed precisely by the person on trial under such an
exacting test should the sentence be one of conviction.  It is thus required that every circumstance
favoring his innocence be duly taken into account.  The proof against him must survive the test of reason; the
strongest suspicion must not be permitted to sway judgment.  x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Convictions must come only after it survives the test of
reason.  (People v. Bania, 134 SCRA 347
/1985/).  Where the prosecutor's
evidence has many loose ends, and has failed to tie up to the satisfaction of
the court so that the guilt of the accused has not been established beyond
reasonable doubt the accused is entitled to acquittal (People v. Tempongko,
Jr., 144 SCRA 483 /1986/).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the alternative, in order to implicate accused-appellant and
hold him responsible for the death of Sabado, conspi­racy must be shown to
exist, for when there is conspiracy among the accused, the actual role played
by each of them will not have to be differentiated or segregated from the acts
performed by the other accused (People v. Pamilgan, 102 SCRA 578 /1981/).  The records however, do not show that
conspiracy has been proven <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span>the
case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment of conviction is hereby
Reversed and Set Aside and the accused-appellant Simeon Castro is Acquitted on
grounds of reasonable doubt.</p>
