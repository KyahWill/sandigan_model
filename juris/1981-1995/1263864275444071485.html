petitioners filed a complaint for Ownership and Damages against herein
respondents in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
13th Judicial District, Br. V, docketed as Civil Case No. 758-CC, alleging that
they are co-owners of a certain parcel of agricultural land (subject of the
auction sale) which they inherited from their deceased father, Pedro Galicia,

<p class="BODY">The complaint further alleged that pursuant to Civil Case No. 56
(forcible entry case), respondents were able to take possession of the land in
question as said case was heard ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>; and that a
decision was rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>respondents’
favor and said decision was executed sometime in 1976 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 36-37).</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Answer, respondents (defendants below) countered that
they were able to take possession of the land described in the complaint by
virtue of the decision and later, execution of the decision in the forcible
entry case, which, by petitioners' (plaintiffs below) averment in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">their </span>complaint is an admission of an

respondent judge Hon. <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> M. Polo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the pre-trial, counsel for private
respondents moved for time within which to file a motion for summary judgment

<p class="BODY">Defendants’ (private respondents herein) motion for summary
judgment was filed on July 7, 1978 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 43)
alleging that no genuine issue exists in the case at bar after the pre-trial
was conducted and admission of facts were had (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 44), while plaintiffs (petitioners herein) filed their opposition to the
motion for summary judgment dated July 17, 1978 alleging among others, that
genuine issues exist (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 45-47).</p>

judgment dismissing petitioners' complaint (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
48-53), the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

land in dispute is that parcel described in paragraph 3 of the complaint, a
portion of which was a subject in a forcible entry case before the Municipal
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Almagro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>

until the possession of said portion was transferred to the defendants when the
decision in that forcible entry case was executed in 1976 (Exhibit 7) such
being the case, therefore with respect to this portion of the land in dispute,
the possession is settled, which would constitute as a bar to this action. </blockquote>

a sale executed by the sheriff; the one year period having elapsed without
exercising their right of redemption, as a result a final deed of sale was
issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legality of the sale not

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue in this case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Case No. 758-CC by summary judgment.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of petitioners that the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court </span>erred in deciding their
complaint (CC No. 758-CC) by summary judgment when there are several genuine
issues involved therein which require a full trial on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among other things, petitioners contend that
the execution sale conducted by the Deputy Provincial Sheriff was null and void
and would have merited a trial on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it is further contended that as between Civil Case No. 56 and
Civil Case No. 758-CC, there can be no <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">res</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>, </span>considering that
there is no identity of parties, cause of action and subject matter between the
two actions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>After a thorough review of
the records, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the summary judgment
rendered by respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Rules of Court authorizes the rendition of summary judgment
if the pleadings, depositions and admissions on file together with the
affidavits, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no issue as
to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law (Sec. 3, Rule 34).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, summary judgment is not proper where the pleadings tender
vital issues the resolution of which call for the presentation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>evidence (<span class="SpellE">Villanuva</span>
v. NAMARCO, 28 SCRA 729<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>[1969]; <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, et al., v. CA, et al., 124 SCRA 297 [1983]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Summary judgment "is a device for weeding out sham claims or
defenses at an early stage of the litigation, thereby avoiding the expense and
loss of time involved in a trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
very object is ‘to separate what is formal or pretended in denial or averment
from what is genuine and substantial, so that only the latter may subject a
suitor to the burden of trial.’ The test, therefore, of a motion for summary
judgment is – whether the pleadings, affidavits, and exhibits in support of the
motion are sufficient to overcome the opposing papers and to justify a finding
as a matter of law that there is no defense to the action or the claim is
clearly meritorious" (Estrada v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>,
et al., 71 SCRA 523 [1976]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, summary judgment is one of the methods sanctioned in
the present Rules of Court for a prompt disposition of civil actions wherein
there exists no serious controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
procedure may be availed of not only by claimants, but also by defending
parties who may be the object of unfounded claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for summary judgment assumes that
scrutinizing the facts will disclose that the issues presented by the pleadings
need not be tried because they are so patently unsubstantial as not to be
genuine issues, or that there is no genuine issue as to any material facts or
where the facts appear undisputed and certain from the pleadings, depositions,
admissions and affidavits (Singleton v. Philippine Trust Co., 99 Phil. 91
[1956], cited in <span class="SpellE">Bayang</span> v. CA, 148 SCRA 91 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Examining petitioners’
complaint, the Court finds that the disputed property is the same parcel of
land, which adjoins private respondents' lot which was the subject of the
forcible entry case and from which petitioners were </span>ordered to
vacate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When petitioners (then
defendants), failed to satisfy the rentals adjudged in the forcible <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">entry </span>case, said adjoining parcel of
land was sold at public auction to Juan <span class="SpellE">Palajos</span>

</span>Having failed to redeem the property sold at the public auction sale

(Sec. 30, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court), petitioners cannot now claim that
