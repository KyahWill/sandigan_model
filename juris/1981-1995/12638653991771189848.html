<div class="Section2">

<p class="BODY">Applying the interpretation of the Director of the Bureau of
Labor Standards, the Regional Director considered the complainants (private
respondents herein) as falling under Group IV because their restdays (Saturdays
and Sundays) are not regarded payable and are therefore governed by the
principle of "no work, no pay".</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on these findings, an order was issued by <span style="">the </span>Regional Director dismissing the
complaints, the dispositive <span style="">portion </span>of
which reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, all the foregoing premises considered, the
complaints for <span style="">differential pay </span>for
13th month bonus pursuant to PD 851, the differential pay <span style="">in </span>the Cost of Living Allowance and the
underpayment of wages are hereby dismissed for lack <span style="">of </span>merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consequently, the complaint for vacation and sick leave of
Eva Cayetano is likewise dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no law which grants vacation and sick leave with pay to
employees in the private sector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these
employees enjoy the said benefits, it is because of a collective bargaining
agreement or by virtue of management's generosity or policy, either of which
does not obtain in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The complaint of Conchita Mercado for overtime pay is also
dismissed for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Rollo, pp. 33-34).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents Conchita Mercado, Necitas Gacis, Evelyn B.
Garais, Estrella Gaton, Eva Cayetano, Teresa G. Bilazon, Susan G. Fuellas,
Elvina D. Gacis, Lourdes Correa, Julieta A. Manalo, Nila <span style="">G. </span>Gabelo and Teodoro Guanizo appealed
to the Secretary of Labor and Employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On February 2, 1984, the Undersecretary (then Deputy Minister of Labor
and Employment) reversed the order of the Regional Director and required the
petitioner Osias Academy to pay the private respondents monetary benefits as
stated in its order, on the basis of his conclusion that complainants' claim
for underpayment, cost of living allowances, 13th month pay and incentive leave
pay do not appear satisfied in petitioner Academy's own payroll.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among others, the Undersecretary (then Deputy
Minister of Labor and Employment) found that complainants do not belong to the
Group IV category or daily paid employees but are monthly employees receiving
their pay every "quincena", thus they are entitled to the statutory
benefits accorded monthly employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, there is no showing that complainants' allowances under P.D.
525 and 1123 were integrated to their basic salaries in compliance with P.D.
1751.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Deputy Minister ruled that complainants were
underpaid and therefore, must be paid salary differentials (Rollo, pp. 22-25,
Annex "A" of the Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners then filed a motion for reconsideration of the
aforementioned Order of the Deputy Minister on <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="2">February 29, 1984</st1:date> which was denied on <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1985</st1:date> (Rollo, p. 40 and p. 26,
respectively).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On second motion for
reconsideration (Rollo, pp. 58-77), the same was likewise denied in an Order
dated <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1988</st1:date>
(Rollo, p. 27).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with Preliminary
Injunction and Urgent Prayer for Restraining Order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1988</st1:date>,
private respondents filed a "Motion for Execution" of the appealed
order of the Department of Labor and Employment but the Regional Office No. V
of the Department of Labor refused to act on the motion on the ground that <st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Osias</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and Monica de Castro filed this instant petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner had allegedly filed an
unverified "Motion to Stay Execution" before the Office of the
Secretary of Labor on May 23, 1988 but this was dismissed for lack <span style="">of </span>jurisdiction <span style="">in </span>an Order
dated <span style="">July</span><span style=""> 11, 1988, hence, </span>private respondents
prayed that <span style="">this </span>Court <span style="">take </span>judicial notice of the said order
(Rollo, pp, 95-96).</p>

<p class="BODY">After a brief exchange of pleadings by the parties, the Second <span style="">Division </span>of this Court, in a
resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1989</st1:date>
gave due course to the petition and required the parties to submit simultaneous
memoranda (Rollo, p. 160).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in their memorandum alleged <span style="">that </span>respondent Department of Labor and Employment acted with
grave abuse of discretion amounting <span style="">to </span>lack
of <span style="">jurisdiction in </span>issuing the
disputed order of February 2, 1984 awarding salary and allowance differentials,
service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay to private respondents
considering that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) private
respondentsâ prayer on appeal was only for the issuance of an order to require
the labor arbiter to conduct a <span style="">hearing;
(b) petitioner </span>had earlier fully <span style="">satisfied
an </span>order of the Labor Regulation <span style="">Officers
on </span>the letter-complaint of the same private respondents on the same
subject matter and cause of action; (c) the disputed order awarded wage and
ECOLA differentials contrary to law and the facts; (d) the disputed order
awarded incentive leave pay when such award was not prayed for in the complaint
and awarded 13th month pay differentials without basis and contrary <span style="">to </span>the evidence on record; and (e) the
<span style="">disputed </span>order improperly
considered petitioner Monica de Castro as respondent when she was not <span style="">even </span>named in the complaint subject
matter of the disputed order (Rollo, p. 168).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well established is the principle that findings of administrative
agencies which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined
to specific matters are generally accorded not only respect but even
finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial review by this Court
on labor cases do not go so far as to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence
upon which the Deputy Minister and the Regional Director based their
determinations but are limited to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of
discretion (Needle Queen Corporation v. Nicolas, et al., G.R. Nos. 60741-43,
December 22, 1989; Baby Bus Inc. v. Ministry of Labor, 158 SCRA 221 [1988];
Philippine Overseas Drilling and Oil Dev. Corp. v. Ministry of Labor, 146 SCRA
79 [1986]; Rosario Bros. Inc. v. Ople, 131 SCRA 72 [1984]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <i>certiorari</i> to lie, there must be
capricious, arbitrary and whimsical exercise of power, the very antithesis of
the judicial prerogative in accordance with centuries of both civil and common
law traditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The abuse of discretion
must be grave and patent and it must be shown that the discretion was exercised
arbitrarily or despotically (Purefoods Corp. v. NLRC, 171 SCRA 415 [1989];
Buiser v. Leogardo, Jr., 131 SCRA 151 [1984]), which is not obtaining in the
present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that petitioners have accepted the jurisdiction
of the Regional Director by presenting their evidence and asking affirmative
relief without challenging his power to hear and try the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As can be gleaned from the records, this case <span style="">could have been settled and disposed of easily
if all </span>concerned <span style="">had </span>followed
the proper <span style="">procedures <span style="">in </span></span>labor cases <span style="">and </span>all <span style="">evidence </span>and documents presented to
the barest requirements of truth <span style="">and </span>fair play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the submission of this case to the
arbitration branch as sought by respondent complainants could have settled the
case more expeditiously and wisely, but it was <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place> which opposed the
arbitration on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents' memorandum of appeal explicitly prayed for
"such other <span style="">remedies </span>and
benefits as may be proper under the premises." Such general prayer
included the relief granted in the disputed order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the award of Service Incentive
Leave pay <span style="">is </span>a statutory benefit
which cannot be denied to private respondents (See Article 95, <span style="">Labor </span>Code), the same is true with
respect to the 13th month pay since P.D. 851 states that <span style="">"all employers
are </span>required to pay all their employees receiving a basic salary of not
more than P1,000.00 a month, regardless of the nature of their employment, a
13th month pay not later than December 24 of every year [See Sec. 1, P.D. 851;
Dentech Mfg. Corp. v. NLRC, 172 SCRA 588 [1989]) and so all the complainants
who <span style="">were </span>not paid their 13th
month pay <span style="">must
be </span><span style="">paid accordingly. And </span>this
is what the Deputy Minister of Labor did when he ordered the award of 13th
month pay and the SIL pay.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention that its full satisfaction of private
respondents' letter?complaint <span style="">for </span>underpayment/nonpayment
of wages, allowances and 13th month pay by virtue of <span style="">an </span>order of the labor regulation officers, constituted <u><span style="">res</span></u><span style=""> <u>judicata</u> </span>is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Minister of Labor in
exercising his appellate jurisdiction over the order of the Regional Director
found that the restitution payroll was deficient and did not include the claims
for underpayment and 13th month pay of private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such appellate jurisdiction includes the
power to review the entire records <span style="">of </span>the
case and if the Secretary of Labor finds that the appealed judgment is
erroneous or deficient, it may correct said judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>regards the
