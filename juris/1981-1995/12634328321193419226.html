				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The subject of controversy in these two consolidated petitions is
a parcel of land - <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 671-A<span style=""> </span>of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate located in Barrio
<span class="SpellE">Culiat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are individual lot owners who claim to have
bought their respective portions from <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> in the 1950's.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
is alleged to be the registered owner of said land evidenced by Transfer of
Certificate Title No. 16212 covering about 81,160 square meters who converted
it into a subdivision known as <span class="SpellE">Clemville</span> Subdivision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lot 671-A is actually part of a bigger parcel known as Lot 671
which is claimed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> (INK), which bought said
property from Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz in 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Cruz was
adjudged the rightful owner of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 671 in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">dela</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>Cruz</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>dela</u></span> <u>Cruz</u> (130 SCRA 666 [1984]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INK began fencing the whole area and placed
the following sign "NO TRESPASSING - IGLESIA NI KRISTO PROPERTY SUPREME
COURT CASE NO. 61969, <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1984</st1:date>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Briefly, the <span class="SpellE"><u>dela</u></span> <u>Cruz</u> <u>v</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">dela</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>Cruz</u> case is an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> founded on breach of trust filed by <span class="SpellE">Augustina</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, et al.
against Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and INK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Augustina</span> and her
co-plaintiffs charged that the parcel of land purchased by the INK from Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz was actually a part of their inheritance share in
the estate of their late grandfather, <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz but which, in breach of trust known to the INK,
Lucia sold to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Augustina's</span> suit was originally decided
in her favor by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment was reversed and the questioned
sale by Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz to the INK was upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Augustina</span>
went to the Supreme Court on a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>,
docketed as G. R. No. <span style="">61969.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1984</st1:date>,
the Court rendered a decision in G. R. No. 61969 affirming the decision of the
Court of <span style="">Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The validity of the sale of Lucia to
the INK <span style="">was </span>thereby upheld and
the title of INK to the subject realty - (<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 671) was
validated as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Supreme Court decision spawned the two (2) petitions <span style="">now</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span>before
us assailing the validity of Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz's title
over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 671 which <span style="">in</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span>turn was sold to INK.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>G.R.</u> <u><span style="">No.</span></u><span style=""> <u>76265</u>, </span>petitioner Virginia <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span> alleged that she is the registered owner of a
portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 671-A (subdivision plan - PSD 32221) as
evidenced by TCT Nos. 17566, 17564 and 17562.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She allegedly came to know of <span class="SpellE">INK's</span> claim only
when a prospective buyer inspected the <span style="">liana
on </span>August 1986 and saw <span style="">the
"no </span>trespassing" sign.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span> lost no time <span style="">in inquiring </span>into the status of the
land and learned about the pending <span class="SpellE">consulta</span> case (LRC
1978) filed before the Administrator of the National Land Titles and Deeds
Registration Administration (NLTDRA).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <span class="SpellE">consulta</span> came about when the Register of
Deeds doubted the <span class="SpellE">registrability</span> of the documents
presented before it in the light of his findings that the land affected was
covered by two (2) sets of titles issued in the names of different owners.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1986</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed a Motion to Intervene requesting the Administrator to
conduct an investigation of the supposed anomaly committed in connection with
the reconstitution of TCT No. <span class="GramE">RT-58 in the name of Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was denied by the Administrator invoking our ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">dela</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>Cruz</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>dela</u></span> <u>Cruz</u> to the effect that TCT RT-58 in the
name of respondent Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz is the valid
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 44-47)</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, a Motion for Reconsideration was filed by herein
petitioner but this was likewise denied by the Administrator on October 20,
1986 on the ground that the issues raised therein have already been passed upon
and that the issues being litigious <span style="">in </span>nature
can not be decided in a <span class="SpellE">consulta</span> case "where the
only question to be determined is the <span class="SpellE">registrability</span>
of the document presented for registration."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, on <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="10">October 27,
 1986</st1:date>, the petitioner filed the instant Special Civil Action for <i>Certiorari</i>
and Prohibition in G.R. No. 76265 against the Administrator of the NLTDRA, the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and private
respondents Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Simangan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">ni</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and
<span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Simangan</span> were <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as they were predecessors-in-interest of INK.</p>

<p class="BODY">INK and the Administrator filed their comments on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1987</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1987</st1:date> respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For failure to locate <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Simangan's</span> whereabouts despite diligent efforts and
considering further that INK is the indispensable party and the one interested
in upholding the validity of the reconstituted title of respondent Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, the petitioner moved to drop him as
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was granted by the
Court in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="4">April 13,
 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 189)</p>

<p class="BODY">Taking the cue from the Administrator that present certificates
of title must be cancelled to avoid duplication, the Register of Deeds, instead
of filing its comment initiated cancellation proceedings of more than 100
titles against 81 defendants which included herein petitioner on the basis of
this Court's declaration in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>dela</u></span> <u>Cruz</u>
<u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">dela</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>Cruz</u> that the reconstituted
title of respondent Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz is the valid
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was filed by the
Office of the Solicitor-General (OSG) on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="1">January
 5, 1987</st1:date> with the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-49900.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the petitioner moved to dismiss on the ground that
the complaint was premature and maliciously filed with knowledge of the instant
petition with this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INK, on the
other hand filed a Motion to <span class="GramE">Intervene</span> in said
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claiming ownership over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
671, it prayed for damages against some of the defendants namely <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> de Leon, Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Panlilio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Pineda who filed an injunction suit against it (Civil
Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-45767) with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span><span class="GramE"> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 12, 1985</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite opposition of the petitioner to respondent <span class="SpellE">INK's</span> Motion to Intervene, presiding Judge <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Dayaw</span> granted the
motion of INK and denied petitioner's Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the
issues raised in the instant petition (G. R. No. 76265) will not substantially
affect said civil case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent
motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner was likewise denied
considering that no restraining order has been issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
198-216)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">However, instead <span style="">of </span>filing an answer to the complaint in Civil Case No.</span>
Q-49900, the petitioners filed on <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1988</st1:date> a supplemental petition before this Court to include as
additional respondent, the Honorable Judge <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> T.
<span class="SpellE">Dayaw</span> and petitioner's children who were named as
defendants in said Civil Case, as additional petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time the petitioner prayed for a
restraining order (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 197).</p>

<p class="BODY">To <span style="">this </span>supplemental
petition, the OSG in behalf of the Republic filed its comment pursuant to the
Court's resolution granting the petitioner's motion for leave to include
additional parties and to admit supplemental petition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 228).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, fire gutted the records of the Register of Deeds
in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>
so respondent Judge required the parties to agree to a stipulation of facts
instead of trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In <u>G.R.</u> <u>No.</u> <u>83280</u>,
the petitioners alleged that they and/or their predecessors in interest were
issued their corresponding titles to the lots purchased from <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> in the 1950's
yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">They alleged that they took physical possession of their lots in <span class="SpellE">Clemville</span> Subdivision by actually occupying the same,
declaring them in their names for tax purposes, fencing or marking them off and
entrusting their care to "<span class="SpellE">katiwalas</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the time they acquired their Torrens
Title they and they alone to the exclusion of INK exercised all acts of
undisturbed, peaceful and uninterrupted ownership and possession including the
payment of their realty taxes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about the second week of August, 1985, INK started to
enclose the entire <span class="SpellE">Clemville</span> Subdivision with "<span class="SpellE">sawali</span>" fences with billboards randomly posted which
read:</p>

<p class="BODY">INK also destroyed the concrete/hollow block fence surrounding
the lot of petitioner de Castro and started the construction of housing
structures therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, it
commenced the delivery of construction materials to the former premises of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Panlilio</span> <span style="">to </span>erect a permanent structure of strong materials on it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1985</st1:date>,
the petitioners <span style="">filed</span> with the
RTC-Branch 101 a petition for injunction with <span style="">damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case was docketed

<span class="SpellE">Manalo</span></span> volunteering to maintain the <span style="">status quo </span>until<span style=""> then or until the </span>matter had been
resolved by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 19, by agreement of the <span style="">parties and</span> in open court, the Judge issued an order granting
the parties’ motion to enter into a stipulation of facts instead of going on
with the hearing and to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the exchange of pleadings between the parties,
the trial judge issued an Order on December 6, 1985 denying the petitioners'
prayer for the issuance o<span style="">f a writ of
preliminary injunction on the grounds that:</span></p>

<blockquote>"From the exchange of written arguments and the authorities
cited, it appears that the petitioners' titles which were issued some ten years

<p class="BODY">Assailing this order, the petitioners by way of <i>certiorari</i>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1986</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition with the following assignment of

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="8">August
 30, 1989</st1:date>, G. R. No. 83280 was consolidated with G.R. No. 76265.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although other minor issues are involved in these consolidated cases,
the principal and crucial issue that alone needs to be resolved is the
applicability of this Court's decision in the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">dela</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>Cruz</u></span><span style=""> </span>case
to these cases now before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners argue that the <span class="SpellE"><u>dela</u></span>
<u>Cruz</u> case could not be applied to them since they were not parties in
that case <span class="GramE">nor</span> were they ever notified of such case
pending between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners explained that the <u>de</u> <u><span style="">la</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Cruz</u>
case was a case among the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> de la
Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since they acquired their
properties from an entirely different person, <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> and not from any of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> de la Cruz, they could not be considered privies
to any of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In denying applicability, however, the petitioners assail the
Court's ruling that "the reconstituted title of Lucia de la Cruz over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
671 (TCT No. RT 58) was valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the

for value in good faith holds the same free from all encumbrances except those
noted in said certificate."</p>

<p class="BODY">With this Court's ruling promulgated in 1984, it is our
considered view that the petitioners can not raise anew the question of
ownership of Lucia de la Cruz over Lot 671 which had been determined by the
Court of Appeals and affirmed by the Supreme Court in the <u>de</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the rule
enunciated in <u>Church</u> <u>Assistance</u> <u>Program,</u> <u>Inc</u>. <u>v</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Sibulo</u></span>, 171 SCRA 408 [1989] that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"When
a </span>right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, so long as <span style="">it </span>remains
<span class="SpellE">unreversed</span>, it should be conclusive upon the parties
and those in <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with them in law or
estate."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court's ruling has long been final and the issue on ownership
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 671 finally disposed of several years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This declaration must be respected and
followed in the instant case applying the principle of <span class="SpellE">res</span>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span> or, otherwise, the rule on <span style="">conclusiveness of judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The less familiar concept or less
terminological usage of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>
as a rule on conclusiveness of judgment refers to the situation where the
judgment in the prior action operates as an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
only as to the matters actually determined therein or which were necessarily
included therein (De la Cruz v. Court of Appeals, 187 SCRA 165 [1990]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Inevitably, the <span class="SpellE"><u>dela</u></span> <u>Cruz</u>

[1990]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the petitioners
substantially adopt the same findings of facts in their pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factual inquiry with regards to the

Court is not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the present petition is not the
proper remedy in challenging the validity of certificates of titles since the
judicial action required is a direct and not a collateral attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
Realty Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Vallez</span>, 173 SCRA 534 [1989]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>"We note with approval the lower court's patient explanation
that, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, the certificate of title issued in
the name of the plaintiff in accordance with the Land Registration Act (Act No.
496) is indefeasible after the expiration of one year from the entry of the
decree of registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 38
thereof, a petition for review of the decree must be presented within one year
after its entry as described and defined in Section 40 of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the lapse of one year, the decree of
registration becomes incontrovertible and is binding upon and conclusive
against all persons whether or not they were notified of or participated in the
registration proceedings. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Even assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that said
titles may still be <span class="GramE">challenged,</span> the present case does
not provide the vehicle for that remedy since the judicial action required is a
direct, and not a collateral attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, under the existing law, Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree
expressly provides that a certificate of title cannot be subject to collateral
attack and can be altered, modified or cancelled only in a direct proceeding in
accordance with law." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 542)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In our capacity as the court of last resort, the petitioners try
to convince us to look or inquire into the validity of the reconstitution
proceedings initiated by Lucia <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, contending
that the implementation of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">dela</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>Cruz</u>
ruling would deprive them of their properties without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have looked long and hard into the records
of the case but the facts and circumstances plus law and jurisprudence on the
matter do not warrant such action from the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">INK's</span> title over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
671 which necessarily included <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 671-A had already
become incontrovertible and indefeasible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To reopen or to question the legality of <span class="SpellE">INK's</span>
title would defeat the purpose of our <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system
which seeks to insure stability by quieting titled lands and putting to a stop
forever any question of the legality of the registration in the certificate or
questions which may arise <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">de</span> la Cruz v. <span style="">de la Cruz, <u>sup</u></span><u><span style="">ra</span></u><span style="">.) </span><span style="">In fairness to INK,
as registered owner it is entitled to rest secure in its land title.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of all the foregoing, it would be for the public interest
and the maintenance of the integrity and stability of the Torrens system of
land registration that all transfer certificates of title derived from the
reconstituted title of Eugenia de la Paz and <span class="SpellE">Dorotea</span>
de la Cruz be annulled in order to prevent the proliferation of derivative
titles which are null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
legality or validity of <span class="SpellE">INK's</span> title over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
671 has been settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has
spoken and it has done so with finality, logically and rightly so as to assure
stability in legal relations and avoid confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">see</span> <span class="SpellE">Ver</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Quetulio</span>, 163 SCRA 80
