				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The principal question in the proceedings at bar is whether or
not an action of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> filed in the
Municipal Trial Court against a lessee -- grounded on the expiration of the
latter's lease -- ­should be abated or suspended by an action filed in the
Regional Trial Court by the defendant lessee -- on the claim that he is
entitled to a right of preemption (or prior purchase) of the premises in
question and wishes to have said right judicially enforced.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question arises from facts not disputed and now briefly
narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Wilmon</span> Auto Supply Corporation (or
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Que</span>), Iloilo Multi Parts Supply Corporation (or
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Que</span>), <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, Henry Tan, Southern Sales Corporation, and Chang <span class="SpellE">Liang</span>, Jr. were lessees of a commercial building and bodegas
standing on registered land in Iloilo City owned in common by Lucy A. <span class="SpellE">Solinap</span>, Fr. Jerry R. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>,
Lourdes C. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, Manuel C. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>
and Ester L. <span class="SpellE">Jarantilla</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The leases were embodied in uniformly worded deeds executed by the individual
petitioners, as lessees, and Lourdes C. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>,
representing the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>-co-owners.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The lease contracts, among others -</p>

<p class="BODY">1. stipulated fixed terms or periods (September 1, 1987 to August
30, 1989);</p>

<p class="BODY">2. provided for a deposit of an amount equal to two months’
rents;</p>

<p class="BODY">3. provided that the lessee should give the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
30 days prior notice of the intention to terminate or renew the contract, and
that if no such written notice were given, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
would consider the contract terminated on the expiration of the term; and</p>

<p class="BODY">4. contained a “reservation of rights” reading as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote><i>“Reservation of rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>LESSOR reserves the rights
to sell, mortgage, hypothecate or encumber the property so long as it requires
the purchase(r) or mortgage creditors to respect the terms of this lease contract;
provided further that LESSEE shall be duly informed about <span class="SpellE">LESSOR's</span>
plan to sell the property.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 18, 1989, after the expiration of the period fixed
in the lease agreements, the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> executed a
public instrument entitled “Deed of Absolute Sale”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in virtue of which they sold the leased property to Star Group Resources and
Development Inc. (hereafter, simply referred to as Star Group).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed provided <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span> </i>that the “Vendee shall henceforth deal with the
lessees and occupants of the properties herein sold without any further
warranty or obligation on the part of the Vendors.”</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 22, 1989, the buyer, Star Group, brought separate
actions of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> in the Municipal Trial
Court In Cities of Iloilo City against the lessees, which were docketed as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) that filed against <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Civil Case
No. 227 (89)</i>, assigned to Branch 3;</p>

<p class="BODY">2) that instituted against Chang <span class="SpellE">Liang</span>,
Jr.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Civil Case No. 230 (89), </i>raffled
to Branch 2;</p>

<p class="BODY">3) that filed against Henry Tan and Southern Sales
Corporation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Civil Case No. 232 (89)</i>,
assigned to Branch 2;</p>

<p class="BODY">4) that filed against Ramon <span class="SpellE">Que</span> “(for
the premises occupied by WILMON AUTO SUPPLY CORPORATION):” <i>Civil Case No.
233, </i>assigned to Branch 2; and</p>

<p class="BODY">5) that commenced against Ramon <span class="SpellE">Que</span>
“(for the premises occupied by ILOILO MULTI PARTS SUPPLY CORPORATION):” <i>Civil
Case No. 234</i>, raffled to Branch 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lessees refused to concede, and indeed impugned, Star Group's
right to eject them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argued that in
so selling the properties and seeking their <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> --
and their buyer -- had violated their leasehold rights because (a) they (the
lessees) were not accorded the right of preemption, (b) the buyer was not
required to honor the leases, and (c) the lessees were denied the option to renew
their leases upon the expiration thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">These propositions they set forth in their answers with
counterclaims in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> actions
against them in the Municipal Trial Courts (Branches 2 and 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">The same propositions were also set out as causes of action in a
complaint filed on December 1, 1989 by some of them -- <span class="SpellE">Wilmon</span>,
Iloilo Multi Parts, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
(doing business under the name and style of “Iloilo <span class="SpellE">Rightway</span>
Marketing”), Southern Sales and Chang <span class="SpellE">Liang</span>, Jr.
(doing business under the name and style of “Iloilo Bright Construction
Supply”)<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
-- in the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Impleaded</span> as defendants in the complaint were
the Star Group Resources and Development, Inc. and its President, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sio</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sio</span> Soy <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>, and the co-owners-vendors, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lucy A. <span class="SpellE">Solinap</span>,
Lourdes C. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, Manuel C. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>,
Ester <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> <span class="SpellE">Jarantila</span>, and
Fr. Jerry R. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, the latter as Administrator of
the Estate of the deceased Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The action thus commenced was docketed as <i>Civil Case No. 18931 </i>and
raffled to Branch 28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
complaint, the plaintiffs-lessees prayed chiefly that -</p>

<blockquote>1) the sale of the buildings, bodegas and the land on which they
stand be declared null and void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2) they be allowed to exercise their right of pre-emption or
redemption, and to recover their two-month deposits;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3) the titles to the properties be conveyed to them;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4) they be paid by the defendants jointly and severally moral
damages in the sum of 1.5 million pesos, exemplary damages in the amount of
P10,000.00, and attorney's fees in the sum of P200,000.00.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> actions,
position papers were required by the courts and submitted by the parties on the
issue of whether or not the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> actions
should be covered by the rules of summary procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts ruled that Cases Numbered <i>227</i>
(against <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>), <i>230</i>
(against Chang <span class="SpellE">Liang</span>, Jr.) and <i>234</i> (against
Iloilo Multi Parts Supply Corporation), must be so tried, but not Civil Cases
Numbered <i>232</i> (against Henry Tan and Southern Sales Corporation) and <i>233</i>
(against <span class="SpellE">Wilmon</span> Auto Supply Corporation), as to which
the summary procedure rules were inapplicable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lessees moved for reconsideration of the order and additionally
prayed for dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits on the
grounds of <span class="SpellE"><i>litis</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i>pendentia</i></span>
(adverting no doubt to Civil Case No. 18931 instituted by them in the RTC) and
lack of jurisdiction over the nature of the actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their pleas were denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon three of the lessees -- Ramon <span class="SpellE">Que</span>,
Southern Sales Corporation, and Henry T. Tan -- quite precipitately and
improperly, filed petitions for <i>certiorari </i>with this Court for the
annulment and setting aside of the orders of the Municipal Trial Court (Branch
2), which were docketed as <i>G.R.</i> <i>Nos. 94855 and 94856.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Another lessee, Antonio Chua also
instituted a similar action of <i>certiorari </i>in this Court, docketed as <i>G.R.
No. 95371.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>Predictably, this Court refused to take cognizance of their petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G.R. No. 95371 was referred to the Court of
Appeals by Resolution of the Second Division dated October 15, 1990 “for proper
determination and disposition" that Court's jurisdiction being concurrent
with this Court's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G.R. Nos. 94855 and
94856 were referred to the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
to which the lessees should have gone for relief in the first place.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the Regional Trial Court, the cases were docketed as Civil Cases Numbered
19420 (<i>Ramon</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>Que</i></span><i> v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>, etc., et al.</i>) and 19421 (<i>Southern Sales
Corporation and Henry</i> <i>T. Tan v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>,
etc., et al.).</i><i><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Judge of the Trial Court (Hon. Ricardo M. <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span>) issued a restraining order dated October 18, 1990
enjoining proceedings in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on March 11, 1991, His
Honor promulgated judgment on the merits dismissing the petitions and
dissolving the preliminary injunction of October 18, 1990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span> ruled
that the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases fall within the
jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Iloilo City, and that the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. 18931 in the RTC did not warrant
suspension of the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases, “the only
issue in the ** (the latter suits being) physical possession or possession <i>de
facto </i>while the issue involved in Civil Case No. 18931 ** is basically one
of ownership,” and it being “settled rule that the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of an action involving ownership and annulment of sale ** does not stay the
proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The lessees filed a motion for reconsideration, but this was denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span>, by Order dated April 22, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this decision of March 11, 1991, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Que</span>,
Southern Sales Corporation and Henry Tan have appealed to this Court on the
legal issue of “whether or not ** (Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span>)
erred in finding that the Municipal Trial Court in Cities did not abuse its
discretion in denying the petitioners' motion to dismiss or to hold in abeyance
the proceedings in the subject unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
cases.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 98700-01, p. 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their appeal was docketed as <i><u>G.R.</u></i><u>
<i>Nos. 98700-­01</i></u><i>.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, two (2) of the lessees, <span class="SpellE">Wilmon</span>
Auto Supply Corporation (represented by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Que</span>)
and Chang <span class="SpellE">Liang</span> -- who are among the plaintiffs in
Civil Case No. 18931 pending in Branch 28 of the Regional Trial Court, Iloilo
City -- took a different tack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
filed a motion in said Court praying for a writ of preliminary injunction to
stop the Municipal Trial Court from hearing their <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argued that the decision in
Civil Case No. 18931 would be decisive of the rights of the parties,
particularly on the question of the lessees' claimed option to renew their
leases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court however denied their motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To nullify the Trial Court's denial of their
plea for injunctive relief, they repaired to the Court of Appeals by way of a
petition for <i>certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Their
action was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 23750.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal ruled adversely to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its Decision promulgated on February 28,
1991, the Appellate Tribunal pointed out (a) that “the issues ** (the
petitioners) are raising in the Regional Trial Court are the very same issues
they, as defendants in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases, are
raising ** and (considering that “the Municipal Trial Court's jurisdiction is
not in question”) there is no reason why simply because the same issues are
raised in the action brought in the Regional Trial Court the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceedings should be suspended, and (b) that in
truth, “questions pertaining to ‘the relation between landlord and tenant, the
period or life of the lease or tenancy, the reasonableness of the rental, the
right of the tenant (to remain in occupancy) against the will of the landlord,
etc.’ are (precisely) the sort of questions which should be decided in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
From this judgment, the lessees have taken an appeal to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their appeal was docketed as <i><u>G.R.</u></i><u>

<p class="BODY">As stated in this opinion's opening paragraph, the crucial
question, at bottom, is whether or not Star Group's unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suits in the Municipal Trial Court against
petitioner lessees for the reason that their leases had expired, should be abated
by the actions filed in the Regional Trial Court by said petitioner lessees
based on the contention that they are entitled to a right of preemption or
prior purchase of the leased premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a question that is far from novel, one that has been passed upon
and resolved by this Court in numerous cases, and one to which a negative
answer has invariably been given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
relevant precedents are hereunder outlined.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. <i>Injunction suits</i> instituted in the RTC by defendants in
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> actions in the municipal trial courts or
other courts of the first level (<span class="SpellE">Nacorda</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, 17 SCRA 920 [1966]) do not abate the latter; and
neither do proceedings on <i>consignation of rentals </i>(Lim <span class="SpellE">Si</span> v. Lim, 98 Phil. 868 [1956], citing <span class="SpellE">Pue</span>,

<p class="BODY">2. An “<span class="SpellE"><i>accion</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></i>” does not suspend an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit against the plaintiff in the former (Ramirez v. <span class="SpellE">Bleza</span>,
106 SCRA 187 [1981]).</p>

<p class="BODY">3. A “<i>writ of possession case</i>”, where ownership is
concededly the principal issue before the Regional Trial Court does not
preclude nor bar the execution of the judgment in an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suit where the only issue involved is the material
possession or possession <i>de</i> <i>facto</i> of the premises (Heirs of F. <span class="SpellE">Guballa</span>, Sr. v. C.A., et al.; etc., 168 SCRA 518 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">4. An <i>action for quieting of title </i>to property is not a
bar to an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit involving the same property
(<span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span> v. de la Victoria, 46 SCRA 139 [1972]).</p>

<p class="BODY">5. <i>Suits for specific performance with damages</i> do not

<p class="BODY">6. An <i>action for reformation of instrument </i>(e.g.<i>, </i>from
deed of absolute sale to one of sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i>

<p class="BODY">The underlying reasons for the above rulings were that the
actions in the Regional Trial Court did not involve physical or <i>de facto </i>possession,
and, on not a few occasions, that the case in the Regional Trial Court was
merely a ploy to delay disposition of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceeding, or that the issues presented in the former could quite as easily be
set up as defenses in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> action and there
resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is specially true in the
cases at bar, where the petitioners-lessees’ claims --- that the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> (and the buyer of the leased premises) had violated
their leasehold rights because (a) they (the lessees) were not accorded the
right of preemption, (b) the buyer was not required to respect their leases,
and (c) the lessees were denied the option to renew their leases upon the
expiration thereof --- constituted their causes of action in the suits
commenced by them in the Regional Trial Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Leopoldo</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> v. Court of Appeals, et al., </i>G.R. No. 95818, August
2, 1991,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
for instance, the following pronouncements were made:</p>

<blockquote>“Private respondents insist that the Rule on Summary Procedure does
not apply since there is a question of ownership involved albeit in another
case pending in another court, that is, the aforesaid Civil Case No. 88-47264
in the Regional Trial Court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We apprehend that if this theory is adopted, the applicability of the
Rule on Summary Procedure in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases could
easily be thwarted by the defendant through the simple expedient of filing an
action in the regional trial court contesting the plaintiffs ownership over the
property from which defendant is sought to be evicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the obvious intimation of private
respondents that the regular procedure, and not the summary procedure, should
be followed * * does not impress us as being endowed with legal or logical
support.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“* * * * *.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Thus, the fact that the tenant had previously filed a separate
action in the former Court of First Instance involving the ownership of the
land is not a valid reason to frustrate the summary remedy of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
action filed by the tenant only lends credence to the fact that the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case filed by plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">agianst</span>
the former does not involve the question of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abragan</span>, et al., 66 SCRA 600 [1975]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because the judgment rendered in
an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case shall not bar an action between the
same parties respecting title to the land or building nor shall it be held
conclusive of the facts therein found in a case between the same parties upon a
different cause of action involving possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Ping, et al. vs. Regional Trial Court of
Manila, Branch 40, et al., 154 SCRA 77 [1987]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases the
jurisdiction of the court is determined by the allegations of the complaint,
not by the defenses raised by defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Ramirez v. Chit, 21 SCRA 1364 [1967]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“ * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
does not constitute a compelling reason to delay the termination of an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, for it gives rise merely to an expectancy
that the documents assailed therein may be nullified and the subject properties
may be ordered <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to private respondents, as
compared to the clear, actual and existing legal right of petitioner to the
possession of the subject property as the registered owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Galgala</span>, et al.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated, Inc., et al., 177 SCRA 288
[1989]).”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The precedents invoked by the petitioners<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> do
not represent current and prevailing doctrine; they might at most be deemed
exceptions justifying the general rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the facts in the rulings invoked by them are quite readily
distinguishable from the numerous precedents upholding said general rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as regards the seemingly contrary ruling in <span class="SpellE"><i>Vda</i></span><i>. de <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Avendaño</span>, </i>79 SCRA 135 (1977), this Court observed, in <i>Salinas
v. Navarro, </i>126 SCRA 167, 172-1<span style="font-size: 11pt;">7</span>3
(1983), that “the exception to the rule in this case of <span class="SpellE"><i>Vda</i></span>.
<i>de <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> </i>is based on strong reasons of
equity not found in the present petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right of the petitioners is not so seriously placed in issue in the
annulment case as to warrant a deviation, on equitable grounds, from the
imperative nature of the rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE"><i>Vda</i></span>. <i>de <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> </i>case,
execution of the decision in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case would
also have meant demolition of the premises, a factor not present in this
petition.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><i>Vda</i></span><i>. de <span class="SpellE">Murga</span>
v. Chan</i>, 25 SCRA 441 (1968) is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the essential requisite of an
unequivocal demand to vacate and surrender the premises had not been fulfilled,
as the demand actually made on the lessee was in the alternative:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>either pay rentals at an increased rate, or
if this be unacceptable, to surrender the leased property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it appeared that the defendant’s
lease had not been legitimately ended but, on the contrary, had been
automatically renewed in virtue of a special clause in the lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was for these reasons that this Court held
that the case was “outside the jurisdiction of the municipal court * *.”<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is <span class="SpellE"><i>Valderrama</i></span><i> Lumber
Manufacturer's Co., Inc. v. L.S. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> Co</i>., 5
SCRA 287 (1962), also relied upon by the petitioners, in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
complaint was also found to be fatally defective in that it failed to allege
that the plaintiff had been in prior possession of the premises in question, or
had been deprived thereof by any of the means set forth in Section 1, Rule 72
of the Rules of Court or that possession was being unlawfully withheld from
said plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts in <span class="SpellE"><i>Quiambao</i></span><i> v.
Osorio, </i>158 SCRA 674 (1988) are also quite peculiar and differ from those
in the cases at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><i>Quiambao</i></span><i>
v. Osorio </i>originated from a complaint for forcible entry filed against <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Municipal
Court by persons claiming to be legitimate possessors of a 30,835-square-meter
lot by virtue of Agreement to Sell No. 3482 executed in their favor by the
former Land Tenure Administration (later, the Land Authority, then the Department
of Agrarian Reform).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>
moved to dismiss the action, alleging that that agreement had been impugned in
an administrative case before the Land Authority and said case constituted a
“prejudicial question.” The motion was denied, and <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>
instituted a special civil action of <i>certiorari </i>in the Court of First
Instance to nullify the order of denial and cause dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this <i>certiorari </i>suit, the Land Authority, by leave of court, intervened
“praying that the petition for <i>certiorari </i>be granted and ** (it, the
Land Authority) be allowed to decide the matter exclusively.” It further
appears that subsequently, the Land Authority promulgated judgment in the
administrative case “affirming the cancellation of Agreement to Sell No. 3482”
thus making more apparent “the folly of allowing the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case to proceed ** .” Upon these facts, it appearing that the contract on which
the plaintiff’s cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> was
founded had been cancelled by the proper administrative authority, this Court
ordered dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><i>Orellano</i></span><i> v</i>. <span class="SpellE"><i>Alvestir</i></span><i>, </i>76 SCRA 536 (1977), another
precedent cited by the petitioners, originated from an action instituted by <span class="SpellE">Alvestir</span> in the Court of First Instance praying that he be
adjudged to have the right to continue in possession of a parcel of land
despite the sale thereof by the Archbishop of Manila to <span class="SpellE">Orellano</span>
because said sale had been executed in violation of “Republic Act 1162 as
amended by Republic Act No. 1599 to the effect that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘That no lot or portion thereof actually
occupied by a tenant or occupant shall be sold by the landowner to any other
persons than such tenant or occupant, unless the latter renounces in a public
instrument his right under this Act.’” What <span class="SpellE">Orellano</span>
did was to file a suit of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> against <span class="SpellE">Alvestir</span> in the city court invoking his superior right of
possession in virtue of said sale to him by the Archbishop of Manila of the
premises in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these facts,
this Court held:<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>“ * * * <span class="SpellE">Orellano's</span> claim of better right
of possession in his complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> is
already in issue in <span class="SpellE">Alvestir's</span> action for rescission
pending in the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not matter that <span class="SpellE">Orellano</span> is defendant
in that case whereas he is plaintiff in the city court, as long as the issues
raised in the pleadings by either of the parties require the resolution of the
same cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question here
that the same parties are involved in both cases, albeit in Civil Case No.
53664, there are other parties who are not parties in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Alzua</span>
vs. Johnson, 21 Phil. 308; Juan vs. Go <span class="SpellE">Cotay</span>, 26
Phil. 328).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject matter is
possession of the identical land in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the cause of <span class="SpellE">Alvestir</span> in the Court of
First Instance case is the same cause he alleged as affirmative defense in the <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
any event, it is beyond cavil of doubt that until the question of whether or
not <span class="SpellE">Alvestir</span> has a right of priority, under the laws
invoked by him, over <span class="SpellE">Orellano</span> to purchase the land in
dispute is decided, the matter of who between appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has the better right of possession over it cannot be determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not in any way suggesting that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> action for rescission is clearly
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is apparent is that it
is not on its face groundless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention of appellant that <span class="SpellE">Alvestir</span> cannot have any
standing in law, even under the provisions of Republic Act 1162, as amended,
invoked by him is a matter that We cannot resolve here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is but proper, therefore, from any point
of view, that Civil Case No. 63664 be allowed to follow its course and the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit be dismissed.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As will be seen, a special law was a necessary factor in the <span style="">controversy, </span>which is a feature that
may well serve to distinguish the case from the precedents relied upon by the
Trial Court and the Court of Appeals in their adjudication of the cases at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, even assuming that
there is irreconcilable conflict between <span class="SpellE"><i>Orellano</i></span>
and the other precedents listed and outlined in this opinion, there is no
difficulty whatever in concluding that the overwhelming weight of authority is
decidedly contrary to <span class="SpellE"><i>Orellano</i></span><i>, </i>precluding
application thereof to the present cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may well be stressed in closing that as the law now stands,
even when, in forcible entry and unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
cases, “the defendant raises the question of ownership in his pleadings and the
question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of
ownership,” the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial courts, and
Municipal Trial Courts nevertheless have the undoubted competence to resolve
“the issue of ownership ** only to determine the issue of possession.”<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>
