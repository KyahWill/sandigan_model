				<BR><STRONG>GRINO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner, Virginia Franco, was employed by former Senator
Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> (hereafter “<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>”)
on <st1:date year="1973" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1973</st1:date> to
manage the sale, disposal, and marketing of the fish products of the <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> Fishing Industry, a single proprietorship of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
given a monthly salary of P1, 500 plus an incentive pay of one percent (1%) of
the gross sales.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1974</st1:date>,
she and <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> entered into a partnership named
ADA CONSIGNMENT to engage in the business of receiving on consignment from
suppliers, milkfish and other kinds of fish for sale to retailers in
consideration of a 4% fee or commission for the partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further stipulated that <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> would provide the capital of P50<span class="GramE">,000</span> for the operation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of
</span>the business, and the petitioner, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span>industrial partner, would furnish her skill, know-how, and
industry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The profits were to be divided
equally between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The partnership
was to exist <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for </span>two years, but
it could be terminated earlier upon the violation of any of its terms by either
of the partners, plus payment of P5, 000 as damages by the guilty partner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1972</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> terminated the services of the petitioner
as manager of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> Fishing Industry, as well as
their partnership which had existed for only ten (10) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>)
for Accounting and Damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for </span>an accounting of the gross sales
of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> Fishing Industry to determine her one
percent (1%) incentive pay from the gross sales, which she estimated at no less
than P3<span class="GramE">,500,000</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the operation of their partnership, ADA CONSIGNMENT, she
alleged that during its ten-month operation, the venture generated gross sales
of P1<span class="GramE">,400,000</span> from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">which </span>she was entitled to a four percent (4%) share as
commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for </span>an accounting of the two ventures
because she had no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">access </span>to the
books, record, and funds <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the
two businesses, <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> having appointed a
treasurer-cashier for the business.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Almendras</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> denied the allegations of the complaint and
set up a counterclaim for monies due ADA CONSIGNMENT and <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
Fishing Industry, which the petitioner allegedly misappropriated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also demanded the return to him of certain
implements and fixtures used in the business, or their value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also demanded payment of damages, the
penalty provided in the partnership agreement, and attorney’s fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner denied the allegations of the
counterclaim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Court directed the
plaintiff, now petitioner, to designate an accountant to examine the books of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The pre-trial was reset
several times because petitioner’s accountant was not ready yet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court reset the pre-trial conference for
the last time on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">September 3, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> with notice to both parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

evidence in support of his counterclaim on <st1:date year="1976" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1976</st1:date>, and the case was submitted for decision

the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> rendered a
decision for the defendant, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">“IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby renders judgment in
favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, to wit:</p>

<p class="2Q">“(1) Plaintiff is ordered to pay defendant the sum of P70<span class="GramE">,747.35</span> representing the balance due from customers of the ‘<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> Fishing Industry;’</p>

having a total value of P9,090.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the event, plaintiff cannot return all or any piece thereof, on account <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>loss or
destruction, plaintiff is ordered to pay defendant their price or that of any
piece thereof as above listed;</p>

<p class="2Q">“(3) Plaintiff is ordered to pay defendant the sum of Five Thousand
Pesos (P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as liquidated damages (penalty) and
the sum of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) as attorney’s fees;</p>

53-54, Record on Appeal; p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals which modified the
trial court’s decision by eliminating the liquidated damages and reducing the
attorney’s <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">fees to P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Franco filed this petition for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">review on the ground that the Court of Appeals erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. <span class="GramE">in</span> upholding the trial court’s order
declaring her non-suited;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">2. in </span>giving
probative value to defendant’s Exhibit “3” in support of the counterclaim; and</p>

<p class="BODY">3. <span class="GramE">in</span> affirming the awards in favor of
the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The petitioner was
properly declared non-suited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
observed by the Court of Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“The records show that plaintiff and counsel took it on themselves
to be absent from the September 3, 1976 pre-trial on three grounds - (1) that
plaintiff was ill; (2) that counsel had another case to attend to; and (3)
that, anyway, the accountant was present to inform the court that the report on
reconciliation of amounts would not be submitted because of defendant’s refusal
to show the books of account.</p>

<p class="2Q">“The proper thing to do was to file a motion to postpone the
pre-trial, assuming the truth of the statements that plaintiff was ill and that
counsel had another case to attend to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This plaintiff did not do, obviously on the assumption that the presence
of the accountant was enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
clear to <span class="GramE">Us</span> that both the plaintiff and her counsel
were guilty at least of disrespect to the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having lapsed into the error of not filling a
motion for postponement on grounds, one of which could have some validity, they
committed a yet bigger one in delegating to the accountant the duty to appear
for them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, even if the
accountant’s presence was made known to the Court, matters could not have been
set right, for the simple reason that the accountant is not a party to the
case.” <span class="GramE">(p. 29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The purpose of Section 2,
Rule 20 of the Rules of Court is to ensure the appearance of the parties at the
pre-trial conference (Junco vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 78051, November 8,
1989).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the failure of the
petitioner to appear at the pre-trial was not due to fraud, accident, mistake
or excusable negligence, the appellate court did not err in upholding the trial
court’s </span><span class="SpellE"><u>nolle</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>prosequi</u></span><u>
</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">order against her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

customers of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> Fishing Industry, and whether
or not the other monetary awards are supported by the evidence, are factual
issues which this Court is disinclined to review except under special
circumstances which are not present in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The general rule is that factual findings of
the lower courts are entitled to great weight and respect (Manahan vs. People,
