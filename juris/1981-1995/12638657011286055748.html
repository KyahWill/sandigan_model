				<H3>BASILIO C. GUTIERREZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LEONARDO N. ZULUETA, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This case pertains to
disciplinary proceedings initiated by the herein complainant <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> C. Gutierrez against the herein respondent Atty.
Leonardo N. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="10"><span style="">October
 13, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
complainant filed with this Court a sworn letter-complaint dated </span><st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="10"><span style="">October
 11, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> seeking the
disbarment of the respondent lawyer on the grounds of dishonesty and conduct
unbecoming of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">member of the legal profession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complainant alleges
that the respondent lawyer was his counsel in two cases, namely, a workmen's
compensation case and a civil case filed with the then Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint concerns the latter case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant filed the said civil case against his <span class="GramE">former</span> employer, the Singer Sewing Machine Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court ruled in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the said
appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court and ruled in favor of
the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is categorically stated
in the said decision that the complainant did not file a brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he maintains that the case was resolved
against him primarily because his lawyer, the herein respondent, did not file
the required <span style="">brief with the appellate
court and such omission is attributable </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the dishonesty of the
respondent lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In support of his contention, the complainant alleges that
sometime <span style="">in </span>August 1976, the
respondent lawyer, who was then in Manila, wired him to send the amount of
P400.00 to <span style="">cover the expenses in
relation to the preparation and printing of the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief, and upon receipt of the message, he sent the said amount to the
respondent lawyer through the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also alleges that he sent a telegram to
the </span><span style="">respondent lawyer for </span><span style="">the purpose of informing the latter that the
P400.00 can be obtained at the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, </span><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place><span style=""> branch office of the same bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that sometime thereafter, the respondent lawyer
assured the complainant that the brief had already been filed in court and that
a copy thereof will be made <span style="">available
to the latter in due time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It also appears that
immediately after the complainant received a copy of the decision of the Court
of Appeals, he reported the matter to the provincial governor inasmuch as the
respondent lawyer is the provincial legal counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An investigation ensued but the same failed
to settle the problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stated earlier, the
complainant eventually brought </span>the matter to the attention of this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1981</st1:date>, the <span style="">C</span>ourt
resolved to refer the matter to the Office of the Solicitor General for
investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the investigation that
ensued, the respondent lawyer testified that he received the amount of P400.00
from the complainant for the purpose of</span> <span style="">preparing the said brief and that he gave the said amount to his
secretary to cover the </span>expenses to be incurred in such preparation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that he had to leave for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
at that time and that he instructed his secretary to attend to the filing of
the brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise stated that
sometime thereafter, his secretary assured him that the brief had been filed
already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that he could not
furnish the complainant with <span style="">a</span>
copy of the brief inasmuch as his secretary, for undisclosed reasons, left the
office, taking with her his records and his typewriter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent lawyer adm<span style="">i</span>ts that he received the additional
amount of P100.00 from the complainant for the purpose of securing a copy of
the brief for the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In due time, the Office
of the Solicitor General filed its report </span>recommending <span style="">therein that the respondent lawyer be found
guilty of not having exercised the due diligence required of a member of the
legal profession in connection with his duties to his clients and accordingly
impose upon him the penalty </span>of suspension <span style="">from the practice of law for a period of one year.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record of the case
undoubtedly discloses that the respondent lawyer failed to exercise due
diligence in protecting and attending to the interest of his client, the herein
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the
respondent lawyer to undertake the necessary measures to submit the required
brief certainly caused material prejudice to the complainant inasmuch as the
appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court which was in favor of
the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The explanation given by
the respondent lawyer to the effect that the failure is attributable to the
negligence of his secretary is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A responsible lawyer is expected to supervise the work in his office
with respect to all the pleadings to be filed in court and he should not
delegate this responsibility, lock, stock and barrel, to his office
secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were otherwise, irresponsible
members of the legal profession can avoid appropriate disciplinary action by
simply disavowing liability and attributing the problem to the fault </span>or <span style="">negligence of the office secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such situation will not be countenanced by
this Court.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In sum, therefore, this
Court is of the well-considered opinion that the respondent lawyer failed to
live up to the </span>duties and responsibilities of a member of the legal
profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His suspension from the
practice of law is in <span style="">order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, Atty. Leonardo N. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>
is hereby suspended from the practice </span>of <span style="">law for a period of one (1) year effective from the date of his receipt
of this resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is advised to
henceforth exercise greater care and diligence in the performance of his duties
towards his clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision is
immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and no motion for extension of
time to file a motion for reconsideration will be entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let copies of this resolution be attached to
his personal record and circulated among the different courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
