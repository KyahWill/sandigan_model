charged <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span> <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>-Garcia,
a clerk-stenographer in Branch V of the city court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, with willful failure to pay just debts and frequent unauthorized absences
or tardiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Garcia denied the charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> had filed a reply and Mrs.
Garcia had submitted a rejoinder, the case was referred to the executive judge
of the city court for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Willful failure to pay just debts</u>.</span>
- The evidence shows that sometime in May, 1975, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span>,
66, <span style="">a </span>retired government
employee and her sister, <span class="SpellE">Mariquita</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Felarca</span>, leased to <span style="">Mrs.
</span>Garcia and her husband a room on the ground floor of her house located
at 16 <span class="SpellE">Banahaw</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City for a monthly rental of one hundred pesos
payable within the first five days of the month, with free light and water.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Garcia spouses complied faithfully with their obligation for
the first few months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, they
defaulted and their arrearages piled up.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1975</st1:date>,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> caused respondent's husband, Reynaldo to
sign a document captioned "Reynaldo Garcia Rental Schedule of
Payment" under which he agreed to pay on a staggered basis up to <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1976</st1:date> the back rentals
amounting to P589 as of December, 1975 together with the rental for January,
1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Mrs. Garcia also signed
that agreement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">Because the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> only made sporadic
payments, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> reminded them of their
obligation in her letter dated <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In May, 1979 when
the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span>' obligations <span class="SpellE">totalled</span>
P1<span class="GramE">,505.00</span>, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin's</span>
lawyer sent them a pay-and-vacate demand letter dated May 31, 1979, giving them
until the end of June, 1979 to settle their account and to leave the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1979</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> paid fifty pesos but did not vacate the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of that date, their back
rentals amounted to P1<span class="GramE">,555.00</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
Z)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On</span> <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1979</st1:date>, Mrs.<span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit against the Garcia spouses in the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">city</span> court (Civil
Case No. 35986).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, she lodged with the executive judge of the city
court the administrative complaint against Mrs. Garcia. (See sec. 36[b<span class="GramE">][</span>22], Civil Service Decree, Presidential Decree No. 807.)</p>

<p class="BODY">As a counter-move, the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> filed
with the city court on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1979</st1:date>
a petition for consignation of rentals. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They alleged that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span>
had deliberately refused to accept their payments so that she would have a
pretext to eject them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Eventually, or as of August, 1980 and shortly
before the hearing of this administrative case, the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span>
were able to pay the back rentals.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The investigator found that Mrs. Garcia deliberately failed to pay the
back rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That finding is supported
by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Tardiness</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> As to the charge of
tardiness or irregular office attendance, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span>
attached to her complaint the affidavits of Monica <span class="SpellE">Rance</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cristobella</span> <span class="SpellE">Engana</span> who
alleged that Mrs. Garcia invariably left her residence at nine o'clock in the
morning and returned at about four in the afternoon, carrying with her a
plastic bag containing fresh fish, meat and vegetables which she cooked in the
morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigator found that the second charge was not
proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vague and inconsistent
testimonies of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berdin's</span> witnesses cannot prevail
over Mrs. Garcia's time records which show that she maintained regular office
hours (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 8 to 16-C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is hereby exculpated from that charge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> for willful failure to pay just debts, resÂ­pondent
Mrs. Garcia is ordered to pay a fine equivalent to her salary for fifteen
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of this decision should be
attached to her personal record.</p>
