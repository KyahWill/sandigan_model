Service Insurance System for medical services, appliance and supplies and

explained his claim and bolstered it with citations of case digests reported in
various issues of the Manila Daily Bulletin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Realizing his need for professional assistance, we referred him to the
Citizens Legal Assistance Office, which thereafter prepared and submitted the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Permanent total
disability was described by the Court in <span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> v.

<blockquote>Other authoritative comments on the coverage of the term ‘permanent
total disability' as used in the Workmen's Compensation Act, are (a) Comments
and Annotations on the Workmen's Compensation Act by <span class="SpellE">Severo</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Pucan</span> and Cornelio R. <span class="SpellE">Besinga</span>,
that 'total disability does not mean a state of absolute helplessness, but
means disablement of an employee to earn wages in the same kind of work, or a
work of similar nature, that he was trained for or accustomed to perform, or
any kind of work which a person of his mentality and attainment could do;’ (b)
Philippine Labor and Social Legislation by Justice <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
Martin, that 'permanent total disability means disablement of an employee to
earn wages in the same kind of work, or work of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

perform, or any other kind of work which <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a

<span class="SpellE">x</span>;’ and (c) Labor Standards and Welfare Legislation
by Perfecto Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiason</span>
that 'permanent total disability means an incapacity to perform gainful work
which is expected to be permanent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
status does not require a condition of complete helplessness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it affected by the performance of
occasional odd jobs' (cited in <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> vs. Seven-up
Bottling Co. of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
47 SCRA 343).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Permanent partial
disability, on the other hand, is defined as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>A disability is partial permanent if as a result of the injury or
sickness the employee suffers a permanent partial loss of the use of any part
of his body.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is important to
consider that the petitioner opted to retire when he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only 60 years of age although he was entitled
to continue during good behavior for five more years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact, it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">urged, should
indicate that he was no longer able to cope with his work because of his
illness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is also noted that the
GSIS paid him what it called his partial permanent benefits </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a total of 150 days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our
attention is called to Section 2, Rule 7 of the </span>Amended Rules on
Employees' Compensation, providing that "a total disability is permanent
if as a result of the injury or sickness the employee is unable to perform any
gainful occupation for a continuous period exceeding 120 days."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment, the Solicitor General contends that the
description of the petitioner's ailment does not by itself prove that he has
been permanently and totally disabled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also argues that the evaluation of the nature and duration of the
employee's illness is vested solely in the GSIS whose findings should be
respected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the certification
made by the petitioner's attending physician, he contends that "a mere
general statement by his physician that he has been rendered permanently and
totally disabled by his illness is not sufficient to serve as a basis for
granting him permanent and total disability benefits under Art. 192."</p>

<p class="BODY">The public respondent has apparently forgotten that in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bello</span></st1:place></st1:city> v. Workmen's Compensation
Commission,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that "the doctor's certification as to the nature of the
claimant's disability may be given credence as he normally would not make a
false certification." This ruling was a reiteration of <span class="SpellE">Marte</span>
v. Employees Compensation Commission,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>No physician in his right mind and who is aware of the far-reaching
and serious effect that his statements would cause on a money claim filed with
a government agency, would issue certifications indiscriminately without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">even minding his own interests and
protection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="GramE">Under</span> normal circumstances, he would not sacrifice his
medical career for the sake of a lowly public school teacher.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We find that this case is
similar to <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> v. Employees' Compensation Commission,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

from her work as a teacher, at the age of 49, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">"as a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">direct consequence of her hypertension and <span class="SpellE">ametropia</span>,"
or dimness of vision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court, in
reversing the public respondent there, held <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Petitioner could not in all honesty be deemed entitled to merely
partial disability benefit; because she has been forced out of work and has
been rendered incapable of further pursuing her usual job which is
teaching.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not only her
"ability to perform her usual task" which was impaired, and her
"efficiency and competence for work as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>earning capacity" which was reduced; but ultimately,
herein petitioner had to let go of her job as a teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was forced to retire because her illness
rendered her incapable of teaching (<span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> v. WCC,
et al., <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> v. 7-Up Bottling Co.
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<u>supra</u>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, the fact of an employee's disability is placed beyond
question with the approval of the employee's optional retirement for such is
authorized only when the employee is "physically incapable to render sound
and efficient service" under C.A. 186, as amended by Republic Act 4968 in
conjunction with Memorandum Circular No. 133 of the Office of the President on
October 19, 1967 (<span class="SpellE">Faicol</span> v. WCC and Republic of the
Philippines, 93 SCRA 811 [1979]; Roma v. WCC and Bureau of Public Schools, 80
SCRA 170 [1977]; Romero v. WCC and Bureau of Public Schools, 77 SCRA 842
[1977]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>When an employee is forced to ask for retirement ahead of schedule,
not because of old age, but primarily of his weakened bodily condition due to
illness contracted in the course of her employment, she should be given <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">compensation for her inability to work during
the remaining days before her scheduled retirement, aside from the benefits
received by her (<span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span> v. Republic of the
Philippines, 98 SCRA 383 [1980]; <span class="SpellE">Almaiz</span> v. WCC, 85
SCRA 144 [1978]; <span class="SpellE">Bello</span> v. WCC, 80 SCRA 153 [1977]; <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> v. 7–Up Bottling Co. of the Philippines, <u>supra</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no reason to digress from this ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the herein petitioner's ailments are
even more serious than in <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, and he has even
worked longer for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, therefore, that the petitioner is entitled to permanent
total compensation benefits to be determined in accordance with Section 5, Rule
XI of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation providing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">And
as the record is silent as to the petitioner's monthly salary, we hereby fix
the said compensation in the maximum amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We also hold that the petitioner is entitled to reimbursement for
his expenses incurred for medical services, appliances and other supplies in
connection with his ailment, conformably to Section 4, Rule VII of the Amended
Rules on Employees' Compensation.</p>
