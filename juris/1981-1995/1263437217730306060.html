				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pfc. Reynaldo P. Angeles was dispatched in the early morning of 5
November 1987 to Tinio St., Sta. Maria Phase I, Balibago, Angeles City, where
the decapitated body of a man, later identified through his voter’s
identification card as Nestor de Loyola, was found in a grassy portion thereof.  Apart from the decapitation, the deceased
bore forty-three (43) stab wounds in the chest as well as slight burns all over
the body.  The head was found some two
(2) feet away from the corpse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Five persons, Ruben E. Ilaoa, Rogelio E. Ilaoa, Rodel E. Ilaoa,
Julius Eliginio and Edwin Tapang, were charged for the gruesome murder of
Nestor de Loyola.  However, only the
brothers Ruben and Rogelio stood trial since the other accused escaped and were
never apprehended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 June 1990, the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City found
Ruben and Rogelio guilty of murder with the attendant circumstances of evident
premeditation, abuse of superior strength and cruelty, and imposed upon them
the penalty of “life imprisonment.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> The
conviction was based on the following circumstantial evidence:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>One</u>.  The deceased
Nestor de Loyola was seen at about eleven o’clock in the evening of 4 November
1987, in a drinking session with his <i><span style="">compadre</span></i><span style=""> </span>Ruben Ilaoa together with Julius
Eliginio, Edwin Tapang and a certain “Nang Kwang” outside Ruben’s apartment.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Two</u>.  The drunken
voices of Ruben and Nestor engaged in an apparent argument were later on heard.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Nestor was then seen being kicked and mauled by Ruben and his brother Rodel,
Julius Eliginio and Edwin <span style="">Tapang.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Nestor was crying all the while, “Pare,
aray, aray!” Afterwards, Nestor, who appeared drunk, was seen being “dragged”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> into Ruben Ilaoa’s apartment.  Nestor was heard saying, “Pare, bakit ninyo
ako ginaganito, hirap na hirap na ako!”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Three</u>.  Ruben Ilaoa
and Julius Eliginio borrowed Alex Villamil’s tricycle at about two o’clock the
following morning allegedly for the purpose of bringing to the hospital a
neighbor who was about to give birth.  Ruben was seen driving the tricycle alone, with a sack which looked as
though it contained a human body, placed in the sidecar.  The tricycle was returned an hour later to
Alex who noticed bloodstains on the floor.  The latter thought that they were those of the pregnant woman.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Four</u>.  Blood was
found on Ruben’s shirt when he was asked to lift it during the investigation by
the police.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Moreover, Ruben’s hair near his right
forehead was found partly burned and his shoes were splattered with blood.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Susan Ocampo, Ruben’s live-in partner, was likewise seen in the early morning <span style="">of 5 November 1987 sweeping what appeared to
be blood at the entrance of their apartment.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, brothers Ruben and Rogelio Ilaoa argue for their
acquittal.  They contend that the
circumstantial evidence relied upon by the trial court for their conviction
failed to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Specifically, they assail the finding of
evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength and cruelty as totally
unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm Ruben Ilaoa’s guilt having been satisfactorily
established by the evidence on hand, albeit circumstantial.  However, we reverse the conviction of
Rogelio as we find it patently baseless.</p>

<p class="BODY">In finding Rogelio guilty of murder, the court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>relied solely on the testimony that he helped his brother Ruben
drag Nestor de Loyola inside Ruben’s apartment where the deceased was last seen
alive.  Apart from such testimony,
however, there is nothing else to link Rogelio to the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">To warrant a conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence,
three requisites must concur:  (a) there
must be more than one circumstance; (b) the circumstances from which the
inferences are derived are proven; and, (c) the combination of all the
circumstances is such as to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bench, it does not require much analysis to conclude that the
circumstance relied upon to establish Rogelio Ilaoa’s guilt, i.e., the alleged
dragging of the deceased to his brother’s apartment, is totally inadequate for
a conviction, having miserably failed to meet the criteria.  This is especially so where the veracity of
such circumstance is even open to question.  While Antonio Ramos and Abdulia Logan testified that Rogelio Ilaoa
helped his brother drag the deceased to his apartment, Eustancia Bie who
claimed to have witnessed the same incident positively testified that it was
Ruben Ilaoa and Julius Eliginio who did so.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Rogelio Ilaoa was not mentioned.  Not
having been adequately established, in addition to being uncorroborated, such
circumstance alone cannot be the basis of Rogelio’s conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruben’s case, however, is a totally different matter.  Unlike that of his brother, Ruben Ilaoa’s
fate was most definitely assured by the unbroken chain of circumstances which
culminated in the discovery of Nestor de Loyola’s decapitated body in the early
morning of 5 November 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court, in the late evening of 4 November
1987, appellant Ruben Ilaoa was engaged in a drinking session with the deceased
Nestor de Loyola together with several others.  Ruben was heard arguing with Nestor.  A few moments later, Ruben mauled and kicked the deceased with the help
of their drinking companions just outside Ruben’s apartment.  As the deceased cried “Aray! Aray!” and
“Pare, bakit ‘nyo ako ginaganito? Hirap na hirap na ako!” appellant dragged the
deceased with the help of Julius Eliginio to the apartment from where a man’s
cries were continued to be heard later.  To further seal the case against him, Ruben borrowed Alex Villamil’s
tricycle at two o’clock in the morning of 5 November 1987 on the pretext that a
neighbor was about to give birth and had to be rushed to the hospital.  However, he was seen driving the tricycle
alone with a sack placed in the sidecar.  The sack looked as if it contained a human body.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, an hour later, or at three o’clock in the morning, the tricycle was
returned with bloodstains on the floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his defense, appellant Ruben Ilaoa does not dispute the
testimony of an eyewitness that he was driving the tricycle at past two o’clock
in the morning with the sack in the sidecar.  However, he claims that the sack contained <i><span style="">buntot ng pusa</span></i><span style="">, a </span>local
term for <i><span style="">marijuana</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">not a human </span>body, which he delivered to a designated place in
Fields Avenue as a favor to his <i><span style="">compadre</span></i><span style=""> </span>Nestor de Loyola whom he could not
refuse.  Moreover, it was the vomit
discharged by his drinking companions that was being swept clean by his
girlfriend at the entrance of their apartment in the early morning of 5
November 1987, not blood as the witnesses asseverated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the version of the prosecution more persuasive than the
defense.  The fact that appellant
quarreled with the deceased, then mauled and pulled him to the apartment where
the latter was last seen alive, in addition to borrowing a tricycle which was found
with bloodstains when returned, sufficiently point to <span style="">Ruben as the culprit </span>responsible for the crime.  The fact that the deceased was his <i><span style="">compadre</span></i><span style="">, </span>hence, presumably would have no motive to kill the latter, is
not enough to exculpate appellant.  It
is a matter of judicial knowledge that persons have been killed or assaulted
for no apparent reason at all,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> and
that friendship or even relationship is no deterrent to the commission of a
crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If we are to believe appellant Ruben, we will not be able to
account for the blood found on the floor of the tricycle after it was brought
back to the owner.  Ruben himself could
not explain away such testimony for he belied the excuse that the tricycle was
needed to rush a pregnant woman to the hospital, which was the explanation he
gave to Alex Villamil when he borrowed it.  We cannot even consider that the story about the blood on the tricycle
was simply concocted by Alex Villamil to incriminate Ruben because the latter
was his friend, as Ruben himself has admitted.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> In
fact he could think of no reason for Alex Villamil to testify falsely against
him.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the foregoing, however, we hold appellant liable only for
homicide, not murder, on the ground that the qualifying circumstances alleged
in the information, namely, abuse of superior strength, cruelty and evident
premeditation, were not sufficiently proved to be appreciated against
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Abuse of superior strength cannot be considered because there was
no evidence whatsoever that appellant was physically superior to the deceased
and that the former took advantage of such superior physical strength to
overcome the latter’s resistance to consummate the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that Nestor de Loyola’s decapitated body bearing forty-three (43) stab
wounds, twenty-four (24) of which were fatal,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> was
found dumped in the street is not sufficient for a finding of cruelty where
there is no showing that appellant Ruben Ilaoa, for his pleasure and
satisfaction, caused Nestor de Loyola to suffer slowly and painfully and
inflicted on him unnecessary physical and moral pain.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Number of wounds alone is not the criterion for the appreciation of cruelty as
an aggravating circumstance.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither can it be inferred from the mere fact that the victim’s dead body was
dismembered.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Evident premeditation cannot likewise be considered.  There is nothing in the records to show that appellant, prior to
the night in question, resolved to kill Nestor de Loyola, nor is there proof to
show that such killing was the result of meditation, calculation or resolution
on his part.  On the contrary, the
evidence tends to show that the series of circumstances which culminated in the
killing constitutes an unbroken chain of events with no interval of time separating
them for calculation and meditation.  Absent any qualifying circumstance, Ruben Ilaoa should only be held
liable for homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty prescribed for homicide in Art. 249 of the Revised
Penal Code is <i>reclusion temporal</i>.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and in the absence of any
mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the maximum shall be taken from the
medium period of <i><span style="">reclusion temporal</span></i><span style="">, </span>which is fourteen (14) years, eight
(8) months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, while
the minimum shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree, which is <i>prision
</i><i><span style="">mayor</span></i><span style="">, </span>in any of its periods, the range of
which is six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">In line with present jurisprudence, the civil indemnity fixed by
the court <i>a quo</i> for the death of Nestor de Loyola is increased from
P30,000.00 to P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment finding accused RUBEN E. ILAOA
guilty beyond reasonable doubt is <span style="">AFFIRMED
</span>but only for homicide, instead of murder.  Consequently, he is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of
eight (8) years, ten (10) months and twenty (20) days of <i>prision mayor</i>
medium, as minimum, to sixteen (16) years, four (4) months and ten (10) days of
<i><span style="">reclusion </span>temporal</i> <span style="">medium as </span>maximum.  In addition, accused-appellant RUBEN E.
ILAOA is ordered to pay the heirs of Nestor de Loyola P50,000.00 as civil
indemnity and, as fixed by the court <i>a quo</i>, P46,765.00 as actual
damages, P10,000.00 as reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation,
and P10,000.00 for moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant ROGELIO E. ILAOA, however, is <span style="">ACQUITTED </span>of the crime charged for
obvious insufficiency of evidence.</p>
