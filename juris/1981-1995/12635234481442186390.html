parties in the respective amounts above listed." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 197-200.)

</p><p>Only Policronio Escalante, Lope Daigan, Domingo Borneo and 
Melchor Prado were brought to trial.  It was Judge Bernardo Ll. Salas 
who tried the case in Baybay, Leyte but he inhibited himself from 
rendering judgment because of "reports that a certain person in this 
town has been collecting money from several parties in connection with 
this case." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 900.) Accordingly, the case was decided by Executive Judge Jesus N. Borromeo who rendered the following judgment:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered declaring 
accused Melchor Prado guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the complex 
offense of multiple robbery with homicide, with the attendance of three 
aggravating circumstances not off set by any mitigating, and he is 
sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH. </p>
  <p>"The Court further orders accused Prado to indemnify the heirs of 
deceased Domiciana Castro in the amount of P12,000.00; to pay offended 
parties:  (1) Un Se Eng, the amount of P3,000.00; (2) Uy Pho Ho, the 
amount of P4,000.00; (3) Jao Kee Tiong, the amount of P12,000.00; (4) Un
 Giong the amount of P33,000.00; (5) Virgilio Olan, the amount of 
P865.00; (6) Marcelo Lorden, the amount of P113.00; and (7) Guillermo 
Flores, the amount of P439.00, consisting of the respective values of 
the properties stolen from them; and to pay one-fourth (1/4) of the 
costs. </p>
  <p>"Judgment is also rendered finding accused Domingo Borneo guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of being an accomplice in the complex offense of
 multiple robbery with homicide, with the attendance of three (3) 
aggravating circumstances not off set by any mitigating, and he is 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of from TWELVE (12) years of Prision 
Mayor to TWENTY (20) years of reclusion temporal; to indemnify the heirs
 of deceased Domiciana Castro in the amount of P12,000.00, or any 
portion thereof which accused Prado may not be able to pay; and to pay 
the above-enumerated offended parties the amounts respectively setforth 
in the preceding paragraph, or any portion thereof which accused Prado 
may not be able to pay, and to pay one-fourth (1/4) of the costs. </p>
  <p>"The preventive imprisonment accused Domingo Borneo may have been 
undertaken shall be deducted from the term of imprisonment imposed 
herein to its full extent if he signed an agreement to abide by the same
 rules imposed upon convicted prisoners while in confinement or only 
four-fifths (4/5) thereof if he has not signed said agreement. </p>
  <p>"Finally, judgment is also rendered declaring accused Policronio 
Escalante and Lope Daigan not guilty of the complex offense of multiple 
robbery with homicide charged in the information and they are, 
therefore, acquitted from said charge, with two-fourths (2/4) of the 
costs de oficio. </p>
  <p>"It appearing that they are presently detained in the Provincial 
Jail, the Court hereby orders the provincial warden to immediately 
release therefrom accused Policronio Escalante and Lope Daigan, unless 
they are held therein also for other charges." (<em>Id.,</em> pp. 959-962.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence for the prosecution as summarized in the People's brief is as follows:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>"At past 6:00 o'clock in the evening of February 21, 1972, while 
Sgt. Arsenio Lipar was in the Philippine Constabulary (PC) detachment in
 the poblacion of Baybay, Leyte (p. 81, tsn., Arradaza) with no 
companions, as the other members of the detach­ment were then out on 
patrol (p. 128, id.), four (4) men entered the detachment.  One of them 
inquired from Sgt. Lipar what time the boat from Manila would arrive, 
but before the latter could answer, the stranger drew his pistol and 
pushed it to the side of Sgt. Lipar, and then he also pushed Sgt. Lipar 
into the room of the detachment and made him face the wall.  The four 
men were all armed, one with a grease gun, two with .45 cal. pistols, 
and the fourth with a .38 cal. revolver.  One of the armed men took the 
armalite weapon which was propped against the wall, and all four also 
tried but failed to get a carbine which was handcuffed to a bunk bed 
inside the room (p. 82, id.).  Unable to produce the key to open the 
handcuff, Sgt. Lipar was mauled by the four (pp. 82-83, id.), as a 
result of which he sustained contusions on the chest, abdomen, and left 
thigh that took nine days to heal (pp. 97-98, <em>id.,</em> Exh. "A", p.
 20, Rec.).  The four men also took Lipar's .38 cal. Llama pistol, which
 they discovered on his person after one of them boxed him on the 
abdomen.  The group also ransacked Sgt. Lipar's bag, and as they were 
doing so, they were covering him with a pistol pointed at his neck (pp. 
83-84, id.). </p>
  <p>"From the PC detachment, the band proceeded to the municipal 
building of Baybay, taking along with them Sgt. Lipar (p. 84, id.).  
Inside the radio room of the municipal building at the time were 
Patrolman Guillermo Flores, who was on duty as a radio operator (p. 11, 
id.), and Patrolman Marcelo Lor­dan, who was the building guard, both of
 the Baybay Police Department (p. 80, tsn., Rodriguez).  Hearing some 
noises outside, Pat. Lordan went out and saw Sgt. Lipar and three of the
 armed men.  He tried to inquire from Sgt. Lipar what was happening, but
 the latter could not talk.  Then the man behind Sgt. Lipar fired at the
 latter but missed.  Almost simultaneously, another man approached Pat. 
Lordan, pointed a gun at his back, and ordered him to stretch his arms 
(pp. 81-82, tsn., Rodriguez).  Meanwhile, still another member of the 
band entered the radio room and ordered Pat. Flores not to move (p. 11, 
tsn., Arradaza), simultaneously firing at the radio equipment.  The 
armed stranger then disarmed Pat. Flores and told him to go out of the 
building with raised hands (pp. 12-13, id.).  The band also took a riot 
gun from the radio room (p. 87, tsn., Rodriguez). </p>
  <p>"From the municipal building, Sgt. Lipar and Patrolmen Flores and 
Lordan, with their hands raised, were asked to proceed to the Vital 
Store some 100 meters away, the armed men closely behind them.  While 
one of the band guarded their three hostages, whom they ordered to face 
the Family Theatre, his companions entered the store (pp. 14, 85, 86, 
tsn, Arradaza; pp. 83-85, tsn., Rodriguez).  After having been made to 
stand outside the store for about 20 minutes, Sgt. Lipar and the two 
policemen were told by their captors to lie down on their bellies on the
 sidewalk (p. 86, Rodriguez; p. 86, Arradaza).  Meanwhile, some five to 
eight more armed men arrived and also entered the store (pp. 85-86, 
Rodriguez; pp. 86-87, Arradaza).  It was while Sgt. Lipar was lying on 
his belly on the sidewalk that he turned his head towards the inside of 
the store and saw and identified thereat the accused Melchor Prado and 
Domingo Borneo (pp. 87-89, Arradaza).  It was also while in that same 
position that Pat. Flores was divested by the band of his watch worth 
P350.00, his ring valued at P20.00, and cash of about P67.00 (p. 18, 
id.), while Pat. Lordan was divested of his cash of P78.00 and a wrist 
watch worth P35.00 (p. 87, Rodriguez). </p>
  <p>"Inside the store, the band ordered the store-owner, Uy Pho Ho, to 
open the drawers and vault and took therefrom cash in the aggregate 
amount of about P4,500.00, jewelry worth about P1,000.00, and watches 
valued at P2,000.00.  During the robbery, one of the armed robbers 
struck Ho on the head, which caused the latter to bleed profusely, after
 which the robber also shot him at his right ear (pp. 38-46, id.; Exh. 
"D", p. 42, Rec.).  Moreover, one Domiciana Castro, a helper who had 
earlier gone to the second floor of the store, was killed by a bullet 
from one of the guns fired by the band at the height of the robbery (p. 
45, tsn., Rodriguez; p. 15, tsn, Arradaza; Death Certificate, p. 17, 
Rec.; autopsy report, p. 19, Rec.). </p>
  <p>"After the robbery, the band ordered Sgt. Lipar and Patrolmen 
Flores and Lordan, along with some civilians, to march to the wharf 
where other compa­nions of the band were waiting.  The armed group, Sgt.
 Lipar estimated to consist by this time of about twenty (20) persons, 
then boarded a large pumpboat.  It was only when the last robber had 
left for the pumpboat that Sgt. Lipar and the policemen were able to run
 away (pp. 16, 90-92, Arradaza; pp. 90, 91, Rodriguez). </p>
  <p>"It appears that at the time of the aforesaid robberies at the PC 
detachment, the municipal building, and the Vital Store, other robberies
 were also being committed by other members of the band in other stores.
  Thus, five armed men also entered the Baybay Commercial owned by Un Se
 Eng that same evening and robbed him of P3,100.00 in cash (pp. 64-65, 
tsn, Rodriguez).  Dominador Chiong and PC Lt. Virgilio Olan also 
happened to be at the Baybay Commercial at the time, and when Lt. Olan 
tried to draw his gun, one of the robbers struck him on the head with a 
shotgun, then took his gun, his class ring, his watch, and his cash of 
P130.00, after which he was ordered to get inside the bodega of the 
store (pp. 148-149, 157 &amp; 65, id.).  The robbers then took Un Se Eng
 along with them and proceeded to the house of Eng's father Un Ciong.  
When Ciong failed to immediately open the door of the house, the robbers
 even mauled Eng (p. 67, id.; Exh. "F", p. 36, Rec.).  Then, after they 
got into the house, the band robbed Ciong of cash in the amount of about
 P25,000.00 and jewelry and valuables worth about P8,000.00.  One of 
them also knocked and injured Ciong in the head (pp. 76-78, tsn, id.; 
Exh. "G", p. 39, Rec.). </p>
  <p>"Jao Kee Tiong, a retired merchant, was in the store of his 
common-law wife that fateful evening of February 21, 1972, when two (2) 
men - one armed with a pistol and the other, with a rifle, also entered 
his store and robbed him of cash in the amount of P3,000.00 and jewelry 
worth about P9,000.00.  The robbers also kicked Tiong and hit him on the
 left side of the head with a pistol when he could not produce the key 
to one of the rooms (pp. 2-8, tsn, Arradaza; Exh. "I", p. 32, Rec.). </p>
  <p>"Luckily, Lt. Olan was able to escape from the bodega of the Baybay
 Commercial store.  After securing a carbine, he encountered the same 
armed group that had previously robbed said store, and in the exchange 
of fire, one of the robbers was fatally shot (pp. 149-150, tsn, 
Rodriguez; Exh. "E", p­-18, Rec.).  The dead robber was later identified
 as one Avelino Flores, an ex-convict from Cebu City (pp. 36-37, tsn, 
Arradaza). </p>
  <p>"The circumstances antecedent to the commission of the robberies in
 question are revealed by the accused Melchor Prado in three separate 
sworn statements executed and signed by him, substantial and material 
portions of which are quoted in the appealed decision and marked as 
Exhibits "T", "U", and "V" (pp. 49, 51 &amp; 53, Rec.; English 
translations, Exhs. "T-1" &amp; "U-1", pp. 50-52, Rec.). </p>
  <p>"In his first statement marked Exhibit "T", which was taken down by
 PC Sgt Leonardo Dairo on February 24, 1972, Prado stated, among other 
things, that on February 20, 1972, he requested one Ambrosio Polo to buy
 bullets for a .30 cal. carbine; that said bullets were, according to 
his co-accused Domingo Borneo and two unidentified persons, to be used 
in a robbery that would be pulled by them somewhere in the poblacion of 
Baybay; and that Polo in fact gave him 6 rounds of bullets at 1:00 
o'clock in the afternoon of February 21, 1972. </p>
  <p>"In his second sworn statement marked Exhibit "U", which was also 
taken down by Sgt. Dairo on February 25, 1972, Prado further disclosed 
that on February 17, 1972, he attended a conference in Ormoc City in 
connection with the robbery that was to be staged in Baybay; that with 
Boy Montemayor, who called the conference, were Rudy and Carling; that 
in that meeting, he was informed by said other conferees that they would
 go to Baybay on Februa­ry 20, 1972 to see the place, and that they in 
fact arrived in said municipality on February 20, 1972; that he later 
informed his co-accused Domingo Borneo about the result of the 
conference in Ormoc City; that on February 21, 1972, other members of 
the Montemayor group arrived in Baybay by pumpboat, among them the 
accused Pedring Tan, Boy Cabejas, and one Simo and Carling from Cebu; 
that the pump-boat docked at the wharf; and that he did not re­ceive any
 share from the proceeds of the robbery in Baybay on the night of 
February 21, 1972 because the robbers 'immediately fled away'. </p>
  <p>"In his last statement marked Exhibit "V", which was taken down by 
PC Sgt. Rodolfo Robles on February 28, 1972, Prado also recounted, among
 other things, that in the afternoon of February 13, 1972, he and the 
accused Domingo Borneo met the accused Boy Montemayor, one Rudy, and 
Carling in the public market of Baybay; that on February 15, 1972, he 
was instructed by Borneo to go to Ormoc City on February 17 to meet Boy 
Montemayor; that accordingly, he went to Ormoc City on February 17, 1972
 and there conferred with Boy Montemayor, one called Rudy, and Carling, 
who told him to inform Borneo that they were going to Baybay on February
 20 and that one Pedring of Cebu City and his com­panions would also be 
arriving in Baybay by pump-boat on February 21; that he transmitted the 
afore­said information and instructions of Boy Montema­yor to Borneo; 
that on February 20, 1972, he was requested by Borneo to look for 
ammunition for a carbine; that in the afternoon of February 21, 1972, 
while in Bo. Palhi, Baybay, he was able to buy six (6) rounds of bullets
 from Botoy Polo, which he immediately gave to Borneo; that Borneo 
forthwith went to the town proper of Baybay to see Boy Montemayor, Rudy,
 and Carling; that at about 5:00 o'clock that same afternoon, Borneo 
returned to Bo. Palhi and informed Prado that Boy Montemayor, Rudy, 
Carling, Constancio Gonzaga, Junior Paredes, Rogelio Bacus, Simo, 
Pedring, and their companions were already in the poblacion of Baybay; 
that he and Borneo went to the town proper on a motorcycle about 7:00 
o'clock that evening; that later that night, at about 9 to 10 o'clock, 
he was picked up by Patrolman Notarte and was brought to Mayor Loreto in
 order to identify the dead robber who was left behind in Baybay; and 
that he told them that he did not know the dead man." (At pp. 7-15.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Melchor Prado and Domingo Borneo interposed the defense of alibi.

</p><p>Melchor Prado, with Rustico de la Cruz as a corroborating 
witness, disclaimed participation in the mass robbery.  He said that 
from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m. on February 21, 1972, he was in Pahi, a 
barrio in Baybay, Leyte, where he was taking bets as a <em>masyador </em>in the cockpit.

</p><p>Domingo Borneo, with Rosario Ciabo and Rustico de la Cruz as 
corroborating witnesses, likewise disclaimed participation in the 
robbery.  He said that he was acting as referee in the cockpit in Pahi 
from 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on February 21, 1972.  He said that after 
drinking tuba at a store he was told about a clash involving the 
Philippine Constabulary and the police so that he and Melchor Prado rode
 on a motorcycle to go to the poblacion but they did not reach it 
because they were advised not to proceed.

</p><p>The appellants claim that:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>"I.  THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HAVING ONE SALA HEAR THE ENTIRETY OF 
THE EVIDENCE OF THE CASE AND STILL ANOTHER SALA DECIDE THE CASE ON THE 
BASIS OF THE RECORDS OF THE CASE ALONE. </p>
  <p>"II.  THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DECLARING BOTH ACCUSED MELCHOR PRADO
 AND DOMINGO BORNEO GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME." 
(Brief, p. 1.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first assignment of error is devoid of merit for two reasons:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>(1) Judge Salas issued an Order dated November 20, 1972, wherein he
 inhibited himself and transferred the case to the Executive Judge in 
Tacloban City.  On November 23, 1972, counsels for accused Melchor Prado
 and Domingo Borneo gave their conformity to the Order by stating that 
they had decided not to ask for its reconsideration and asked instead 
that the record of the trial be transcribed and copies of the transcript
 be sent to the Executive Judge and also to counsels because the accused
 "are insolvent litigants." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 709-719.) The appellants are thus estopped from questioning the decision of Executive Judge Borromeo. </p>
  <p>(2) It is not unusual for a judge who did not try a case to decide 
it on the basis of the record for the trial judge might have died, 
re­signed, retired, transferred, etc.  And this Court has held: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The fact that the Judge who heard the evidence is not the one 
who rendered the judgment and that for that reason the latter did not 
have the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses during the
 trial but merely relied on the records of the case does not render the 
judgment erroneous." (<em>Co Tao vs. Court of Appeals</em>, 101 Phil. 188, 194 [1957].  See also <em>U.S. vs. Abreu, 30 Phil. 402</em> [1915].)
      
</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The second assignment of error deals with the appreciation of the 
evidence and involves principally the credibility of witnesses.

</p><p>Because Executive Judge Borromeo was not the one who tried the 
case, We cannot fall back on the principle that the factual findings of 
the trial court are generally binding because it was in a better 
position to examine the real evidence as well as to observe the demeanor
 of the witnesses while testifying in the case.  Nonetheless, We note 
that Judge Borromeo made a painstaking study of the record and wrote a 
comprehensive decision.

</p><p>The appellants have interposed, as above stated, the defense of 
alibi.  Accordingly, the only pertinent issue is whether or not the 
prosecution's evidence positively identified them and established their 
participation in the pillage perpetrated in the poblacion of Baybay, 
Leyte, on February 21, 1972.  The answer is in the affirmative on both 
counts.

</p><p>One of the principal witnesses for the prosecution was Sergeant 
Arsenio Lipar of the Philippine Constabulary.  The substance of his 
testimony has been given in the People's version of the facts quoted 
above and need not be reproduced here.  The appellants question the 
credibility of Sgt. Lipar; they claim "that, as demonstrated by the 
witness Sgt. Lipar at the Vital Store before the hearing court, it was 
physically impossible for said witness to have seen anyone inside the 
store." The burden of the appellants' argument is that the position of 
Lipar's head in relation to the place where they were said to be, it was
 physically impossible for Lipar to have seen them.  This argument is 
negated by the appellant's own sketch (Brief, p. 8) which shows that 
from Lipar's position it was possible for him to see the two who were 
inside the Vital Store through its open door.  Thus Lipar testified in 
part as follows:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>"COURT: </p>
  <p>Let us go to the scene of the incident at Vital Store.
    
</p>
  <p>(SESSION AT THE COURT ROOM WAS TRANSFERRED AT THE SCENE OF THE 
INCIDENT.  THE HONORABLE PRESIDING JUDGE, THE ASSISTANT PROVINCIAL 
FISCAL, MARCIAL B. ESTELA, THE THREE (3) DEFENSE COUNSELS, ATTYS. 
TORRES, AUMENTADO AND FERNANDEZ, ALL THE ACCUSED AND WITNESSES, AND 
UNDERSIGNED STENOGRAPHER REPAIRED TO THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT, VITAL 
STORE, LOCATED AT THE CORNER OF A. BONIFACIO STREET AND MAGSAYSAY 
BOULEVARD, BAYBAY, LEYTE, WHERE SESSION WAS RESUMED).
    
</p>
  <p>COURT:  (To the witness)
    
</p>
  <p>Q  Where were you lying down at that time when the incident was committed?
    
</p>
  <p>A   I was lying down here (witness lying down face downwards on the sidewalk of the Vital Store along the Magsaysay Boulevard).
    
</p>
  <p>COURT:
    
</p>
  <p>Make if of record that as measured by Interpreter Polo the distance
 from the corner of Magsaysay Boulevard and A. Bonifacio Street to that 
part of the sidewalk where the feet of the witness, Sgt. Arsenio Lipa 
was said to have been situated, would measure a distance of four (4) 
meters and eight and one half (8-1/2) inches.
    
</p>
  <p>COURT:
    
</p>
  <p>Q  Now, Sgt. Lipar, how far was the head of Flores from your head?
    
</p>
  <p>A  About one foot.
    
</p>
  <p>Q  Now, which door was opened that time?
    
</p>
  <p>A  This door (witness referring to the door of the Vital Store 
along the Magsaysay Boulevard nearest the corner of A. Bonifacio Street 
and Magsaysay Boule­vard). </p>
  <p>COURT:
    
</p>
  <p>Make it of record that the witness pointed to the first door from 
the corner of both streets, the first door along the side of Magsaysay 
Boulevard.
    
</p>
  <p>Q  Now, where were the piles of cartons?
    
</p>
  <p>A  About a meter from the step of the door.
    
</p>
  <p>COURT:
    
</p>
  <p>Fiscal Estela, do you have any questions?
    
</p>
  <p>FISCAL ESTELA:
    
</p>
  <p>Yes, Your Honor.
    
</p>
  <p>Q   Where was Domingo Borneo when you saw him?
    
</p>
  <p>A    He was near the door bordering A. Bonifacio Street, about one 
(1) meter and thirty (30) inches from the door along A. Bonifacio 
Street.
    
</p>
  <p>Q   Melchor Prado, where was he when you saw him?
    
</p>
  <p>A    He was inside towards the door of A. Bonifacio Street.
    
</p>
  <p>Q   You said that you were standing.  These two (2) people you mentioned, where were their backs facing?
    
</p>
  <p>A    They were facing north.
    
</p>
  <p>Q   All right, for our clarification, we will bother you by 
illustrating before us how you were made to lie flat towards the 
pavement, and in a fleeting moment you saw both accused, Borneo and 
Prado?
    
</p>
  <p>A    I was lying this way (the witness was lying on his belly flat 
on the cement floor, while his two (2) arms were bent at right angle to 
the north, and the head was turned towards the left facing the inside of
 the Vital Store." (TSN, Arra­daza, pp. 138-140.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The credibility of Sgt. Lipar is further assailed by the circumstance
 that when he executed a sworn statement on February 23, 1972, two days 
after the pillage, said statement "is bereft by any identification of 
any of the malefactors, least of all, of the two herein appellants." 
(Brief, p. 11.) But the court <em>a quo </em>correctly observed:

</p><p>"In this connection, the Court has gone over the contents of 
Lipar's first sworn statement (Exh. "X-2") and it would appear therefrom
 that the investigator concentrated his interrogation on identification 
of those who surprised Lipar at the PC Detachment so that this may be 
the reason why the latter could have missed to mention accused Borneo 
and Prado during said investigation.  It should, precisely, be taken 
into account, that, as observed by the Court of Appeals, as a general 
rule, ‘evidence taken on an affidavit is incomplete and often inaccurate
 for want of suggestion or inquiry which would impel the witness to 
recall all the facts.’ (People vs. Panimbagan Dimdim, 50 O. G. No. 1, p.
 252, January, 1954, CA)." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 935-936.)

</p><p>When Lipar was again questioned on February 25, 1972, he 
mentioned names because his attention was so directed.  Thus he said in 
part:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Q   I have also noted in your answer to Question No. 7 in the last
 portion that the robbers had ordered you to lie flat besides the Vital 
Store and was further told not to look around, do you mean to say that 
all the time since you have lied flat besides the Vital Store you have 
only stayed or have remained in such position up to the time that you 
and your com­panions were left behind by the robbers? </p>
  <p>A     I have not stayed to only one position all the time.  I was 
able to turn around my head when the robbers went inside the Vital Store
 and robbed the said store.
    
</p>
  <p>Q    When you were able to turn your head, what have you noticed or have seen?
    
</p>
  <p>A     I was able to see, Melchor Prado, Domingo Borneo, with the 
robbers of no less than fifteen (15) persons whom I can only recognize 
them by their faces, except Melchor Prado and Domingo Borneo who are 
already known to me." (Exh. X-3, <em>Id.,</em> p. 22.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should also be mentioned that according to Lipar when his first 
statement was taken he was lying in bed because of pains all over his 
body caused by the maltreatment he received from the robbers and as a 
result of which he was not mentally alert and the matter of having seen 
Melchor Prado and Domingo Borneo escaped his mind.  (TSN, Arradaza, p. 
115.)

</p><p>The appellants state that the other prosecution witnesses did not
 point them out as among the brigands.  This statement is true but it 
must be recalled that the appellants were at the Vital Store whereas the
 witnesses, except for Uy Pho Ho, were elsewhere.  Mr. Ho's failure to 
identify the appellants may be attributed to the tension and excitement 
of the moment or to the well-known passivity and inscrutability of 
Chinese nationals.  The fact that the case had become a <em>cause celebre</em>
 must also be considered and for which reason Judge Salas had to inhibit
 himself so that Mr. Ho perhaps felt that he could do no less.

</p><p>Melchor Prado, whose death sentence is under review, executed 
three statements:  Exhibits T, U and V.  Their contents have been 
summarized in the People's version of the facts, <em>supra</em>, and in the decision of the court a quo, pages 940-947 of the <em>Expediente</em>.

</p><p>Prado now contends that his three extra-judicial statements were not voluntary.  This claim is made under the rubric "<em>Manner of subscription of oaths of sworn statements of Melchor Prado</em>"
 but the reasons therefor are not readily perceived; they seem to be 
based on alleged non-compliance with Circular No. 83 of the Department 
of Justice which the undersigned who was then Secretary of Justice 
issued on May 9, 1972, or long after the statements were made.  The 
circular states, among other things, that when a sworn statement or 
confession of suspects is taken, the suspect should be informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.
  That Prado was so informed is not stated in his three sworn statements
 but it should be noted that when they were taken neither Circular No. 
83 nor <em>Miranda </em>as embodied in the Constitution was in force and
 could not have rendered inadmissible the statements which must be 
presumed to have been made voluntarily.

</p><p>That Prado's statements were voluntary and made without maltreatment or threats is attested by the following:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>(1) Zenen A. Puray, Municipal Judge of Baybay, Leyte, who 
administered the oaths to Prado, testified that he read the contents of 
the affidavits and asked if they were true and correct and Prado 
answered in the affirmative.
    
</p>
  <p>(2) Prado admitted that he "did not complain anymore before Judge 
Puray" but claimed that the reason was "because they [Sgts. Pascual and 
Lipar of the PC] warned me if I will make any complaint I will be mauled
 again." (TSN, Rodriguez, p. 323.) </p>
  <p>(3) Philippine Constabulary personnel who were involved in taking 
the statements said that they were voluntarily signed and denied that 
Prado was maltreated.
    
</p>
  <p>(4) As the court <em>a quo </em>observed:
    
</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Analyzing carefully the above-reproduced contents of accused 
Prado's sworn statements, the Court is of the view that it should brush 
aside accused Prado's disclaimer of their having been voluntarily given 
by him for it is inconceivable that such kind of lengthy and detailed 
answers as are found in the statements could have been ex­tracted by 
force or violence or that they were simply the concoctions or inventions
 of the PC investigators." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 947-948.) </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The appellants also argue that two identifying witnesses - Sgt. Arsenio Lipar and Mrs. Antonieta Salvacion - had PC connections.

</p><p>Mrs. Salvacion's husband was a member of the PC when the incident
 happened.  She identified Lope Daigan and Policronio Escalante who were
 acquitted by the court a quo.  For this reason it is not necessary to 
deal with her testimony.

</p><p>As to Sgt. Lipar, he identified the two appellants.  The 
substance of his testimony has been stated above and appraised as well. 
 The fact that Sgt. Lipar was a member of the PC did not disqualify him 
as a witness.  Precisely, he was qualified to be a witness not only 
because he was a law enforcement officer but also because he himself was
 a victim of the crime.  It is to be noted in this connection that the 
appellants have not shown that Sgt. Lipar was motivated by improper 
considerations when he testified against them.

</p><p>The testimony of prosecution witness Ambrosio Polo is questioned.  The court <em>a quo </em>considered
 him a minor witness and mentioned his testimony in one sentence as 
follows:  "Ambrosio Polo, a 35-year old jobless person, who confirmed 
the statement in his affidavit (Exh, "W") that accused Melchor Prado was
 im­plicated in the robbery of the 'Rosario A' and is a gambler and 
jobless;" (<em>Id.,</em> p. 915.)

</p><p>Indeed Polo was a mere corroborative witness and his testimony could be discarded without materially altering the result.

</p><p>The testimony of Lt. Virgilio Olan of the PC is also questioned. 
 He was a victim of the robbery; he lost his gun, class ring, watch and 
money.  He admitted that while giving chase to the robbers Sgt. Lipar 
told him of Borneo's presence at the Vital Store.  The appellants pose 
this question:  during the investigation of Prado, why did Lt. Olan not 
bring up the presence of Borneo at the Vital Store?  His explanation was
 that he was conducting his own investigation but which was interrupted 
because he had to go to Cebu.

</p><p>Finally, the appellants claim that their behavior prior to their 
apprehension shows their innocence; they point to the fact that they did
 not flee Baybay after the robbery.  True it is that a circumstance such
 as this is a factor in determining guilt or innocence but it is not 
decisive and must be considered with other evidence.  In this case, the 
evidence points to the guilt of the ap­pellants; their alibi must fail 
because they were identified to have been at the scene of the crime and 
they did not demonstrate that it was impossible for them to have been 
there at the time of its commission.

</p><p>The court <em>a quo </em>concluded that aggravating circumstances were present and We agree; it said:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Considering that the evidence presented in this case has clearly 
established the fact that, before the commercial establishments of 
Baybay were simultaneously robbed on the evening in question, and, at 
that time, there was no electricity in Baybay because the electric power
 plant was then destroyed by the typhoon, the malefactors, all armed and
 they were between fifteen (15) to twenty (20) in number, first disarmed
 or rendered helpless the PC Detachment and the municipal police force 
of said municipality obviously to prevent any hindrance in the 
accomplishment of their criminal design, the Court thinks that there 
existed in the commission of the offense involved in this case the 
aggravating circumstances of the crime having been committed:  (1) in 
contempt of or with insult to the public authorities; (2) by a band; and
 (3) by taking advantage of the nighttime to facilitate commission 
thereof." (<em>Id.,</em> pp. 955-956.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, the judgment of the court <em>a quo </em>convicting the 
appellants of the crime of robbery in band with homicide is affirmed but
 modified with respect to the penalty of Melchor Prado who is sentenced 
to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em> only because of the lack of 
necessary votes to impose the death penalty.  The indemnity to be paid 
to the heirs of Domiciana Castro shall be P30,000.00.  Costs against the
 appellants.

</p><p>SO ORDERED.

</p><p><em>Makasiar, Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Escolin, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr., De La Fuente</em>, and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.

</p><p><em>Fernando, C.J.</em>, on official leave.
