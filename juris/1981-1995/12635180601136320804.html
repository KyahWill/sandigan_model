				<BR><STRONG>RELOVA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Automatic review of a decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao (Criminal Case Mo. 9411) finding appellant Narciso Villaver guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide and sentencing him to the extreme penalty of death due to the presence of "the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation and the deliberate intent to his own legitimate daughter based on immoral and highly contemptible motive, and with no mitigating circumstance to offset the same." <p>Appellant Narciso Villaver has eight (8) children by his wife. One of his children was his now deceased daughter, Francisca Villaver, the herein victim.</p> <p>Francisca Villaver was, in the morning of September 24, 1965, with a group of eight (8) persons, including her father, the herein appellant, and one Genara Sordillo. They went to the beach to take a bath and to gather shells. After lunch, appellant brought his daughter Francisca to a mangrove swamp, about 50 meters away from the seashore. After a few minutes, Francisca was seen running back from the mangrove in an uneasy appearance, her dress torn on the left side, and she confided to Genara that her father, the herein appellant, wanted and tried to abuse her.</p> <p>That night, at about seven o'clock, appellant forced Francisca to swallow and drink "Endrin", a liquid used for killing worms in the ricefield. Appellant grabbed Francisca by the hair with one hand and with the other, forced her mouth to open and poured the poison into her mouth.</p> <p>The incident was witnessed by Remedios Villaver, a younger sister of the victim. Her mother was in the other room, nursing her baby. The other children were not present.</p> <p>Francisca was rushed by her mother to a hospital where emergency treatment was applied. Notwithstanding, she died after 25 minutes from arrival.</p> <p>Cause of death is chemical poisoning.</p> <p>Appellant denied the charge against him and claimed that about 6:30 in the evening of September 24, 1965, after the family had taken supper, Francisca went up the sala of the house and there he saw her drinking the contents of a bottle which he knew was "Endrin", a poisonous substance which could cause death. He tried to grab the bottle but it was too late. After having drunk the contents of the bottle, Francisca jumped out of the window and ran towards the ricefield. He gave chase but failed to find her. After a futile search for about half an hour, he returned home to attend to a crying baby. Few hours thereafter, the police came and placed him under arrest. He was in the municipal jail when late that night someone told him that his daughter Francisca died at the hospital.</p> <p>Appealing to this Court, appellant alleged that the lower court erred (1) in giving full credence to the testimony of Remedios Villaver and in convicting him on the basis thereof; (2) in finding that he committed the crime charged; and, (3) in convicting him of the crime of parricide, instead of acquitting him.</p> <p>In this appeal, appellant would want the court to believe that his daughter Francisca voluntarily drunk "Endrin" despite his attempt to prevent her from taking such liquid.</p> <p>We cannot give assent to this defense considering the testimony of appellant's minor daughter, Remedios Villaver, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Will you kindly relate to this Honorable Court what happened on the evening of September 24, 1965?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>That night my elder sister was poisoned by my father.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Can you tell the Court how your father poisoned your elder sister?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>He made her drink 'Endrin.'</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">How did your father make your sister drink "Endrin?' . . .

The claim that Remedios committed inconsistencies in her testimony is understandable considering her age (she was sixteen when she was on the witness stand). But, the fact is, she was present when the incident occurred and she stoodfast in her testimony that her father forced her sister to drink the poisonous liquid.</p> <p>Further, there is the testimony of Genara Sordillo that from the house of the appellant she heard Remedios shouting for help; that not long afterwards, Remedios, with her two brothers, arrived in her (Genara's) house crying and telling her that Francisca was made to drink "Endrin" by the appellant.</p> <p>The claim of the defense that Genara Sordillo had ulterior motive in testifying against the appellant because of their incident concerning the use of irrigation water is not enough; for, even assuming that to be true, the same cannot be sufficient motivation for one to testify falsely against another of a very serious crime. In fact, appellant admitted that Genara went outing with Francisca that morning and this gives lie to the alleged bad blood existing between Genara and appellant's family. Hereunder is the testimony of appellant on this point.</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">According to this Genara Sordillo she said that in the morning of September 24, 1965 you and your daughter went with them to Aplaya, Guihing at Hagonoy, is that correct?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">My daughter went with Genara to Aplaya but I did not go with them.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">You mean to tell the Court that you did not go with Genara and your daughter that morning of September 24, 1965?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>No, sir.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">And who was the companion of your daughter if any that went with Genara that morning.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">What I know is it is only Genara and my daughter who went to take a bath in the sea.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">According to the testimony of Genara, that morning of September 24, 1965, you tried to abuse your daughter, Francisca, what do you say to this?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">I could not say anything to that because I was not there, I have not done anything like that." (TSN, pp. 111-112, November 2, 1966 hearing)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote> <p>Finally, there is the testimony of Police Corporal Ildefonso Bermudo that when he apprehended appellant, the latter readily admitted having poisoned his daughter because of her disobedience. In fact, he pointed to the bottle of Endrin which was used by him.</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">What did you do upon knowing that Francisca Villaver was poisoned by her father?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">As operations officer I immediately rushed to the house of Villaver together with PFC Saraom.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>What did you do in the house of Narciso Villaver?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>My purpose was to apprehend Narciso Villaver.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>Were you able to reach the house of Narciso Villaver?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>Yes, sir.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>Did you find him there?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>Yes, sir.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> <div align="center">. . .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. . .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. . .</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>Did he give any answer?</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;A</td> <td>Yes, mam.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Q</td> <td>What did he say?</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">He answered that it is true he poisoned his daughter.

(TSN, pp. 92-93, November 2, 1966 hearing)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote> <p>However, we agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that the crime was not committed with evident premeditation and with immoral motive. "The evidence adduced does not support the existence of evident premeditation. The second circumstance, while it may find support in the evidence (pp. 5-6, 57-58, id.), though hearsay in nature, same may not be considered as it does not fall under any of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in Art. 14 of the Revised Penal Code. Unlike mitigating circumstances (Art. 13, par. [10], R.P.C.), there is no such thing as similar nature and analogous to those . . . mentioned as aggravating circumstances."</p> <p><strong>ACCORDINGLY</strong>, We find the accused appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide, with the modification that the penalty is reduced to <em>Reclusion Perpetua</em>, there being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstances attendant to the commission thereof. With costs against the appellant.</p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p> <p><em>Fernando, C.J., Teehankee, Makasiar, Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro, Escolin, Vasquez,</em> and <em>Gutierrez, Jr., JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Concepcion Jr., J.,</em> for the death penalty.<br><em>Melencio-Herrera, J.,</em> concurs with Justice Plana.<br><em>Plana, J.,</em> votes to affirm the death penalty there being one aggravating circumstance—use of poison (RPC, Art. 14, par. 12).<br><em>Aquino, J.,</em> is on leave.</p></div>
