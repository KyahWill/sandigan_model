However, only herein accused was arraigned, and pleaded not guilty, since
Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> was not apprehended and has since
remained at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, appellant was found guilty and sentenced to serve
the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was further ordered to pay the heirs of
the deceased the amount of P16,628.40 representing hospital bills, expenses for
the coffin, tomb, wake and attorney's fees, and P30,000.00 as indemnity for the
death of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">antecedental</span> facts which led to the
filing of the criminal action below are <span class="SpellE">hereinunder</span>
set forth as synthesized by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> from the testimonies

and as clarified and amplified by us from the transcripts of the notes of the
hearings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1983</st1:date>,
in the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> aforementioned, a certain Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> was accosted by appellant near the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> hall for allegedly circulating the rumor that
appellant and his companions were engaged in stealing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon confrontation, appellant boxed <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> which caused the latter to fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>, who was then present at the scene, approached and
helped the fallen <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> and pushed appellant
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This apparently angered appellant
who, in his native dialect said, "<span class="SpellE">Andam</span> ka <span class="SpellE">lang</span> <span class="SpellE">Inday</span> <span class="SpellE">kay</span>
<span class="SpellE">patyon</span> <span class="SpellE">ta</span> <span class="SpellE">guid</span>," ("Watch out <span class="SpellE">Inday</span>
for I will kill you") to which <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>
retorted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Just do it."</p>

<p class="BODY">Two days later, or on September 17, 1983, at about 8:00 o'clock
P.M., appellant and his cousin, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>,
were drinking <span class="SpellE">softdrinks</span> at the store of Gloria <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> when <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> passed
by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, appellant and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> left their <span class="SpellE">softdrinks</span>
half-consumed and followed <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Longno</span> eventually reached the bench
near the public faucet where the group of <span class="SpellE">Massulini</span> <span class="SpellE">Dullete</span>, Samuel <span class="SpellE">Canoso</span> and
Nathaniel Ramos were sitting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He joined
the group in their conversation by saying, "<span class="SpellE">Upod</span>
<span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">dira</span>," ("I'll
go with what you say.").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
thereafter, appellant and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> arrived and
appellant accosted and pointed a gun at <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>,
saying, "<span class="SpellE">Maano</span> ka?" ("What are you
going to do?").<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Longno</span>
then faced appellant and said, "<span class="SpellE">Brod</span>, <span class="SpellE">tiruha</span> lang." ("<span class="SpellE">Brod</span>,
just shoot.")</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently irked by the response, appellant fired the gun,
hitting <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> in the left forearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dullete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Canoso</span> and Ramos then scampered for safety as appellant and
the wounded <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> grappled for the gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was while the two were thus struggling
that <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>
in the chest, after which both appellant and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>
ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Longno</span> then came out of the <span class="SpellE">footwalk</span> shouting, "<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tay</span></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">tiniro</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Insik</span>, <span class="SpellE">binuno</span>
<span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> Toto."
("Father, I was shot by <span class="SpellE">Insik</span> and stabbed by
Toto.").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able to run about
thirty (30) meters before he fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
father, Julio <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>, ran to his son who was then
lying sprawled on ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rushed to the <st1:city><st1:place>St.
  Paul</st1:place></st1:city>'s Hospital, <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later,
it was established that the cause of death was hemorrhage, secondary to stab
wound.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's version of the incident, however, differs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admits having shot <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>
but pleads self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that
on <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1983</st1:date>, he
left the house of his father-in-law at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00
 o'clock P.M.</st1:time> with his cousin, <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter had asked for help to have a .22
caliber revolver repaired and appellant was taking the revolver to a policeman
friend of his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way, appellant
saw <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> from a distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his approach, <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>
allegedly said, "<span class="SpellE">Insik</span>, I heard that you are not
afraid of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe you want to be
taught a lesson."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant claims that the deceased had a revolver tucked in his
waist and was about to draw the same. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He, therefore, parried the gun but it fired
hitting one of appellant's left fingers which was later amputated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that appellant pulled out his gun
and shot <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> in the forearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant and <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>
afterwards grappled for the gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> allegedly tried to separate appellant and <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> but he was brushed aside by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of their struggle, <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> then shouted to appellant, "I stabbed <span class="SpellE">Inday</span>, run," and so he and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>
ran away.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, in his brief, makes the following assignment of
errors:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The trial court erred in not acquitting the
accused-appellant for having acted in complete self-defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The trial court erred in convicting the
accused-appellant of the crime of murder and in imposing the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> when the prosecution has not
established by competent evidence the existence of conspiracy and the presence
of the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and abuse of superior
strength.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's version does not inspire credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-entrenched is the rule that where the
accused invokes self-defense, it is incumbent upon him to prove by clear and
convincing evidence that he indeed acted in defense of himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must rely on the strength of his own
evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, even if the prosecution evidence is
weak, it could not be disbelieved after the accused himself had admitted the
killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a statutory and doctrinal requirement that for the
justifying circumstance of self-defense, the presence of unlawful aggression is
a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no self-defense, complete or incomplete, unless the victim
has committed an unlawful aggression against the person defending himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the burden of evidence having been shifted,
we hold that the defense failed to establish the primary element of unlawful
aggression on the part of the victim and, therefore, the plea of self-defense
must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The narrations of the
sequence of events by the accused, and by the lone alleged eyewitness for the
defense, Jose <span class="SpellE">Randera</span>, are unconvincing primarily on
account of their inherent inconsistency and conflict with each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant on cross-examination testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How far were you
from <span class="SpellE">Inday</span> <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> when he
allegedly fired a shot at you?</blockquote>

that a pistol or a revolver? </blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because immediately
after he said those words 'Maybe you want to learn a lesson' he immediately
drew his gun and I was able to parry.</blockquote>

hitting you at the left palm?</blockquote>

much force the gun fell.</blockquote>

gun?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, defense eyewitness Jose <span class="SpellE">Randera</span>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> reveal an
inconsistency on the matter of the gun for which appellant and the victim
supposedly grappled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While appellant
claimed that the victim's weapon fell to the ground, witness <span class="SpellE">Randera</span> stated that appellant and the victim still grappled
for the latter's gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
statement is itself difficult to imagine since appellant at that precise moment
was also allegedly holding with his right hand the gun which he used in
shooting <span class="SpellE">Longno</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is necessary to stress that such inconsistency cannot be
considered a minor detail since the homogeneity of the answers to the inquiry
could very well have established the existence of not only a single gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had this prevarication not been exposed, said
testimonies could have bolstered the defense theory that the victim himself
carried a gun which he used to assault the appellant and thus establish the
element of unlawful aggression contrived by the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the credibility of witness <span class="SpellE">Randera</span>
is shattered by this finding of the trial court which is sustained by the
evidence:</p>

<blockquote>"The testimony of security guard Jose <span class="SpellE">Randera</span>
deserves scant consideration not only because he admitted that he was one of
those threatened by the deceased <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Longno</span> but also because he <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
falsified the truth when he testified that the deceased was shot and hit by the
accused on the body and that he saw blood come out just below the right breast
of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The physical evidence
in this case showed that there was no wound on the right breast of the deceased
nor on any part of his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gunshot
wound sustained by the deceased was only on his left forearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that he testified that there were
no other persons there during the incident except the accused, the deceased and
Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> when the overwhelming weight of
evidence is that there were a lot of other people during the incident (this)
showed that this witness had small regard for the truth."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Coming back to appellant's representations in court, his
vacillation as to what he allegedly did after <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>
stabbed the victim is another instance which renders his version highly
suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While stating on direct
examination that he ran to the main road,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span>he
claimed on cross-examination that he only walked a short distance and then went
to the hospital upon seeing that his hand was wounded.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The latter statement is itself inconsistent with his earlier declaration during
the same proceeding that he was brought by a policeman to the hospital.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This irresolution on the part of the appellant was obviously to avoid any
imputation of guilt against him arising from his flight.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is
further negated by the physical evidence in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, we quote the trial court with
approval:</p>

<blockquote>"The testimony of the accused Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Sazon</span>
that the deceased was armed with a gun and fired at him is not borne out by the
physical evidence in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
paraffin test conducted on the cadaver of the deceased showed that the hands of
the deceased were negative for gunpowder residues indicating that he did not
fire a gun during the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other parts of his body like his forearm and his abdomen bore strong traces of
gunpowder residues because of the burst of the gun of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court is convinced beyond reasonable
doubt that there was only one gun during the incident and that the gun belonged
to and/or was used by the accused Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Sazon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That apart of one of his fingers was blown
off at very close range, according to Dr. Ely <span class="SpellE">Canja</span>,
strongly indicated that the accused accidentally hit his finger when he and the
deceased grappled for the possession of the gun."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, appellant was found positive for the presence of
gunpowder residues (nitrates).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the
presence or absence of nitrates cannot indeed be considered conclusive proof
that one has or has not fired a gun, the following testimony on direct

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, <span class="SpellE">Sinfuego</span> further
testified as follows: </p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
it possible for a person who has not fired a firearm and could be (sic)
positive for nitrates?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

from the fertilizer.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, Sir but we have to

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And this (sic) nitrates

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it is true that the bad moral character of the
offended party may be proven in evidence to establish in any reasonable degree
the probability of the offense charged,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
e.g., the quarrelsome nature of the victim may tend to establish that he
started the unlawful aggression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, such evidence, seeking to establish as it does only a
probability, cannot prevail over facts sufficiently proven by the prosecution
during the trial belying such aggression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These observations find application in the instant case where the
defense presented and now argue on character evidence consisting of criminal
charges involving minor offenses which had been filed against the deceased, but
not one of which resulted in conviction and were in fact dismissed, except for
one case which was sent to the archives.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, whether or not appellant acted in self-defense is
essentially a question of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being so
and in the absence of any showing that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> failed to
appreciate facts or circumstances of weight and substance that would have
altered its conclusion, the court below, having seen and heard the witnesses
during the trial, is in a better position to evaluate their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No compelling reason, therefore, lies for
this Court to disturb the trial court's finding that appellant did not act in
self-defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, however, holds that appellant, albeit guilty, can only
be convicted of homicide and not murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court correctly held that the killing was not accompanied by
treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, however, ruled that there
was evident premeditation on the part of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the records sorely wanting in
evidence to support the latter conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that appellant told the deceased that he would kill him
and that two days later, after the deceased passed by the store where appellant
and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> were drinking <span class="SpellE">softdrinks</span>
the latter followed the former and inflicted the fatal blows, cannot adequately
sustain a conclusion of premeditated killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">To justify its attendance, the prosecution must prove (1) the
time when the offender determined to commit the crime, (2) an act manifestly
indicating that the culprit has clung to his determination, and (3) a
sufficient lapse of time between the determination and the execution to allow
him to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the first and second elements are
lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The angry outburst of appellant
in that incident of <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1983</st1:date>,
warning the victim that the former would kill him, does not convince us that,
under the circumstances therein, appellant as of that time had already decided
to kill the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A homicidal
premeditation is studiedly conceived and not impulsively adopted just like that
and, worse, publicly announced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
more of a spontaneous expression of resentment or bravado on the part of
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the circumstance that appellant and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>
were by chance at the store when the victim passed by cannot be taken as
manifestly indicating that appellant had clung to his determination to kill the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was presented to
show that appellant purposely waited there for the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there any showing that the deceased
frequently passed by the same route as to warrant and explain appellant's
waiting for the former at that place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, that the meeting may have been purely accidental is not a remote
possibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are more inclined to
believe that it was the belligerent and defiant demeanor of the victim when
confronted by appellant near the public faucet that precipitated the assault.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under such considerations and there being no other evidence to
prove that the death of the victim was the result of meditation, calculation or
reflection, evident premeditation cannot be appreciated to qualify the killing
to murder.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The circumstances qualifying or aggravating the act must be proved in an
evident and incontestable manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
must be proved as conclusively as the acts constituting the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, for the same reason, the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior
strength cannot be appreciated in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Superior strength may aggravate or qualify a crime, only if it is
clearly shown that there was deliberate intent to take advantage of it.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of any evidence to show that the accused purposely sought to use
their superior strength to their advantage in the present case, a finding to
that effect by the trial court cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the fact that appellant did not inflict the mortal wound
upon the deceased is of no moment, since the existence of conspiracy was
satisfactorily shown by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The coordinated acts of appellant and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>
of immediately following the victim and jointly confronting him thereafter
reveal a concordance and unity of thought which resulted in the encounter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances that after the accused shot
the victim in the forearm and, while he and the victim were grappling for
appellant's gun, <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> stabbed the victim to death,
indicate closeness and coordination of their action geared towards a common
purpose, that is, to kill the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Proof of a previous agreement to commit the crime is not absolutely essential
to establish a conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
sufficient that the accused be shown to have acted in concert pursuant to the
same objective,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
as such circumstance is invariably indicative of a conspiratorial agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">It bears mention, at this point, that while we have ruled out
evident premeditation in the case, this does not negate the existence of a
conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, conspiracy generally
involves evident premeditation, but this circumstance requires for its <u>raison</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>d'etre</u></span> a sufficient time in a juridical sense
for the accused to meditate and reflect on the consequences of his intended
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such time element is not an
indispensable requirement for a conspiracy to exist.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, we find that there was a conspiracy between appellant and <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span> although, for lack of conclusive showing, we cannot
consider evident premeditation against appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that where a conspiracy is proven, a showing as to
who inflicted the fatal wound is not required to sustain a conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
The act of one in killing the victim becomes the act of all the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Altejos</span>
is concerned, however, the trial court never acquired jurisdiction over him and
he can neither be convicted nor exculpated herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>References in this judgment to him are,
therefore, <u>obiter</u> and with no binding effect on him.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the trial court is
MODIFIED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused–appellant Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Sazon</span> is declared GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the
