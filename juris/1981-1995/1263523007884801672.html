This is a petition to review the Order of the defunct Court of First 
Instance of Rizal in LRC Case No. C-1459.

Carminia Siochi is the registered owner of a piece of land situated in 
Malabon, Rizal, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 212043 of 
the Registry of Deeds for Rizal.  The land was formerly a part of the 
Tambobong Estate which was acquired by the government in 1947 pursuant 
to Commonwealth Act No. 539.  The law authorized the President of the 
Philippines to subdivide the estate into home lots "for resale at 
reasonable prices and under such conditions as he may fix." (Sec. 1.)
<p>
Siochi's transfer certificate of title contains the following restrictions:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “1.  That it shall not be sold, assigned, encumbered, mortgaged or
 transferred within the period of five (5) years from the date hereof 
with­out first obtaining the written consent of the Se­cretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources; </p>
  <p> “2.  That except by hereditary succession, it shall not be 
conveyed, transferred or assigned in favor of any person who is not 
landless and disqualified to acquire or own land in the Philippines; </p>
  <p> "3.  That violation of either of the next two preceding paragraphs
 shall be sufficient ground for the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
 Resources or his duly authorized representative to take such action as 
may be necessary for the reversion of the land to the government."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In a petition dated November 13, 1973, Siochi asked the court <em>a quo</em> to cancel the restrictions "inasmuch as the period of five (5) years has already expired."
</p><p>
The petition was partly opposed by the then Department of Agrarian 
Reform in representation of the Government of the Philippines; it did 
not object to the cancellation of restriction No. 1 "for the reason that
 the period of five (5) years therein stated had already prescribed; it 
however interposes vigorous opposition to the cancellation of conditions
 nos. 2 and 3."
</p><p>
The court <em>a quo</em> granted the petition; it ordered the 
cancella­tion of the restrictions annotated on TCT No. 212043.  In 
granting the petition, the court said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Upon a mature deliberation of the two (2) opposing contentions, 
the court is inclined to agree with the contentions of the petitioner 
that the annotations at the back of the title No. 212043 covering Lot 
No. 16, Block 5, be cancelled.  To perpetuate the annotations of 
encumbrances at the back as the oppositor would like the Court to do 
would be in effect a restraint of ownership which is in violation of 
law, particularly Art. 428 of the Civil Code. </p>
  <p>
  'Art. 428. The owner has the right to enjoy and dispose of a thing 
without any other limitation than those established by law.'
  </p>
  <p> "If the encumbrance at the back is allowed to be a perpetual 
provision for the owner to dispose such property, it will be in 
violation of said article.  The Court holds that the limitation embodied
 in 1, 2 and 3 is only for a period of five (5) years and the five (5) 
years had elapsed since those encumbrances were annotated on January 10,
 1968.  The intention of law as envisioned in Commonwealth Act 539, 
could not have meant a perpetual limitation of right of ownership to a 
deserving awardee, because if that was the intention, the law would have
 clearly made it so." (<em>Rollo</em>, pp. 54-55.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The oppositor has elevated the case to this Court for review in a petition for certiorari filed on August 14, 1974.
</p><p>
To use a favorite expression of Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, the 
petition is highly impressed with merit because in a decision penned by 
Justice Juvenal K. Guerrero and promulgated as recently as August 17, 
1981, in a case on all fours with this one, the Court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Conditions No. (2) and (3) are found or provided in Section 17 
and 18 of Land Registration Order No. R-3 under the subject 'Rules and 
Regulations Governing the Acquisition and Disposition of Landed Estate,'
 approved November 15, 1951 by the Secretary of Agri­culture and Natural
 Resources.  These sections pro­vide as follows: </p>
  <p>
    '16.  Prohibition to Alienate. - The applicant shall not sell, 
assign, encumber, mortgage or transfer, his rights under the agreement 
to sell or in the property subject thereof without first obtaining the 
written consent of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources 
and this condition shall subsist until the lapse of five (5) years from 
the date of the execution of the final deed of sale in his favor and 
shall be annotated as an encumbrance on the certificate of title of the 
property that may be issued in his favor.
  </p>
  <p> '17.  Conveyance of Lands, Covered by Final Deeds of Sale. - 
Except by hereditary succession, no lands acquired hereunder shall be 
transferred or assigned to any in­dividual unless he be landless and not
 other­wise disqualified from acquiring and owning lands in the 
Philippines.  This prohibition shall be made a condition in all deeds of
 sale and shall be annotated as encumbrance in the certificate of title.
 </p>
  <p> '18.  Violation of the two preceding paragraphs:  its effect. - 
Any sale, assignment, encumbrance, mortgage, or transfer made in 
violation of the pro­visions to the next two preceding paragraphs hereof
 is null and void, and shall be suffi­cient ground for the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources to cancel the deed of sale and to 
order the reversion of the land to the government and the forfeiture of 
whatever payments made on account thereof.  In case, however, a deed of 
sale has already been issued, the violation of the said pro­visions 
shall be sufficient ground for the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources to take appropriate action in court with a view to obtaining 
the reversion of the land involved to the government.  All lands 
reverted to the government shall be disposed of as vacant lot.' </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         xxx                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               xxx
  </p>
  <p> "Conditions Nos. 2 and 3, having been imposed pursuant to an 
Administrative Order which has the force and effect of the law, are 
therefore binding upon any person who acquires title to the same, it 
appearing that said Conditions are annotated as encumbrances on the back
 of the Certificate of Title of the land.  Moreover, the said Conditions
 are not contrary to law, morals, customs, or public policy.  In fact, 
these Conditions had been im­posed inorder to implement more effectively
 the main purpose of the constitutional provision which is to break up 
landed estates into reasona­bly small portions and to discourage the 
con­centration of excessive landed wealth in an entity or a few 
individuals.  (Republic vs. Baylosis, 96 Phil. 461) Incidentally, the 
New Constitution of 1973 provided a modification of the original 
provision in the 1935 Constitution, thus:  'The National Assembly may 
authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of 
private lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to 
deserving citizens.'" (De Gallego vs. Land Authority, L-26848, August 
17, 1981, 106 SCRA 598, 604-606.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby granted; the Order of the court <em>a quo</em> is set aside insofar as it orders the cancel­lation of restrictions Nos. 2 and 3.  Costs against the respondent.
SO ORDERED.
