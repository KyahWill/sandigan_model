<p class="BODY">After respondent <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> submitted his
comment, the case was referred to Executive Judge Antonio Padua <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> of the city court of Manila for investigation,
report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due
investigation, Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> found respondent to have
committed "grave misconduct coupled with gross negligence, and to have
failed to comply with the mandates of the warrant for the seizure of personal
property in Civil Case No. 044361, entitled:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Commercial Credit Corporation of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
plaintiff, vs. Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, et al., defendants'
issued by Judge Archimedes C. de Guzman of Branch VIII of the City Court of
Manila, as provided in Sections 3, <span style="">4

strongly recommends respondent's dismissal from service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In her complaint, <span class="SpellE">Nene</span> <span class="SpellE">Tordesillas</span> alleged:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1980</st1:date>, at or about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time>
in the morning <span class="GramE">while</span> my car, a Mercedes Benz 1968
Model, bearing Plate No. L-HG-841, was parked in front of the Philippine
Christian College, certain persons who were later identified as <span class="SpellE">Humberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> together with
other several persons, conspiring and confederating with one another, forcibly
and illegally broke open the hood and doors of my car and then drove it away
after forcing and breaking likewise the ignition switch <span style="">lock and the steering wheel lock of said car;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as a result of such unlawful and illegal
acts, I<span style=""> </span>lost among other things

bottles of perfumes, price P450.00; clothing materials valued at P300.00; and
many others, which designation thereof shall be accordingly identified;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the above incident happened along General
<span class="SpellE">Malvar</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>, Manila,
in front of the Philippine Christian College."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="3"><span style="">March 3,
 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> submitted the following explanation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 8, 1980, under and by virtue of the
Warrant of Seizure issued in Civil Case No.044361, City Court of Manila, Br.
VIII, entitled 'Commercial Credit Corporation vs. Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
Edward <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and John Doe (copy whereof attached as
Annex I hereof) I effected the seizure of a motor vehicle, Mercedes Benz,
object thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief self-explanatory account of my
seizure proceedings is contained in the Sheriff's Return dated <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1980</st1:date> (copy whereof attached
as Annex 2 hereof);</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The</span> complained
seizure is a justifiable regular and obligatory act directed by and under the
Court order (Annex 1) and undertaken by the plaintiff's representatives, agents
and counsel with my assistance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, defendant Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
herself assisted or otherwise was instrumental in the location, identification
and seizure of the car;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The forcible taking of the object motor
vehicle is a necessary and/or incidental act of the seizure proceedings, and
which is grounded on a provision of law:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rule 135, Sec. 6, Rules of Court - 'When by law <span style="">jurisdiction is conferred on a court or judicial officer, all auxiliary
writs, processes and other means necessary to carry it into effect may be
employed by such court or officer; and if the procedure to be followed in the
exercise of such jurisdiction is not specifically pointed out by law or by
these rules, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be adopted which
appears conformable to the spirit of said law or rules;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the itemized articles allegedly lost
(paragraph 2 of the complaint) I deny having a part and liability therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I did not see these articles within
or inside the object motor vehicle prior to and after the seizure thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant <span class="SpellE">TORDESILLAS</span>
is making a sweeping generalization of the alleged losses without evidence and
with a prejudiced view;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seized motor vehicle has been viewed and
inspected by the Honorable Judge Archimedes C. de Guzman who issued the Seizure
Order, and con­tinues in Sheriff's custody pending resolution and determination
of legal matters brought up by the parties in Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of all foregoing, I hereby submit that the complaint
of <span class="SpellE">NENA</span> <span class="SpellE">TORDESILLAS</span> be
dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Executive
Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, in his report, finds the vehicle
seized to be different from the one described in the warrant of seizure of
personal property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The property seized
bore the following descriptions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Make:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One (1) Mercedes Benz</blockquote>

<blockquote>Model:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1967</blockquote>

<blockquote>Type:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4 <span class="GramE">door</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Motor No.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>121 940 10 032499</blockquote>

<blockquote>Serial No.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>11001050</blockquote>

<blockquote>File No.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4G 10724</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plate No.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>L - FW 899."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
motor vehicle described in the warrant was:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Make:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mercedes Benz</blockquote>

<blockquote>Model:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1968</blockquote>

<blockquote>Type:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4 - door sedan</blockquote>

<blockquote>Motor No.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>121-940-10-060753</blockquote>

<blockquote>File No.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4G-13058</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plate No.:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>L-HG-841."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> reports that ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The patent dissimilarity of the plate
numbers alone was more than enough to cause respondent to exercise extreme care
and caution in implementing the warrant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he testified that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the plate
number was not important to him, he could not remember if they were the same,
his interest was not in the plate number which could be changed any time, the
body number was no longer necessary, and the serial number and filing number
were the same as indicated in the warrant and as told to him by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, plaintiff's counsel, and he <span style="">believed her (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., March 27, 1981, p. 19).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Sections 3 and 4, Rule 60, of the Rules of Court, it is
the personal duty and responsibility of respondent to implement the
warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in paragraph No. 3 of his reply
to complainant's affidavit dated <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="3">March
 11, 1980</st1:date>, the seizure was 'undertaken by the plaintiff's
representatives, agents and counsel with my assistance' (Rec., p. 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This shows that he had delegated his primary
role in the seizure, in violation of the warrant that was exclusively addressed
to the Sheriff of Manila and to respondent as his assigned duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing is serious mis­conduct indeed,
coupled with gross negligence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent affirmed that it was his duty to conduct an
inventory of the items found in the vehicle seized (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>.,
March 27, 1981, p. 22).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one, least of
all respondent, would deny that such inventory should be made immediately <span style="">upon seizure </span>of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seizure was effected on January 8, 1980,
but it was only on January 10, 1980, or two days later, after the vehicle was
taken from the custody of plaintiff, that respondent deputy sheriff made his
'physical inventory' of the vehicle which he captioned 'Sheriff's Inventory'
(Exhibit 'E').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compared with the
observations of Atty. Domingo Lopez II, complainant's counsel, filed on the
same date with the Manila Sheriff's Office (Exhibit 'F'), respondent's
inventory, among other things, did not contain any finding as to the condition
of the car's body, and was clearly incomplete.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The warrant also ordered respondent deputy sheriff to keep
the property 'in your possession for five (5) days and at the expiration of
said period to deliver it to x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
plaintiff'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was not followed
by respondent who <u>upon seizure</u> turned over the vehicle to plaintiff
allegedly 'for the best interest of the property, so that it could be guarded
for safe­keeping pending its surrender to plaintiff which had interest in it' <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., </span><span style="">March 27, 1981, p. 21).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The alleged guarding by Alfredo Villegas
a sheriff guard assigned to watch the car while it was in the possession of
plaintiff proved ineffectual as the former only watched for eight (8) hours a
day, leaving the car in plaintiff's possession without sheriff's guard for 16
hours (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., April 14, 1981, p. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result is the claim that the car
sustained damages (Exhibit 'F').</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It would appear from respondent's actuation that he had
usurped judicial authority since he had no prior court permission to forthwith
deliver the vehicle to plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., March 27,
1981, <span style="">p. 22). His reason that he could
not take the vehicle to the sheriff's bodega, where it should have been taken (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., June 16, 1980, p. 6), because there was no longer
any space (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., March 27, 1981, p. 6), fails to
convince the undersigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
complainant complained to the acting chief of the Office of the City Sheriff of
Manila, the latter </span>ordered respondent to return the car to the sheriff's
office, which was done on <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="1">January 10,
 1980</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., June 16, 1980, pp. 9-13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This goes to show that respondent's actuation
was without the sanction of his office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the car could also have been deposited in the Compound of the Boy
Scouts of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1980</st1:date>, where in
fact it was deposited on <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="1">January 10,
 1980</st1:date>, after it was removed from plaintiff's possession and brought
to the Sheriff's Office (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., March 27, 1981, p.
27).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that respondent had
overlooked the Boy Scouts Compound where surely no controversy would arise, not
only reveals his desire to help plaintiff save on storage expenses (<span class="SpellE">T.S.N</span>., March 27, 1981, p. 27), but also <span style="">exposes his undue interest in plaintiff's
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing facts prove that
respondent violated the warrant as well as the pertinent provisions of the
Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Records show that herein respondent is also the respondent in
Administrative Matter No. P-2364, entitled:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Philippine Trial Lawyers Association Incorporated, Complainant, vs. <span class="SpellE">Humberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>, Respondent',
which was decided on October 27, 1980, and in which he was found 'guilty of
serious misconduct in office' and ordered 'to pay a fine equivalent to two (2)
months salary, with a warning that a repetition of the same or the same
analogous act will be dealt with more severely.' Further, there is also pending
against him Administrative Matter No. P-2329, entitled '<span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>, Complainant, vs. <span class="SpellE">Humberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Basco</span>, Respondent.' for engaging in the practice of
law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"His personal record shows that respondent has been in the
service for 10 to 12 years as Assistant Legal Officer of the City Sheriff of
Manila and as deputy sheriff; being a lawyer, he is deemed knowledgeable in his
field of work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the undersigned finds respondent <span class="SpellE">Humberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> to have committed
grave misconduct coupled with gross negligence, and to have failed to comply
with the mandates of the Warrant for the Seizure of Personal Property in Civil
Case No. 044361 entitled 'Commercial credit Corporation of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
Plaintiff, versus Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, et al.,
Defendants' issued by Judge Archimedes C. de Guzman of Branch VIII of the City
Court of Manila, as provided in Sections 3, 4 and 6, of Rule 60, of the Rules
of Court, amounting to gross misconduct.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Considering that the second count could be
considered as aggravating circumstances (<span class="SpellE">C.S.C</span>., MC
No. 8, June 26, 1979), as well as respondent's aforesaid length of service and
his recent sentence in Administrative Matter No.</span> <span class="GramE">P-2364,
not to include his pending case, Administrative Matter No.</span> P-2329, the
undersigned strongly recommends his dismissal from the service."</blockquote>
