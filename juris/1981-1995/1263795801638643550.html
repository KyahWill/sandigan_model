<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, Third Judicial District, Branch XXX, <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City found the petitioner guilty of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through falsification of public document.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged in the Information and

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Costs against accused."</span> <span class="GramE">(p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment, the petitioner appealed to the Court of
Appeals. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction with a
recommendation for executive clemency with respect to the duration of the
penalty, considering that the amount involved is only P166.67. The petitioner's
motion for reconsideration was denied. Hence, the present petition was filed on
the submission that:</p>

<blockquote>"(a) The former Court of Appeals decided the case contrary to
law, the evidence end the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court (Rule 45,
Sec. 4a, Rules of Court).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) Granting but without admitting that the accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Alonzo, signed the name of the complainant <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> in the voucher,
the crime committed is simple <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> under Art. <span class="GramE">315 of the Revised Penal Code and not a complex crime under Art.</span>
171 as ruled by the trial court and the respondent Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) The respondent Court (Intermediate Appellate Court)
gravely erred in affirming the decision of the trial court convicting the
accused, the herein petitioner of the crime charged in the information when the
prosecution failed to prove any crime against the accused, the herein
petitioner." <span class="GramE">(p. 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The following constitute the facts of the case from the viewpoint
of the accused:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> G. <span class="GramE">Alonzo,</span> was appointed as Clerk-typist in the Fire Department
of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City, designated as Personnel Officer in
charge of Finance. Some of his duties <span class="GramE">was</span> (sic) to
prepare payrolls, vouchers and others which are relevant to his position.
Sometime on October, 1974, the accused prepared the voucher for the salary of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> for the month of
October, 1974, who was employed as Firefighter in the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
City Fire Department. After preparing said voucher, the accused placed the same
on his table in the outgoing box as a usual practice in his office. It is the
duty of the messenger-clerk Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> to see
to it that all the vouchers prepared by the accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
G. Alonzo and placed in the outgoing box will be signed by those concerned and
to follow it up until the vouchers will be paid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of October 30, 1974, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> informed the accused that he has already
converted the voucher into cash and handed to the accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
G. Alonzo the amount of P166.67 appearing in the voucher of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> informing him (Alonzo) that he was in a hurry.
Some of his (Alonzo) officemates including the Administrative Officer was (sic)
present when Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> handed to him the
P166.67 and because <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span>
was not around at the time, he looked for him in the office and when he saw <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span>, he handed to him the full amount appearing in the
voucher in the amount of P166.67. The accused informed <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> that he is badly in need for money for his X-ray
and asked a loan of P66.00 from <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> which the
latter consented. No receipt was signed for the loan since they worked in the
office â€˜through trust and confidence'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The following morning, <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> and
the accused had a confrontation in the presence of the Fire Chief. The Fire
Chief inquired from Alonzo why <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> received less
than what he expected to receive and after the accused explained the
circumstances about the loan, the Fire Chief advised the accused to return the
amount loaned (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 2-12, hearing of December
7, 1977; Decision, <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 2526, p. 35
hereof).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A week after or on <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="11">November
 10, 1974</st1:date>, the accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> G. Alonzo
returned the amount of P66.00 which he loaned from <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> in the presence of their Fire Chief but the accused
did not ask <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> to issue receipt for the return of
his loan since it was in the presence of their Fire Chief. (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 114, id.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime on March 1975, or four months after payment of the
loan of P66.00, <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span>
filed a criminal complaint against <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> G.
Alonzo as a consequence of the loan of P66.00 but which was already paid on
November 10, 1974. And as a result, <span class="GramE">an Information</span> for
<span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> through Falsification of Public Documents was
filed against the accused, and the lower court convicted the accused of the
crime charged in the information.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In short, these were in synthesis, the basic facts of this
unfortunate case of the herein accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> G.
Alonzo which were clearly and conclusively established during the brief trial
of this criminal case. And this Honorable Court shall have that opportunity now
to fathom the noble dignity of our proofs tested in this regard for we are
confident that there is no room to hold the memory of 'Wrong Judgment' in the
hall of this Honorable Court, presided by jurists whose appointments were a
real credit to the Philippine Judiciary." <span class="GramE">(Appellant's
brief in the Court of Appeals, pp. 4-8; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
31-33).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the prosecution's version is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant was a clerk-typist in the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
Fire Department. He was designated as its finance officer. Among his duties was
the preparation of Vouchers and payrolls. Complainant <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> was employed as a fireman from March 1, 1973 to
July 31, 1975 with a monthly salary of P250.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime in October 1974, appellant prepared a voucher (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) <span class="GramE">for</span> the salary of
complainant for that month. He gave it to the office messenger, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, for the signature of those whose approval of
the voucher is required. When <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> first
received the voucher from appellant, Certification No. 1 bore a signature (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A-6), purportedly that of
complainant.</span> Certification No. 2 also was already signed by the Fire
Department Chief and was correspondingly initialed by complainant. After taking
the voucher to the city treasurer and city auditor for their signatures, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> returned the voucher to appellant. A few minutes
later, appellant called for <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, gave him back
the voucher and told him to get the money at the treasurer's office. <span class="GramE">This time, a signature (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A-8)
purportedly that of complainant appeared on the receipt of payment portion of
the voucher.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On October 30, 1974, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>
presented the voucher to the treasurer's office. The paymaster, Aida
Clark-Pineda, upon noting the signatures of the auditor and the complainant,
gave the proceeds of P166.67 to <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, whom she
knew to be a messenger in the fire department. <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>
signed the voucher as a witness. <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> returned
to the fire department and gave the amount to appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about 4:45 p.m., that same day, appellant gave complainant
only P100.00. <u style="text-underline:words">Complainant inquired about his
voucher and appellant showed him a voucher which amounted only to P100.00</u>.
Wondering how appellant was able to cash his voucher without his signing <span class="GramE">it,</span> complainant immediately went to the treasurer's office.
He discovered that his signature had been forged on the voucher and that the
amount he was entitled to receive was P166.67, not P100.00.He then realized
that the voucher showed him by appellant was different.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant then demanded the return of the balance. Since
appellant refused, complainant reported the matter to the fire department chief
who formed a fact-finding committee to look into the case. However, the
committee failed to render any report. Appellant paid back the amount he
withheld from complainant three weeks later. He had used the money to pay for
his x-ray.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"On August 4, 1975,
complainant submitted an Affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE">as</span> basis for his charge of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through
falsification of a public document against appellant. After preliminary
investigation was conducted, a </span><u style="text-underline:words">prima
facie</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> case was established, and so
an information was filed on February 20, 1976 charging appellant of the
aforementioned offense (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp. 4-28, October 11,
1976; pp. 2-12, November 9, 1977; p. 13, December 7, 1977; pp. 12-13, May 17,
1978)" (Emphasis supplied; pp. 26-28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>). <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether or not the petitioner misappropriated
P66.67 by forging another person's signature on the salary voucher.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information alleges that accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
G. Alonzo - (1) with intent to defraud, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously prepare or cause the preparation of an official
voucher pertaining to the salary of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> for a total of P166.67; (2) that he wrote, imitated,
forged, falsified the signature, and signed for <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> without the latter's knowledge, permission and
consent; (3) that he presented the said voucher for payment and received the
amount of P166.67; (4) once in possession of the said amount (P166.67), that he
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously
misappropriate, misapply and convert to his own personal use and benefit the
said amount; and (5) that, despite repeated demands, the accused refused and
continued to refuse to remit the above-mentioned amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the prosecution evidence tends to show that -
(1) the accused was designated as finance officer of the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
City Fire Department and among his duties was the preparation of vouchers and
payrolls; (2) on a date not specified in the records, the accused gave their
office messenger, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, a voucher for
the salary of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span>
for the month of October, 1974 so that the messenger could have it signed by
all those having a hand in the approval of vouchers; (3) after the voucher was
approved, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> returned the voucher to the
accused who instructed him to <span class="SpellE">encash</span> the voucher; (4)
Paymaster Aida Pineda of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City paid the
proceeds of the voucher to <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> who presented
the voucher for payment after she required <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>
to sign as witness to the payment; (6) Aida Pineda gave <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>
the full amount of P166.67; (7) after he received the proceeds of the voucher
from the paymaster, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> gave the entire amount
of P166.67 to the accused in the presence of his co-employees in the afternoon
of October 30, 1974 (Decision of the trial court, pp. 30-32, appellant's
brief).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above, it can be seen that the petitioner could not
possibly be guilty of <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully, and
feloniously preparing the complainant's voucher, considering that it was his
official duty to do so. He prepared the voucher of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> in the amount of P166.67 for the month of
October. There was no alteration made in the amount stated in the voucher
because the stated amount is the correct salary of the complainant for that
period. It was not the petitioner who presented the voucher for payment but
their office messenger, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>. The appellant did
not misappropriate the full amount of P166.67 nor did he refuse or continue to
refuse to remit the amount. In fact, he handed to <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> the amount of P100.00 on that same day while,
at the same time informing <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> that he was
borrowing the amount of P66.67 for his x-ray expense. On <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1974</st1:date>, the appellant paid the
complaining witness the amount of P66.67 upon the <span class="GramE">advise</span>
of the chief of the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City Fire Department.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence adduced by the prosecution is, therefore, entirely
different from what the information alleges.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there is no direct evidence showing that <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> G. Alonzo himself forged <span class="SpellE">Cadua's</span>
signature on the original voucher. Nobody actually saw him affix the alleged
signature (See <span class="SpellE">Ranon</span> v. Court of Appeals, 135 SCRA
495; and Cesar v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 134 SCRA 105). Even
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, who was responsible for routing
the voucher to all those who had a hand in approving the same could not
categorically state that he saw the accused forged complainant's signature. We
quote <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan's</span> testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
he gave this voucher, was Exhibit A-6 already present?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
about Exhibit A-8? <span class="GramE">(Fiscal referring to the signature of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span>)?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None yet sir, because this voucher
cannot be released if that is already signed. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., page 4, hearing of </span><st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="11"><span class="GramE">Nov. 9, 1977</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he gave it back to you, was the
receipt portion already signed, referring to Exhibit A-B, was this already

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</span> <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 8, id).</span> <span class="GramE">(p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More important, from the facts of the case as stated in the
People's brief below, the forgery is supposed to be on a voucher showing the
amount of P100.00. It was this voucher which was allegedly shown to the
complainant. This second voucher had nothing to do with the original voucher
used to collect the salary. If there was such a second voucher, it was a
non-official voucher used to lull the complainant into believing his salary was
only P100.00. However, this story of a supposed forged document does not
explain how the complainant could have been hoodwinked because the original
voucher for P166.67 carried his correct salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the petitioner prepared the voucher, considering it
was his official duty to prepare the payroll, vouchers, and other documents
assigned to him is not a sufficient reason for the respondent court to conclude
that "there is no doubt that the forgery or falsification was effected by
the appellant". Unfortunately, the respondent court mistakenly applied the
rule that: "one found in possession of and who used a forged document is
the forger or the one who caused the forgery and, therefore, is guilty of falsification
(See <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span> v. Court of Appeals, 19 SCRA 688). The
accused is entitled to the constitutional presumption of innocence especially
where the evidence on the alleged forged voucher is extremely doubtful. As held
in the case of <u style="text-underline:words">People v. <span class="SpellE">Clores</span></u>,
(125 SCRA 67):</p>

<blockquote>XXX<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">XXX</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">XXX</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">Every</span> circumstance against guilt, and in favor of innocence
must be considered. Suspicion no matter how strong should not sway judgment,
for well-established is the rule that the prosecution must rely on the strength
of its evidence and not on the weakness of the defense; that appellants need
not prove their innocence because that is presumed; that the presumption of
innocence is a conclusion of law in favor of the accused, whereby his innocence
is not only established but continues until sufficient evidence is introduced
to overcome the proof which the law has created -- that is, his innocence; â€˜that
conscience must be satisfied that defendant has been proven guilty of the
offense charged. Only by proof beyond reasonable doubt which requires moral
certainty, 'a certainty that convinces and satisfies the reason and conscience
of those who are to act upon it' may the presumption of innocence be overcome.'
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Inguito</span>, 117 SCRA 641, 649)." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 75).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Cadua's</span> intention in
filing a complaint against the petitioner was to get even against the chief of
their Fire Department.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that at around 7 o'clock in the evening of
October 30, 1974, <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span>
approached the Fire Chief and complained that he received less than what
appeared in the voucher. He actually never complained why his signature was
falsified nor did he complain that the accused falsified his signature. Much
less was any mention made about <u>another</u> voucher with only P100.00
entered as the <span class="GramE">amount.</span> The next morning, <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> and the accused had a confrontation in the presence
of the Fire Chief. After explaining the circumstances of the loan, the Fire
Chief advised the accused to return the amount loaned. On November 10, 1974,
the accused returned the amount to <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> in the
present of the Fire Chief. It was only four months after this incident that <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadua</span> filed a complaint
against the accused. The reason why he filed the case is clearly manifested in
his cross-examination which we quote hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. DANTE:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you filed this case in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office was the
P66.67 already paid?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the above admission it is clear that the filing of the complaint
was merely an <u>afterthought</u> arising from the non-renewal of the
complainant's appointment by the Fire Chief who is related to the accused. When
the accused informed the complainant that he had nothing to do with the
non-renewal of the latter's appointment, the complainant executed an affidavit
of desistance. It is true that an affidavit of desistance by the complainant is
not looked upon with favor. It may, however, create serious doubts as to the
liability of the accused (Gomez v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 135 SCRA 620).
In this particular case, it corroborates the appellant's explanation about the
filing of the criminal charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing, we are constrained to rule that
the evidence on record cannot sustain a verdict of guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the
petition is hereby GRANTED. The judgment of the respondent court is REVERSED
