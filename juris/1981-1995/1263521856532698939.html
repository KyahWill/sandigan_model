This is an appeal from a decision of the defunct Court of First Instance
 of Albay in Criminal Case No. 4572 where the appellants - CESAR 
LUDOVICE, MANUEL LUDOVICE and RODOLFO LOBRIANO - were accused of robbery
 with rape but were found guilty of rape only because of insufficient 
evidence in respect of the robbery.
<p>
The judgment of the trial court reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the Court finds the three accused, CESAR LUDOVICE, 
MANUEL LUDOVICE and RODOLFO LOBRIANO alias "Rudy" guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as defined and punished under Art.
 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act 4111 and 
therefore hereby sentences them to suffer the penalty of "<em>Reclusion Perpetua</em>";
 to indemnify the offended party jointly and severally in the sum of 
P5,000.00 by way of damages without subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency and the costs.  The charge for robbery is hereby dismissed 
for insufficiency of evidence." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 133.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The appellants make the following assignment of errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (1)  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING UNDUE CREDIT TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT AND HER WITNESSES;
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO CONSIDER THE FINDINGS OF THE
 PHYSICIAN AS APPEARING IN THE MEDICO LEGAL CERTIFICATE EXHIBIT B; and
  </p>
  <p> (3) THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO CONDUCT AN OCULAR 
INSPECTION OF THE PREMISES IN SPITE OF THE REQUEST OF THE COMPLAINANT 
AND THE COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED." (Brief, 22-23.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first assignment of error deals with the credibility of witnesses.
</p><p>
The People's version of the rape as gathered principally from the testimony of the complainant is summarized as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Having been invited by her friend, the maid of Atty. Miles 
Ludovice, complainant Leticia Padua attended the party in the lawyer's 
house at Locsin, Daraga, Albay, in the evening of September 25, 1966.  
(p. 12, TSN, June 8, 1967) The place of the merry­making was just a 
stone's throw from the house of the spouses Matias and Gloria Magdaong 
for whom complainant herself worked as a maid.  (pp. 10-11, TSN, June 8,
 1967) </p>
  <p>
  At about 10:00 p.m., while complainant was conversing with her friend 
in the sala, appellants Cesar Ludovice and Manuel Ludovice, nephews of 
Atty. Miles Ludovice, introduced themselves to her.  (pp. 3-4, 13, TSN, 
June 8, 1967)
  </p>
  <p>
  Shortly thereafter, complainant left for the house of her sister Adela
 Padua, to inquire if she would join the party.  As she was passing the 
house of the Misolas, complainant noticed that appellants Cesar 
Ludovice, Manuel Ludovice and Rodolfo Lubiano were following her.  
Suddenly, Rodolfo Lubiano seized her by the left arm, Manuel Ludovice 
went behind her and cupped his hand over her mouth, while Cesar Ludovice
 held her by right arm.  Appellants dragged and pushed complainant 
towards the church.  She struggled and tried to kick them, but to no 
avail.  (pp. 4-5, 13-14, 15-16, TSN, June 8, 1967)
  </p>
  <p> When they reached a place beside the church where a large acacia 
tree stood, appellants forced complainant to the ground.  Again she 
tried to kick appellants and hit them with one of her arms which became 
momentarily free.  Her efforts were futile.  Appellants slid her jeans 
and panty down to her legs.  Then, alternating in restraining 
complainant and preventing her from making an outcry, they succes­sively
 had sexual intercourse with her.  Rodolfo Lubiano was the first, Manuel
 Ludovice was the next, and Cesar Ludovice was the last.  (pp. 5-7, TSN,
 June 8, 1967; p. 4, TSN, June 9, 1967) </p>
  <p>
  After raping complainant, appellants withdrew to a distance of about 
fifteen or twenty meters to confer among themselves.  Meanwhile, 
complainant hurriedly fixed her clothes and started to run home.  
Appellants tried to give chase but failed to catch her.  (p. 8, TSN, 
June 9, 1967; p. 3, TSN, June 14, 1967)
  </p>
  <p>
  When she reached home, complainant thoroughly washed her genitalia 
because she felt dirty on account of what appellants had done to her.  
(p. 7, TSN, June 9, 1967; p. 5, TSN, June 14, 1967)
  </p>
  <p>
  The following day, September 26, 1966, she reported to her employer 
Gloria Magdaong what was done to her by appellants.  Gloria Magdaong 
advised here to report the matter to the police, which she did.  (pp. 
6-9, TSN, June 14, 1967)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Complainant also went to the Albay Provincial Hospital on the same day, 
September 26, 1966, for physical and medical examination.  (p. 9, TSN, 
June 8, 1967; pp. 9-10, TSN, June 14, 1967) The results of the 
examination are set forth in the medical certificate (Exhibit B) issued 
by Dr. Salvador Petelos:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(1) PHYSICAL EXAMINATION - Did not reveal any evidence of injury; </p>
  <p> "(2) INTERNAL EXAMINATION REVEALED: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> (1) Middle 3rd of the inner part of both labia menora with reddish bluish dis­coloration; </p>
    <p>
        (2) Hymen highly elastic, no evidence of injury;
    </p>
    <p>
        (3) Introitus admits one finger easily and 2 fingers snugly.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "(3) MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION - Negative for spermatozoa."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On September 27, 1966, complainant reported to her father, Marcelino 
Otico, that she was raped by appellants.  (pp. 6-7, TSN, September 29, 
1967)" (Brief, pp. 1-5)
</p><p>
Appellant Rodolfo Lobriano was an 18-year old student when he testified 
on October 16, 1967.  He said that he was at the house of Atty. Miles 
Ludovice in the evening of September 25, 1966 to attend a birthday party
 of their Lolang Tina.  Cesar and Manuel Ludovice were with him when a 
girl arrived.  He approached the girl and intro­duced himself as Boy 
Lobriano; she answered that her nickname was Letty.  They went to the 
balcony where he "asked her whether she could allow me to have 
something; in reply, she told me it would be alright as long as it is 
not bad." (TSN, p. 104.) He also told her "Letty, I have a feeling for 
you." (Id.) Thereafter, Letty asked him to go to the Luneta arid on the 
way Letty told him that she was the maid of Matias Magdaong who had bad 
intentions for her.  Letty decided to go home via the back door for 
which reason they had to pass by the Daraga Catholic Church.  Near the 
church, Letty asked for his full name and she in turn said that her name
 was Leticia Padua.  What happened thereafter according to Lobriano is 
best told in his own words, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q     [Atty. Ludovice] You said that she stopped at that moment 
when she asked you about your real name, what else happened if any? </p>
  <p>
    A       I asked Letty whether she also have an affection for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What did she tell you?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       No reply, she told me:  'I will give you my answer provided you do not fool me.'
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What else happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       After saying that I also said that if it is true that you like me, can you prove that statement to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What else happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       After telling me that she embraced me and kissed me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What did you also do upon being embraced and being kissed by Letty?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       I first detached myself from her.
  </p>
  <p>
    COURT
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      Did you not embrace her also?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       Not yet, Your Honor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      Did you not kiss her also?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       I kissed her also because she kissed me.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Q      After you had detached yourself, what else happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       She asked me where I was going and I said I am not going anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What else transpired?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       Then I asked Letty again:  'Letty if you really love me can you give me one thing which I will ask from you?'
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What did she say?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       She did not reply but she sat down near the acacia tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      Was that acacia tree still standing or was it already lying down to the ground?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       It is a living and standing acacia tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      When this was happening was there any person that you noticed around the vicinity of the church?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       No, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      When you left the balcony of the house of Cesar Ludovice, where were Cesar Ludovice and Manuel Ludovice?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       They were already in the house of Atty. Ludovice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      You said that the girl sat at the foot of the acacia tree, what happened there?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       I also sat down near the acacia tree behind her and then asking her, 'Letty are you willing to go with me now?'
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What did Letty say?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       She did not reply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What did you do?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       I continued sitting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What else happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       When I was sitted [seated] beside her already I put my right
 arm around her body and kissed her; and in so doing, I noticed that she
 was inclining herself downward.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      At this particular moment what happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       Then she continued to lie down and then I was already on top of her.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      While you were on top of her what happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       When I was on top of her I kissed her and after doing so, I 
lifted my head and asked her this question again, 'Letty somebody might 
see us.'
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      What did she tell you?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       She told me that nobody was around.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q      And then what happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A       I once again kissed her and at the same time I felt that her
 buttocks were being raised towards the lower portion of my body.
  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant Manuel Ludovice was a 20-year old farmer when he testified on 
January 11, 1968.  He was at the house of Atty. Ludovice on September 
25, 1966 because of a birthday party.  Rodolfo Lobriano and Cesar 
Ludovice were there also.  He saw Rodolfo engaged in a conversation with
 Leticia Padua.  He had not known Leticia before that time.  He was 
asked by the mother of Rodolfo to get Rodolfo but Rodolfo and the girl 
had left so he and Cesar Ludovice went looking for them.  They found the
 pair at the foot of an acacia tree near the church having sexual 
intercourse.  The time was about 11:30 in the evening.  He even heard 
the following exchange between the pair:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q        [Atty. Ludovice] After a while what happened next? </p>
  <p>
    A         Then Lubiano [Lobriano] said, 'It has not yet entered.'
  </p>
  <p>
    Q        What else happened?
  </p>
  <p> A         Then Leticia answered, 'No it is inside already.'" (TSN, p. 163.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After the act, Leticia stayed lying on her back with her jeans down.  He
 also wanted to have Intercourse with her and was about to do so when he
 desisted because Leticia was crying.  After Leticia had stood up, Cesar
 Ludovice arrived.  They returned to the Ludovice residence with Leticia
 and on the way Cesar told Leticia, "You also yield to him in order that
 he would not disclose or reveal the thing that happened." (TSN, p. 
168.)
</p><p>
The trial court summarized Manuel's testimony as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q      So what happened in this case is this:  Lubiano [Lobriano]
 had sexual intercourse with Padua, you wanted also to have sexual 
intercourse with Padua, but Padua rose up and then Cesar Ludovice also 
asked that he be given so that he would not reveal or disclose the 
matter, is that correct? </p>
  <p> A       Yes, your Honor." (TSN, p. 170.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant Cesar Ludovice was an 18-year old messenger when he testified 
on January 11, 1968.  He was also at the house of Atty. Ludovice where a
 birthday party was held in the evening of September 25, 1966.  He went 
with Manuel Ludovice to look for Rodolfo Lobriano.  He saw two persons 
near the church and, "Well, I came to know that one of the persons we 
were following was Rodolfo Lubiano [Lobriano] and the other one was 
Leticia Padua only after that incident or trouble when we already went 
there." (TSN, p. 192.) After Rodolfo had gone home, "I also asked her if
 she would also give way to me but she did not answer." (TSN, p. 194.)
</p><p>
A comparison of the People's version and that of the appellants easily 
leads to the conclusion that credibility weighs definitely in favor of 
the former.  For the People's version is straight-forward and consistent
 whereas the appellants' version suffers from fatal infirmities.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Item</em>:  Rodolfo Lobriano stated that it was Leticia who 
initiated the physical contact between them.  Since they had just met at
 the party and were perfect strangers before that, it is not possible to
 believe his story because the Filipino woman is shy and reserved by 
nature which makes her a difficult prey for the predatory male.

  <p> <em>Item</em>:  Rodolfo said it was Leticia who made suggestive 
motions for coitus but if it were so why was she crying when Manuel 
Ludovice saw her and why did Cesar Ludovice speak of "that incident or 
trouble" at the site where he saw Rodolfo and Leticia? </p>
  <p>
    <em>Item</em>:  Rodolfo claimed he as not able to enter Leticia but Manuel's testimony shows that he did.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Item</em>:  The testimony of Rodolfo, Manuel and Cesar show very clearly that each one was lusting for Leticia.

The appellants' second assignment of error relies on the medical 
certificate - Exhibit B - to support their claim that there was no rape.
  They point to the statement that Leticia's physical examination "did 
not reveal any evidence of injury" and the microscopic examination was 
"negative for spermatozoa."
</p><p>
The absence of physical injury and spermatozoa does not negate the fact of rape.
</p><p>
The absence of contusion or hematoma on Leticia does not belie her claim
 that she was raped.  According to Leticia the appellants held her 
tightly on different parts of her body but she was not beaten or 
other­wise injured.  Under such circumstances the absence of physical 
injury is normal, not unusual.
</p><p>
As to the absence of spermatozoa, Leticia said that when she arrived 
home after the rape she washed herself thoroughly because she felt dirty
 - as who would not?  Moreover, to prove rape it is not neces­sary to 
show the presence of spermatozoa.  (People vs. Selfaison, L-14732, 
January 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 235.)
</p><p>
After the decision of the trial court had been promulgated, the accused 
filed a motion for new trial.  One of the grounds invoked in the motion 
was a reiteration of their request for an ocular inspection "of the 
route and of the place where the act complained of had allegedly been 
committed." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 137.) The trial court denied the 
motion and the denial of the request for an ocular inspection is now 
assigned as an error.  This assignment of error cannot be sustained for 
the same reason given by the trial court in denying the motion for new 
trial.  The fact of sexual intercourse is there and cannot be denied.  
The only issue is whether or not Leticia gave consent.  The physical 
environment has no relevance to the fact and the issue.
</p><p>
This is a case of multiple rape where three persons using their superior
 strength successively raped Leticia.  Each of the three is guilty of 
three separate crimes of rape because each is responsible not only for 
the rape committed by him but also for the rape committed by the others.
  (People vs. Jose, et al., L-28232, February 6, 1971, 37 SCRA 450.)
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is hereby modified by 
sentencing each of the appellants to serve the penalty of three (3) <em>reclusion perpetua</em>;
 to indemnify Leticia Padua jointly and severally the sum of Thirty 
Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos; and to pay the proportionate share of the 
costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
