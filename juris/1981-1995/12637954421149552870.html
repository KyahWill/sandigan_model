<p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision dated May 7, 1981 of the then 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> finding the accused <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span>, <em>alias</em> 
<span class="SpellE">Pedy</span>, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <em>Reclusion Perpetua</em> 
with all the accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay the heirs of the 
deceased, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span>, the sum of P12,000.00, 
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 6-23).</p>
<p class="BODY">It appears from the records that at about 9:00 o'clock in the 
evening of January 18, 1978, a group composed of Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, the deceased Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span>, Edgar <span class="SpellE">Resma</span>, Jose 
<span class="SpellE">Hortel</span>, Philip <span class="SpellE">Empacis</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Titong</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillon</span> and 
<span>Ely Boy <span class="SpellE">Cañares</span> were walking along <span class="SpellE">Tonkil</span> Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Minglanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, on</span><span> </span><span>their way to <span class="SpellE">Linao</span> where they live (TSN, June 5, 1979, pp. 11-15, 
75).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It was already <st1:time hour="11" minute="30">11:30 
o'clock</st1:time> when they were passing the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> at <span class="SpellE">Lipata</span>, <span class="SpellE">Minglanilla</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> and Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> were following their five companions at a 
distance of twenty-five (25) meters (<em>Ibid</em>., pp. 16-17).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>As they approached the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span>, he came out of the gate of his residence allegedly 
to check the commotion in the street.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sergio greeted the 
accused:<span>&nbsp; </span>"Good evening, <span class="SpellE">Noy</span>," and the 
accused answered:<span>&nbsp; </span>"Good evening, also". <span>&nbsp;</span>After the 
exchange of greetings, <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> walked towards the 
group ahead.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> and 
Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> followed the accused and when the 
latter reached the group, Sergio and <span>Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> </span>were about four (4) meters away.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> scolded the whole group and 
asked:<span>&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE"><em>Nganong</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>nagabusar</em></span><em> mo denhi?</em>" (Why are you so 
abusive here?)<span>&nbsp; </span>The accused continued to scold them particularly 
Ely Boy <span class="SpellE">Cañares</span> (<em>Ibid</em>., pp. 19-31, 
89-90).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>While they were being confronted, the deceased Sergio 
</span><span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> asked for forgiveness from the 
accused saying, "<span class="SpellE"><em>Pasayloa</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>lang</em></span><em> mi, Noy, di</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>namo</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>usbon</em></span>" 
(Please, forgive us, <span class="SpellE">Noy</span>, we'll not repeat it).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The accused did not answer but continued scolding all of them.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The deceased Sergio continued <span>to a</span>sk forgiveness for about 
five (5) times <span>on </span>behalf of the group (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 
31-33).</p>
<p class="BODY">However, the accused <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span>, with a 
pistol in his hand, which was later identified to be a .45 caliber from shells 
recovered from the scene of the crime, fired two shots into the air.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Except for Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> who was scared, and 
<span>Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> who tried to talk to the 
accused by asking </span>once more for forgiveness the group slowly dispersed 
(<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 33-37).</p>
<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the accused, who was still infuriated, fired a 
third shot aimed pointblank at the forehead of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 37-39, 98-100).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The victim fell down and died instantly.<span>&nbsp; </span>The accused 
continued to move around.<span>&nbsp; </span>Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> tried to help his fallen companion but the accused 
pointed the gun at him asking:<span>&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE"><em>Dili</em></span><em> ka modagan?&nbsp; </em><span class="SpellE"><em>Laban</em></span><span class="GramE"><em> ka ba?</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; </span>(Are you going to run or to defend him?) 
Upon hearing this, <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> ran away (<em>Ibid.</em>, 
pp. 40-42).</p>
<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the other members of the group arrived at their 
respective houses in <span class="SpellE">Linao</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>After 
twenty-five minutes, the six companions of the victim, together with the 
victim's four brothers, returned to the scene of the incident to retrieve the 
victim's body (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 45-46).<span>&nbsp; </span>However, they found 
nothing there except traces of human blood and the slippers of the victim on the 
exact spot where the group had been confronted by the accused.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They searched the nearby <span>locality </span>of <span class="SpellE">Linao</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The victim's brothers also inquired 
from all the hospitals in <span class="SpellE">Minglanilla</span> as well as in 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> but the body could not be found 
(<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 47-48).</p>
<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date month="1" day="19" year="1978">January 19, 1978</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> 
reported the shooting incident to the Office of the Station Commander, <span class="SpellE">Minglanilla</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Clariño</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Basabe</span> was assigned to 
investigate the case (TSN, pp. 49-50, June 5, 1979; TSN, p. 30, June 6, 
1979).<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> pointed to the accused 
<span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> as the assailant of the deceased (TSN, p. 52, 
June 5, 1979).<span>&nbsp; </span>The mother and relatives of the victim likewise 
reported the incident to the Office of the Station Commander (TSN, pp. 3-6, June 
6, 1979).<span>&nbsp; </span>It appears further from the records that a certain Pat. 
Arturo <span class="SpellE">Larrobis</span> went to the scene of the crime at 
about <st1:time hour="0" minute="0">12:00 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time hour="0" minute="0">midnight</st1:time> <span>on </span><st1:date month="1" day="18" year="1978">January 18, 1978</st1:date> and turned over to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Basabe</span></span><span class="GramE"> three (3)

Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Basabe</span> identified <span>the body </span>to 
be that of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> (TSN, p. 58, June 5, 
1979; TSN, p. 15, June 6, 1979).</p>
<p class="BODY">The body of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> was 
brought back to <span class="SpellE">Minglanilla</span> by the Cosmopolitan 
Funeral Parlor (TSN, pp. 66-67, June 5, 1979).<span>&nbsp; </span>Later on, an 
autopsy was performed on the victim's cadaver by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> Y. <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, the National 
Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Medico-Legal Officer for <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> and <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place> (TSN, p. 126, 
July 16, 1979).<span>&nbsp; </span>A necropsy report prepared by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> dated February 6, 
1979 stated among others that the cause of death of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> was a gunshot wound in the head (Exhibit G, p. 3,

<p class="BODY">The accused claims that the trial court relied only on 
circumstantial evidence for his conviction.<span>&nbsp; </span>The claim is not 
meritorious because he was clearly and positively identified by the prosecution 
witnesses as the assailant.<span>&nbsp; </span>For one, witness Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> actually saw the accused fire at the victim Sergio 
<span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> (TSN, June 5, 1979, p. 37; Exhibit H, 
Folder of Exhibits, p. 4).<span>&nbsp; </span>Nobody, except the accused, confronted 
the members of the group of the deceased Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> during the time of the shooting.<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
is undisputed that the accused came down from his house on that fateful night to 
investigate the group that was making noise in the street (TSN, October 16, 
1980, p. 67).<span>&nbsp; </span>He was so angry that he confronted the group and 
even scolded the members (TSN, October 16, 1980, p. 91).</p>
<p class="BODY">When the accused fired two successive shots into the air, the 
members of the group, except <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> and the victim, 
dispersed and ran away for safety (TSN, June 5, 1979, p. 35).<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
third shot was aimed pointblank at the victim who was barely a meter away from 
the accused (TSN, June 5, 1979, p. 37).<span>&nbsp; </span>The shot at the victim was 
so sudden that the latter had no opportunity to defend <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> was actually talking and apologizing for the 
conduct of the members of his group when he was suddenly fired upon by the 
accused (TSN, June 5, 1979, pp. 36-37).</p>
<p class="BODY">The records reveal that the accused used a .45 cal. pistol as 
gleaned from the three empty shells recovered from the scene of the crime, which 
also confirm the number of shots he had fired that night (TSN, June 5, 1979, pp. 
36-37).</p>
<p class="BODY">The testimony of Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, 
pointing to the accused as the perpetrator of the crime, was made in a direct 
and forthright manner, and is affirmed by his sworn statement made on the day 
following the incident, <st1:date month="1" day="19" year="1978">January 19, 
1978</st1:date>, in the office of the Station Commander (Exhibit "H", Folder of 
Exhibits, pp. 4-5).</p>
<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Jose <span class="SpellE">Hortel</span>, another 
eye-witness to the incident, gave a sworn statement to the effect that the 
accused fired two successive shots in the air, after which he pointed his gun at 
the members of the group, and when <span>the </span>gun was aimed at Sergio, the 
gun suddenly fired and Sergio fell.<span>&nbsp; </span>This sworn statement of Jose 
<span class="SpellE">Hortel</span> was <span>given on the day following the 
incident on </span><st1:date month="1" day="19" year="1978"><span>January 19, 
1978</span></st1:date><span>, “when extraneous forces were not yet exerted upon 
him and his only motive was to tell the truth" (See Exhibit I, I-translation, 
Folder of Exhibits, pp. 6-8).<span>&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that on 
</span><st1:date month="3" day="20" year="1979"><span>March 20, 
1979</span></st1:date><span> or fourteen (14) months after the incident, Jose 
<span class="SpellE">Hortel</span> made a retraction exculpating the accused, 
which the trial court did not consider because it was highly suspicious (See 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 20; CFI Decision, p. 15).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It </span>is <span>generally said that retraction of witnesses must be 
taken warily (<em>People vs. Lao Wan Sing</em>, 125 SCRA 45 
[1983]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Therefore, the positive identification made by Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Hortel</span> of the 
accused <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> as the perpetrator of the crime cannot 
be overcome by the mere denial of the accused himself and defense witnesses, 
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Oberes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Deiparine</span>, who stated that the firing came from the 
group but without identifying who fired the gun.<span>&nbsp; </span>The positive 
identification of the accused by the witnesses that he killed the victim 
establishes the guilt of the accused to a moral certainty (<em>People vs. 
Demeterio</em>, 124 SCRA 914 [1983]; <em>People vs. Cunanan</em>, 75 SCRA 15 
[1977].</p>
<p class="BODY">Accused <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> contends also that the 
prosecution should have presented Jose <span class="SpellE">Hortel</span> to 
corroborate the testimony of Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, instead 
of just relying on his sworn statement taken before the police.</p>
<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>The matter of 
presenting witnesses for the People is a prerogative of the prosecuting 
fiscal.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, there was no need to present Jose 
<span class="SpellE">Hortel</span> because the testimony of Victor <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> was already clear, sufficient and 
convincing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that the testimony of a single 
witness, if credible and positive and if it satisfies the court beyond 
reasonable doubt, is sufficient to convict (<em>People vs. Vengco</em>, 127 SCRA 
242 [1984]; <em>People vs. Martinez</em>; 127 SCRA 760 [1984]; <em>People vs. 
Demeterio</em>, 124 SCRA 914 [1983]).<span>&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the credibility of 
evidence is not necessarily determined by the number of witnesses but the 
quality of testimony (<em>People vs. Pascual</em>, 127 SCRA 174 [1984]).</p>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Evident premeditation was not present in the commission of 
the crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>To properly appreciate evident premeditation, it is 
necessary to establish with proof, as clear as the </span>evidence of the crime 
itself, (1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an 
act manifestly indicating that the culprit had clung to his determination; and 
(3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and the execution to 
allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act (<em>People vs. 
Guiapar</em>, 129 SCRA 539 [1984]; <em>People vs. Gravino</em>, 122 SCRA 123 
[1983]; <em>People vs. Camano</em>, 115 SCRA 688 [1982]).<span>&nbsp; </span>In the 
case at bar, the prosecuting fiscal failed to establish the aforesaid 
requisites.<span>&nbsp; </span>Besides, there is no showing that the accused had 
planned to kill the victim Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>However, it is clear that treachery attended the commission 
of the crime and qualifies it to murder.<span>&nbsp; </span>Attendance of treachery 
as a </span><span>qualifying circumstance is founded upon </span><span>the 
concurrence of two (2) conditions, to wit:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) the employment of 
means, method, or manner of execution which would insure the offender's safety 
from any defensive or retaliatory act on the part of the offended party, which 
means that <span>no </span>opportunity is given the latter to defend himself or 
to retaliate; and (2) that such means, method, or manner of execution was 
deliberately or consciously chosen (<em>People vs. Ganut</em>, 118 SCRA 35 
[1982]).<span>&nbsp; </span>It has been proven that the deceased Sergio <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span> was shot while he was in the act of asking for 
forgiveness from the accused <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The shooting of the victim was so sudden that the latter had no 
opportunity to defend <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Treachery 
is present in case the attack is sudden and unexpected (<em>People vs. 
Alfaro</em>, 119 SCRA 204 [1982]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Finally, accused <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> admitted 
that the Volkswagen Brasilia car brought to the PC Headquarters in 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span>Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span> 
belonged to him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just after the victim was shot, his body was 
removed from the scene of the incident and found in a ravine at <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span>Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span>, 
which is about sixty (60) kilometers away from the scene of the crime.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A laboratory examination of the tangerine rug inside the 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Brasilia</span></st1:place></st1:city><span> 
car of the accused conducted by Myrna Areola, Forensic Chemist of the PC, showed 
that the blood stains on the car's rug were those of a human being.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Evidently, the accused decided to load the dead body of his victim into 
his 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Brasilia</span></st1:place></st1:city><span> 
car and dumped it into a ravine 200 feet deep at <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span>Cebu</span></span></span></st1:place><span> in order to hide 
the effects of his criminal act.<span>&nbsp; </span>This actuation of the accused 
<span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span> in dumping 
the body of his victim constitutes an outrage or scoffing </span>at the corpse 
of the victim which is another <span>qualifying circumstance in the commission 
of </span>the crime of murder.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>PREMISES CONSIDERED,</span></b><span> </span>the judgment
