The accused-appellants, Francisco Centeno <em>alias</em> "Panchito", Juan Centeno <em>alias</em> "Totok" and Manuel Centeno <em>alias</em>
 "Iyao", were charged with the crime of murder in an information filed 
on July 10, 1972 with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, 11th 
Judicial District. The information alleged that the three (3) accused, 
cons­piring and working together, armed with firearms and with treachery
 and evident premeditation inflicted wounds on Nestor Asistido which 
caused his death.
<p>
On April 18, 1974, the trial court found the accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <em>homicide </em>with
 the aggravating circumstance of their having taken advantage of 
superior strength which was offset by the mitigating circumstance of 
voluntary surrender and sentenced each of them to suffer imprisonment of
 not less than six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>,
 as minimum, to not more than fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and 
twenty-one (21) days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, with all the 
accessory penalties provided for by law, to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased the sum of Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00) for the death of 
Nestor Asistido, and in addition thereto the sum of Thirty-three 
Thousand Six Hundred Ninety-six Pesos (P33,696.00) for loss of income, 
plus Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) for moral damages, and to pay the 
costs.
</p><p>
The decision of the trial court was appealed to the then Court of Appeals.
</p><p>
On July 14, 1978, in a decision penned by Associate Justice Ameurfina A.
 Melencio-Herrera and concurred in by Associate Justices Lorenzo Relova 
and Simeon M. Gopengco, the Court of Appeals found from the records that
 the circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation were clearly 
attendant to the commission of the crime and, therefore, found the 
accused-appellants guilty of murder as charged in the information. 
According to the appellate court, the penalty prescribed by Article 248 
of the Revised Penal Code for the crime of murder is reclusion temporal 
in its maximum period to death. Following Section 34 of the Judiciary 
Act and Section 12 of Rule 124 of the Rules of Court, however, the Court
 of Appeals refrained from entering judgment and certified the case to 
this Court for final determination.
</p><p>
On October 30, 1981, this Court after discussing the guidelines in <em>People v. Daniel</em> (86 SCRA 511) on the preliminary issue therein promulgated a resolution which, inter alia, reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Accordingly, We refrain from passing on the correctness of the 
assessment of the evidence by the Court of Appeals which We find to be 
sufficiently thorough and exhaustive, and let said Court determine for 
itself what the proper penalty should be under its own analysis of the 
evidence, in accordance with the aforecited ruling of People v. Daniel, 
supra. </p>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, let this case be returned to the Court of Appeals for proper action as above indicated."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We have carefully reviewed the entire records of this appeal. We find 
correct the factual findings and conclusions of law in the amended 
decision penned by Associate Justice Rodolfo A. Nocon and concurred in 
by Associate Justices Juan A. Sison and Federico B. Alfonso of the 
Intermediate Appellate Court. We, therefore, adopt the said decision in 
its entirety and append it as an integral part of this decision. The 
award for actual and moral damages, being supported by evidence, is 
affirmed.
</p><p>
Following the precedent set in <em>People v. de la Fuente</em> (126 SCRA
 518) wherein this Court increased the civil liability awarded by the 
trial court to Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00), the award of Twelve 
Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00) as indemnification for the death of Nestor 
Asistido is increased to Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, this Court finds the accused-appellants Francisco Centeno <em>alias</em> "Panchito", Juan Centeno <em>alias</em> "Totok" and Manuel Centeno <em>alias</em>
 "Iyao" guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder. The 
sentence of imprisonment imposed by the trial court on each of the 
accused-appellants is MODIFIED to <em>RECLUSION PERPETUA</em> and the 
Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00) awarded as indemnification is 
increased to THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (P30,000.00). In all other respects, 
the judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Plana, Escolin,</em> and <em>De La Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera</em> and <em>Relova, JJ.</em>, no part, having participated in the Court of Appeals’ decision.

ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
The accused Francisco Centeno <em>alias</em> "Panchito," Juan Centeno <em>alias</em> "Totok," and Manuel Centeno <em>alias</em>
 "Iyao" were originally charged with the crime of Murder in an 
information filed by the Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo on 10 July 1972. 
After trial, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, Branch IV, found 
them guilty of Homicide, hence this appeal.
</p><p>
The evidence for the prosecution is as follows:
</p><p>
The three accused, FRANCISCO Centeno, JUAN Centeno and MANUEL Centeno 
are brothers. They are all residents of Barrio Maiayuan, Ajuy, Iloilo. 
FRANCISCO, the eldest, was the Barrio Captain of the place having held 
the position for four terms. They had another brother, Florentino, who 
was married to one Ester Causing with whom he had two children. This 
couple converted a portion of the seashore of Barrio Malayuan into a 
docking place for a motor boat named Evelyn HI owned by Serafin Opinion,
 Jr, This boat used to ferry passengers and cargo from Barrio Malayuan, 
Ajuy to Victorias, Negros Occidental, and back. The spouses Florentino 
Centeno and Ester Causing operated this motor boat, receiving 
commissions for every passenger and cargo carried. A commission of P2.00
 each was also being paid to the accused, FRANCISCO, JUAN,MANUEL and 
another brother, use, for helping in the operation of the motor boat. 
The couple had an errand boy named Nestor Asistido, who was also being 
paid a commission of P2.00.
</p><p>
On 4 November 1971, Florentino Centeno was murdered in Sara, Iloilo. His
 wife, Ester Causing received an indemnity of P60.000.00 as the 
beneficiary of his life insurance policy. The persons who were 
responsible for the crime were not prosecuted, and the three accused 
blamed the widow for this. A feeling of enmity developed between them 
particularly because both parties sought to gain control of the 
management of the boat. Nestor Asistido, however, remained loyal to the 
widow, who promised to see him through school, which fact the accused 
inwardly resented.
</p><p>
In the afternoon of 21 November 1971, the father of Nestor, Arsenio 
Asistido, was warned by accused MANUEL Centeno that if he (Arsenio) 
would allow Nestor to stay with Ester, their sister-in-law, they would 
kill him (Nestor) in less than six days. Arsenio told his son about 
MANUEL's threat. Nestor, however, informed his father that if Ester 
could withdraw the proceeds of the life insurance of her husband, she 
would transfer her family to Manila and would also send Nestor to school
 there. That same afternoon, Arsenio went to see Ester and related what 
MANUEL had threatened to do. Ester gave him a letter for the Mayor of 
Ajuy and he was informed afterwards that the matter was already settled 
at a conference before Police Sergeant Vicente Alamon which was attended
 by MANUEL and JUAN, on the one hand, and Arsenio Asistido, on the 
other, where the Sgt. succeeded in making them shake hands.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding, the following day, 12 November 1971, Arsenio Asistido 
met accused FRANCISCO Centeno, and the latter told him, "Tay Arsing last
 night your house where your son is living and your house in the 
seashore was being guarded." The next day, Arsenio and FRANCISCO met 
again in the house of Augusto Leonides, the Secretary of the Mayor, and 
FRANCISCO said to him, "Tay Arsing, you were fortunate last night that 
you did not come out of your house."
</p><p>
At noon of 1 December 1971, Nestor was in the house of his parents at 
Barrio Malayuan. He set the table for his father, who, after taking his 
lunch, left immediately for school where he was serving as janitor. 
Between 1:00 to 2:00 o'clock that afternoon, Nestor went to the house of
 Capid (Inocencia Basa) and Esteban Matulac <em>alias</em> "Tiban" which
 was near the beach of Malayuan where the M/V Evelyn HI was docked. He 
played bingo with Jesus Artesilla, Capid and her two sons and Rodel 
Sariya. Not long after, the three accused arrived, FRANCISCO was armed 
with a shot gun, JUAN Centeno, with a .38 caliber pistol, and MANUEL, 
with a greasegun. They called Nestor, and when the latter did not come 
out, MANUEL and JUAN went up the house while FRANCISCO remained 
downstairs. Thuds were heard and Nestor cried out, "Manong Totok I am 
not going to fight back." The people inside the house jumped out except 
Jesus Artesilla. The brothers, JUAN and MANUEL dragged Nestor to the 
door and pushed him towards the stairs. As they did so, FRANCISCO 
Centeno fired his gun at Nestor; the latter was hit and fell to the 
ground. Then JUAN and MANUEL fired their guns at him. FRANCISCO then 
turned to the people around and threatened them not to reveal to anyone 
what had happened. Eyewitnesses to the incident in the house were Jesus 
Artesilla, who was one of the bingo players, and a tuba gatherer of 
JUAN, Teofisto Domegillo, a fish vendor, who happened to be in the 
vicinity to buy fish (t.s.n., p. 4, Tauro) Pedro Nobleza, who was also 
there to sail for Negros in the M/V Evelyn III, (t.s.n., p. 27, CM. 
Tauro) and Bienvenido Brabo who had a house nearby. Scared, all of them 
left after the occurrence.
</p><p>
JUAN and MANUEL thereafter dragged the body of Nestor towards aplace 
where tall grasses grew near the house of Bienvenido Bravo. At about 
5:00 o'clock that same afternoon, Jesus Artesilla, while atop a coconut 
tree gathering 'tuba" saw the body of Nestor Asistido in a supine 
position. He went down the tree and approached the body and saw that it 
was already lifeless. He even closed the eyes of Nestor. Panfilo Besana 
also saw the body of the victim at about 5:30 that same afternoon when 
he went to the cogon grasses to answer a call of nature.
</p><p>
At about 8:00 o 'clock in the evening, the three accused together with 
Jesus Artesilla and Bienvenido Brabo moved the body of Nestor Asistido 
from the tall grasses. The accused ordered Artesilla and Bravo to wrap 
the body in a fishing net owned by Bravo. Then JUAN and MANUEL loaded 
the body in a banca and peddled towards the sea. They returned to shore 
about 4:00 o 'clock the following morning without the body of Nestor, 
which was never recovered.
</p><p>
The respective defense of the accused is alibi. FRANCISCO maintained 
that from 30 November 1971 to 3 December 1971, he contracted the 
services of 14 laborers to pull grasses, transplant seedling and clean 
the canals of his farm, which is in sitio Tigbao Centeno, two kilometres
 away from Barrio Malayuan. He alleged that he and his hired laborers 
worked in the farm from 7:30 in the morning to 4:00 o'clock in the 
afternoon on 1 December 1971, and that he never left the field. In fact,
 they had their lunch there, which was prepared by his wife and another 
woman.
</p><p>
In his turn, JUAN claimed that from 26 November 1971 he plowed his field
 which is situated at Sitio Bitac, one kilometer away from Barrio 
Malayuan. He stated that, on the day of the incident or 1 December 1971,
 he was at his ricefield managing the transplanting of the rice 
seedlings, and that he never left the field until 5:00 o'clock in the 
afternoon of that day.
</p><p>
Accused MANUEL, for his part, claimed that on 1 December 1971 he painted
 the motorboat M/V Evelyn III which was docked about 350 meters from the
 house of Esteban Matulac where the incident occurred, from 7:00 o'clock
 in the morning to 4.00 o 'clock in the afternoon. He likewise alleged 
that he never left his job because they were being watched by Custodio 
Flores, who was in charge of the repair of the boat.
</p><p>
The three accused likewise contended that the witnesses for the 
prosecution testified for monetary considerations and upon instigation 
of their sister-in-law Ester Causing. Their testimonies as to their 
respective alibi were corroborated by Rafael Sumatra and Florenio 
Gonzales for FRANCISCO, by Rolando Gisangro for JUAN, and by Custodio 
Flores for MANUEL.
</p><p>
After trial on the merits, the lower court ruled out treachery and 
evident premeditation and held the accused guilty, not of Murder, but of
 Homicide, in a judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Francisco Centeno, 
Juan Centeno and Manuel Centeno guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
homicide defined and penalized in Art. 249 of the Revised Penal Code, 
with the aggravating circumstance that advantage was taken of superior 
strength which is offset by the mitigating circumstance of voluntary 
surrender, and applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law
 hereby sentences each of them to suffer an imprisonment of not less 
than SIX (6) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>prision mayor</em>
 as minimum, to not more than FIFTEEN (15) YEARS, SIX (6) MONTHS and 
TWENTY ONE (21) DAYS of reclusion temporal, as maximum, with all the 
accessory penalties provided by law, to indemnify Arsenio Asistido and 
Nenita C. Asistido, the heirs of the deceased, the sum of P12,000.00 for
 the death of Nestor Asistido and in addition thereto the sum of 
P33,696.00 for the loss of income, plus P10.000.00 for moral damages and
 to pay the costs."
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
From said decision, the three accused have interposed this appeal on the following Assignments of Error:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> " 1. The trial Court erred into believing the testimonies of 
witnesses characterized by queerness and incredibility as they are and 
narration of witnesses who came out to testify against the 
accused-appellants eight months after the alleged incident and erred to 
assume by probabilities and accused-appellants were responsible for the 
death of Nestor Asistido. </p>
  <p> "2. The trial Court erred in finding the accused-appellants guilty
 of the crime charged despite improbabilities and the absence of <em>corpus delicti</em>."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From the facts established, We find this appeal without merit.
</p><p> 
In all crimes against persons in which the death of the victim is an 
element of the offense, there must be satisfactory evidence of the fact 
of death and the identity of the victim. That a crime has been 
committed, which is what <em>corpus delicti</em> really means, (People 
v. Sanchez, 89 Phil. 423[1951]  and there is evidence linking the 
accused to the crime, has been dearly and positively established by the 
testimonies of four eyewitnesses to its commission. That it was 
committed at the place testified to by those witnesses is substantiated 
by the findings of Capt. Balaois, who conducted an investigation, 
showing the pool of blood inside the house of Inocencia Basa; the traces
 of blood leading to a bigger pool of blood at the foot of the stairs 
(Exhibits B, B-1 to B-5); and the blood trails which showed that the 
body of the victim was dragged through rice paddies and coconut grove 
until the trail was finally lost. <em>Corpus delicti</em>, therefore, 
has been dearly established. The failure of the prosecution to produce 
the body of the victim does not imply the absence of <em>corpus delicti</em>
 (Peoplev. Mones,58 Phil. 46 (1933) for the term does not refer to the 
body of the murdered person (People v. Taruc, et als., G.R. No. L-183 
08, April 30, 1966, 16SCRA834).
</p><p>
The appellants, however, assail the credibility of prosecution witnesses
 in that they testified against them eight months after the incident. 
Notwithstanding, this factor will not assist the defense any for it has 
been held that the initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer 
information about a criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved
 in or dragged into a criminal investigation is common and has been 
judicially declared not to affect credibility (People v. Estocada, 75 
SCRA 295[1977]). Moreover, there is evidence on record showing that 
prosecution witnesses were being threatened by the appellants, one of 
whom is a Barrio Captain, consequently, they were afraid to report to 
the authorities what they knew about the incident. Witness Jesus 
Artesilla even transferred his residence to Carlos, Iloilo, for fear of 
his life. It was only afterthe declaration of martial law that he 
summoned courage to reveal what he had seen (T.s.n., February 13,1973, 
pp. 4 and 25). Witness Teofisto Demegillo also admitted that he was 
afraid of the Centeno brothers. 
</p><p>
In fact, the mother of the victim, Nenita Asistido, had to seek the 
assistance of the Philippine Constabulary
to get the witnesses and to prevent the appellants from threatening them
 (Exhibit "G"), so much so that the latter had to be kept in the PC 
stockade for a time.
</p><p>
Nonetheless, eyewitness Pedro Nobleza informed the victim's mother of 
the occurrence so that in the same afternoon of December 1, 1971, the 
father, Arsenio, reported to the Mayor that the three accused had killed
 his son; while on December 3,1971, the mother, Nenita, reported to the 
police that the accused had shot their son to death (Exhibit "3").
</p><p>
The defense challenges the credibility of eyewitness Teofisto Demegillo 
on the ground that he is a relative of the deceased. It is well-settled,
 however, that relationship <em>per se</em> does not necessarily render 
the testimony of a witness incredible. Besides, the same witness 
testified that the appellants are his godbrothers (ts.n., October 17, 
1972, p. 21). In fact, he even called them "Igsoon" meaning "brother."
</p><p>
Eyewitness Pedro Nobleza's testimony is also assailed as a mere 
reiteration of Teofisto Demegillo. However, each of them happened to be 
at the scene of the crime under different circumstances. Demegillo, as a
 fish vendor, had to buy fish. While Nobleza intended to take the boat 
and sail for Negros. Their testimonies are corroborative of the other, 
and are further strengthened by those of Jesus Artesilla and Bienvenido 
Bravo, two other eyewitnesses.
</p><p>
Panfilo Besana's testimony is also denounced as inconsistent when he 
said that the incident "happened a long time ago but up to the present 
it is not known." However, that was followed immediately by his 
statement "I told them that one time when I went to answer the call of 
nature, I saw the cadaver (t.s.n., December26,1972,p.42). The witness 
must have been referring, therefore, to knowledge by the community, but 
as to himself, he knew about the crime because he actually saw the 
cadaver when he went to answer the call of nature.
</p><p>
And as to the presence of rocks or spades in the banca, all that Jesus 
Artesilla declared was that he did not see any, but not that accused 
JUAN and MANUEL did not carry any rocks or spades in their banca when 
they took the body of the victim with them out to sea.
</p><p>
The fact that Capt. Balaois testified that he was not sure that the 
trail of blood was human blood will not serve to destroy his 
credibility, but on the contrary enhances it for he truthfully said that
 he was not an expert on that.
</p><p>
And while it may be that when the father of the victim, Arsenio , 
Asistido, went to the scene of the crime in the afternoon of December 1,
 1972, he did not find his son's body, this may be explained by the fact
 that it was almost dark when he and his party went so that there was 
little chance of locating the victim's body ; which was1 hidden among 
tall cogon grasses. It was only the investigation the next day by Capt. 
Balaois that disclosed the traces of blood (Exhibits B, B-1, B-6).
</p><p>
In the last analysis, the conclusions reached by a trial Court on the 
question of credibility is entitled to great weight, and should 
ordinarily be respected as it is in a better position to determine such 
matters, unless a fact or circumstance of weight or influence has been 
overlooked and its significance misinterpreted (People v.  Monteverde, 
L-31177, July 15,1976, 72 SCRA 69). We find the required exceptions 
absent herein. The testimonies of prosecution ; witnesses are straight 
forward and consistent on material points, the ' contradictions and 
inconsistencies pointed out by the defense trivial and insignificant, 
such that we can see no reason to disturb the conclusions reached by the
 trial Court in so far as their credibility is concerned.
</p><p>
The defense of each the appellants in this case is that of alibi. It is 
fundamental that this must be supported by clear and convincing evidence
 to be given full faith and credence. Alibi is not 1 credible when there
 appears no physical impossibility on the part of those invoking it to 
have been at the scene of the crime (People 1 v. Estocado, 75 SCRA   
295[1977]). In this case, appellant FRANCISCO was only two kilometers 
away from the situs of the  incident, JUAN, one kilometer, and MANUEL, 
350 meters away.
</p><p>
It was not impossible for them, therefore, to have left their alleged I 
places of work or activity and to have gone to the house where they 
committed the offense. Besides, the rule is also well-settled that alibi
 cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by 
competent witnesses whose credibility is unassailable.
</p><p>
We come now to the nature of the crime committed. The trial Court 
categorized it as Homicide. We disagree. As aptly pointed out by the 
Solicitor General, whose views. We hereby adopt, the circumstances of 
treachery and evident premeditation are clearly attendant herein. Thus,
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The Information charging the accused of Murder notes the 
attendance of two qualifying circumstances - treachery and evident 
premeditation. According to the Revised Penal Code, there is treachery 
'when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing 
means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and
 specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from
 the defense which the offended party might make' (Article 14, par. 6, 
Revised Penal Code). In short, two conditions must concur: (1) the 
employment of means, method or manner of execution which would insure 
the offenders' safety from any defensive or retaliatory act on the part 
of the offended party, which means that no opportunity is given the 
latter to do so (People v. Casalme, 17 SCRA 717[1966]); and (2) that 
such means, method, or manner of execution was deliberately or 
consciously chosen (People v. Dadis 18 SCRA 699[1966]) . </p>
  <p> "In the case at bar, the treacherous manner in which the victim 
was killed is manifest from the record. Nestor Asistido was mauled by 
Juan Centeno and Manuel Centeno inside Basa's house, despite his 
protestations that he was not going to fight back. When he was already 
weak, bloodied, and unable to defend himself, he was dragged to the 
door. Juan and Manuel Centeno held him on both hands. While he was being
 pushed down the stairs, Francisco Centeno fired his gun at him. It 
should further be noted that the victim was unarmed, in contrast to the 
accused who were each armed with firearms. Nestor Asistido was a young 
man of nineteen (19) years. He was no match for three robust men like 
the accused. The fact that the accused went to the place of Basa fully 
armed, is an indication that the means of execution they employed was 
deliberate or consciously chosen. After Francisco fired his gun at the 
victim the latter fell to the ground. Yet, Juan and Manuel Centeno still
 fired their guns at the fallen victim. All the earmarks of alevosia are
 present in this case. We cannot see how anyone else can arrived at a 
different conclusion. </p>
  <p> "We also submit that the aggravating circumstance of evident 
premeditation has been proven in this case. The plan of the accused to 
kill Nestor Asistido made itself manifest as early as November 21,1971. 
On said date Manuel Centeno informed Arsenio Asistido that if he would 
allow his son Nestor to stay with Ester Causing, they would kill Nesior 
in less than six (6) days. (pp. 5-6. tsn., October 17, 1972). It is true
 that the Mayor of Ajuy tried to settle matters between the Asistido's 
on the one hand and the accused Centeno's on the other hand. The accused
 Juan and Manuel Centeno appeared cordial during their confrontation, 
but the subsequent events that followed show that the accused have not 
desisted from their original plan to kill Nestor. The following day, 
when Arsenio Asistido met Francisco Centeno, the latter expressed their 
original threat, (pp. 6-7, tsa, October 17, 1972). The same threat was 
reiterated once more by Francisco Centeno on November 23, 1971. On 
December 1, 1971, the accused went to the house of Inocencia Basa, fully
 armed. There is no showing that they went to this place for any reason 
other than to kill Nestor Asistido. The continuity of these events, 
buttressed further by the treachery employed to kill the victim, show 
the persistence of the accused to carry out the criminal intent they had
 originally hatched. (People v. Tapitan, 27 SCRA 959). Sufficient time 
had lapsed from November 21,1971, when the intent of the accused to kill
 made itself manifest for the first time, until December 1, 1971, when 
the crime was committed. This had given the accused sufficient 
opportunity to reflect and deliberate upon the consequences of their 
act. All these characterize the aggravating circumstance of evident 
premeditation." (Appellee's Brief, pp. 18-20) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Treachery being present, the aggravating circumstance of abuse of 
superior strength appreciated by the trial Court can no longer be 
considered as a separate generic aggravating circumstance since it must 
be deemed absorbed in treachery.
</p><p>
As to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the same is 
not home out by the evidence. By their own admission, appellants were 
arrested by the authorities (t.s.n., June 19, 1973, p. 75,  November 
5,1973, p. 54). They never made any attempt to give themselves up prior 
to their arrest nor to save the authorities from any trouble in their 
search and capture. On the contrary, FRANCISCO and JUAN even tried to 
evade the processes issued to them to secure their presence during the 
preliminary investigation conducted by the Special Counsel (Exhibits A, 
A-l, 1-A). With respect to MANUEL, who was studying in Manila, the 
records show that the prosecution had already presented its evidence 
against FRANCISCO and JUAN before MANUEL was allegedly informed by his 
lawyer of this criminal charge against him such that prosecution 
witnesses had to be recalled to the stand to testify on his 
participation in the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  Therefore, the crime committed was that of murder and in the absence 
of any mitigating aggravating circumstance the penalty which should be 
imposed is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Accordingly, this Court finds accused-appellants Francisco Centeno, Juan Centeno <em>alias</em> Totok and Manuel Centeno <em>alias</em> Iyao guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and hereby sentences each to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>,
 to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the victim Nestor 
Asistido the sum ofP12,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
 insolvency, and to pay the costs. In view of the penalty thus imposed 
and pursuant to the guidelines laid down in People v. Daniel, G.R. No. 
L-40330, November 20,1978, let this case be certified to the Supreme 
Court for review."
