The accused, Rogelio de Jesus y Quizon appeals from the decision of the 
Circuit Criminal Court, First Judicial District in its Criminal Case No.
 CCC-1-80, Isabela (II-329) finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt, 
of the crime of rape as defined and penalized under Article 335, 
paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code and sentencing him, after 
appreciating in his favor the mitigating circumstance of voluntary 
surrender, to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, to indemnify the
 offended party Clara Mina y Simon in the amount of P10,000.00 plus 
another P5,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages, without subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.
<p>
The facts are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Clara Mina, an unmarried woman of 28, lived with her parents in barrio Amistad, Alicia, Isabela (p. 7, tsn., March 21, 1974). </p>
  <p>
  Clara Mina, however, is feeble-minded.  She is unable to comb her 
hair, bathe herself and wash her clothes (pp. 21, 31, 32, tsn., March 
21, 1974).  Because of her mental condition, she just stayed in the 
house, doing no household chores (p. 31, tsn., Id.).
  </p>
  <p>
  The accused, Rogelio de Jesus, a 19-year old farmer, who lived in the 
house of his sister some 15 meters away from the victim's house, knew of
 Clara's mental infirmity, and has often seen her left alone in the 
house (p. 20, tsn., March 21, 1974; pp. 38, 47, 49, tsn., April 25, 
1974).
  </p>
  <p>
  At about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon of Jan. 3, 1974, Pastora Simon 
went out to the field in order to plant palay, leaving her daughter 
Clara Mina alone in the house.  Her husband (Clara's father), had gone 
to a place called Soliven four days before, while the other members of 
the household had also left for the field (pp. 17, 18, 19, tsn., March 
21, 1974).
  </p>
  <p>
  That afternoon, Clara Mina was seated on top of a trunk when Rogelio 
de Jesus suddenly entered the house, carried her in his arms and laid 
her on the floor (pp. 8, 13, tsn., March 21, 1974).  Objecting to what 
was being done to her, Clara gave an outcry 'Madi! Madi!' (which 
translated means 'I don't like! I don't like!') Rogelio, ignoring her 
cries, removed her panties as well as his own trousers.  He lay on top 
of her, inserted his penis into her vagina and performed the sexual act 
(pp. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, tsn., Id.).
  </p>
  <p>
  Meanwhile, Pastora Simon, who had already walked some 150 meters away 
from their house, when sensing it was about to rain, hurried back to the
 house to get cellophane with which to shield her from the rain (p. 17, 
tsn., March 21, 1974).  Upon her return to the house, she found Rogelio 
de Jesus naked lying on top of Clara Mina whose legs were spread apart 
(p. 19, tsn., Id.).  Seeing them in that position, she rushed to the 
kitchen to get a club but Rogelio spotted her and ran away.  (p. 20, 
tsn., Id.).
  </p>
  <p>
  The barrio captain, Glicerio Guzman, to whom Pastora Simon had 
immediately reported the incident, looked for Rogelio but failed to 
locate him (p. 20, tsn., March 21, 1974; pp. 10, 20, tsn., March 22, 
1974).
  </p>
  <p>
  Returning from the barrio captain's house, Pastora Simon investigated 
Clara, who revealed to her that she was carried away from the trunk 
where she was seated, then forcibly laid on the floor to have sexual 
intercourse with Rogelio (pp. 20, 21, tsn., March 21, 1974).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The next day - January 4, 1974 - Clara Mina, accompanied by her parents,
 denounced Rogelio de Jesus to the police authorities (p. 20, tsn., 
March 22, 1974).  Clara Mina was examined by Fernando Babaran, Municipal
 Health Officer of Echague, Isabela at the Southern Isabela Emergency 
Hospital, the municipal health officer of Alicia being then on leave (p.
 6, tsn., March 22, 1974).  The medical certificate, Exhibit "C", issued
 by Dr. Babaran, shows the following findings:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    '(1)  hymenal lacerations at 3 o'clock 8 o'clock and 11 o'clock
  </p>
  <p>
    (2)  vagina admits one finger with ease.  Two fingers with difficulty.
  </p>
  <p>
    (3)  fresh perineal abrasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    (4)  smear, not done due to lack of microscope.
  </p>
  <p>
    (5)  contusion - left temporal area.  Lesions to heal within one week.' (p. 3, Record).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to Dr. Babaran, the abrasions were possibly inflicted the day 
prior to the examination and that the contusion on the left temporal 
area of the girl's head could have been caused when her head was pushed 
against a hard object (pp. 11, 12, tsn., March 22, 1974).
</p><p>
Subsequently, Rogelio de Jesus was surrendered by his brother-in-law, a 
councilor, to the Alicia Police Department.  He executed an affidavit, 
Exhibit "D" subscribed before Alicia Municipal Judge Flor Egipto on 
January 5, 1974, admitting that he has sexual intercourse once with 
Clara Mina, but denying that he raped her (p. 7, record)."
</p><p>
The accused denied that he had forced the complainant to have sexual 
intercourse with him and that he only inserted his forefinger inside the
 complainant's private parts.  He testified that he admitted having 
sexual intercourse once with complainant in his affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  because of maltreatment employed upon him by the jail guards.
</p><p>
While the affidavit executed by the accused is not admissible in 
evidence for lack of evidence showing that the accused during the 
custodial investigation was apprised of his constitutional rights under 
Art. IV, Sec. 20, of the New Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  still there is sufficient evidence on record that the accused had performed the sexual act, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  The accused testified that he merely inserted his forefinger 
into the complainant's vagina to cure her of her mental malady.  The 
records, however show, from the testimony of both the prosecution and 
the defense, that the accused laid on top of complainant.  If 
appellant's purpose was merely to insert his forefinger into the 
complainant's vagina, then there is no necessity of lying on top of 
complainant.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  Complainant testified, contrary to the testimony of the accused,
 that the latter brought out his penis and inserted it into her vagina 
which pained her a lot.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  The hymenal lacerations and the fresh perineal abrasions in 
complainant's vagina corroborated her testimony that the accused had 
sexual intercourse with her.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The accused assailed the competence of the complainant as a witness on 
the ground that being feeble-minded she is not a competent witness in 
contemplation of the rules and therefore her testimony should have been 
rejected by the lower court.  That the complainant was feeble-minded and
 had displayed difficulty in comprehending the questions propounded on 
her is an undisputed fact.  However, there is no showing that she could 
not convey her ideas by words or signs.  It appears in the records that 
complainant gave sufficiently intelligent answers to the questions 
propounded by the court and the counsels.  The court is satisfied that 
the complainant can perceive and transmit in her own way her own 
perceptions to others.  She is a competent witness.
</p><p>
Having sexual intercourse with a feeble-minded woman is rape.  The 
offense is described under paragraph 2 of Article 335 of the Revised 
Penal Code, that is, the offender having carnal knowledge of a woman 
deprived of reason.  The Court, in the case of <em>People vs. Daing</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The offense committed by appellant is rape described under 
paragraph 2 of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, that is, the 
offender having carnal knowledge of a woman deprived of reason.  The 
deprivation of reason contemplated by law does not need to be complete. 
 Mental abnormality or deficiency is enough.  So it was held by the 
Supreme Court of Spain that a man having carnal knowledge of a woman 
whose mental faculties are not normally developed or who is suffering 
from hemiplegia and mentally backward or who is an idiot commits the 
crime of rape.  x x x"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Being feeble-minded, complainant is incapable of thinking and reasoning 
like any normal human being, and not being able to think and reason from
 birth as aforesaid, and undoubtedly devoid or deficient in those 
instincts and other mental faculties that characterize the average and 
normal mortal, she really has no will that is free and voluntary of her 
own; hers is a defective will, which is incapable of freely and 
voluntarily giving such consent so necessary and essential in lifting 
coitus from the place of criminality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  In this connection, the Solicitor General properly stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That complainant possesses such a low mental capacity, to the 
extent of being incapable of giving consent, could be gleaned from the 
fact, as testified to by her mother, that she is unable to do the simple
 tasks of combing her hair and bathing herself.  Thus, even granting it 
to be true, as counsel has insinuated, that complainant had submitted to
 the sexual act without resistance (p. 9, Appellant's Brief) such cannot
 be construed as consent on her part, so as to preclude it from being 
rape.  Incapable of giving consent, she could not thus consent in 
intelligently."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>

WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED in toto.
