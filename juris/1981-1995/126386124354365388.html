decision of the Court of Appeals in AC-G.R. CV No. 01016 entitled, "<span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span>,
Plaintiff-Appellant v. <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Ronsales</span>,
et al., Defendants-<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>," dated January 28,
1986 affirming the decision of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial
Court) of Iloilo; and its resolution dated September 11, 1986 denying the
motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject matter of the present controversy is a 260 square
meter parcel of land which, according to petitioners, is included in the parcel
of land purchased by their predecessor, <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span>, from Simeon <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>; but
contradicted by the private respondents by claiming it as their own evidenced
by a certificate of title issued in their favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We gathered from the records that the
questioned land is the eastern portion allegedly included in the parcel of land
purchased from Simeon <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court ruled in favor of the <span class="GramE">private</span> respondents on the grounds of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>,
absence of fraud in the registration of the questioned land and
prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was affirmed
by the respondent court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, <span class="GramE">We</span> affirm, based on the first two grounds but not on the
ground of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The antecedent facts are
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It appears that on May
14, 1946, Simeon <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span> bought a parcel of land from
Loreto Martinez, <span class="SpellE">Presentacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Jereza</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Hermenigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jereza</span>, Maria
Luz <span class="SpellE">Nele</span> <span class="SpellE">Jereza</span> and Maria
Elena <span class="SpellE">Jereza</span>, situated within the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of Jordan, Sub-Province of <span class="SpellE">Guimaras</span> with an area of
5,031 square meters and bounded on the North by Jordan River, Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> and <span class="SpellE">Custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>; on the East by Roman Catholic Church and the
Municipality of Jordan; on the South by <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span>
Martinez; and on the West by Jordan River.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The above-described parcel of land was then declared for taxation
purposes under Tax </span>Declaration No. 6437.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This land was later on sold by Simeon <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span> in
1948.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On May 15, 1962, Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Castem</span>, Rolando <span class="SpellE">Iranaya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Iranaya</span> sold a parcel of
land which they inherited from <span class="SpellE">Custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>, situated in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of Jordan, Sub-Province of <span class="SpellE">Guimaras</span>, with an area of
1,011 square meters and bounded on the North by Jordan River; on the East by
Roman Catholic Archbishop of <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span>; on the South by
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Gaylan</span>; and on the West by Jordan River, to <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The land was then declared for taxation
purposes under Tax Declaration No. 4135.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the same year, <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span>
bought another parcel of land from the heirs of Rafael <span class="SpellE">Gaylan</span>,
situated in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of Jordan, Sub-Province of <span class="SpellE">Guimaras</span>, with an area of 1,750 square meters and bounded
on the North and East by the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>; on the South by Simeon <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>;
and on the West by Jordan River, and declared for taxation purposes under Tax
Declaration No. 3638.</p>

</span><span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span> had
the three lots consolidated after the survey into one lot, and Tax Declaration
No. 7688 was issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondents claim that the
questioned land was formerly owned by <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and was </span>declared

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">An action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> has its basis in Section 53, paragraph 3 of

pursue all his legal and equitable remedies against the parties to such fraud

the prescriptive period for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of

the municipality.</blockquote>
