considering that a sufficient time elapsed between the inception of their
concerted plan and its fulfillment, for each of them to dispassionately reflect

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The State's brief of </span><st1:date year="1974" day="25" month="3"><span style="">March
 25, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, supports
this finding of the trial court by arguing that, "The circumstance of
evident premeditation is therefore very patent in this case, it being clear
that the assailants were previously armed with deadly weapons and their assault
was a concerted one thereby producing a group action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was sufficient lapse of time between
the determination to kill their victims and the actual execution thereof to
allow them to reflect and meditate upon the consequences of their acts."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evident premeditation as
a qualifying circumstance requires proof of the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the time when the offender determined to
commit the crime; (b) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit </span>had
clung to his determination; and (c) a sufficient lapse of time between the
determination and the execution of the crime to allow him to reflect upon the
consequences of his act and to allow his conscience to overcome the resolution
of his will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People
v. <span class="SpellE">Beralde</span>, L-32832, June 29, 1979, 91 SCRA 125,
citing a long line of cases.)</span> These elements cannot be inferred from the
mere fact that the accused acted in concert.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, an examination of the written statements of the
appellants do not disclose that they specifically agreed in the evening of May
3, 1969, to kill members of the rival Sputnik gang the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, they could not have done so for there
is no proof in the record that the appellants knew that on May 4, 1969, members
of the Sputnik gang were to be transferred from Dormitory 5-B to Dormitory 4-D.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>True, all of the written statements
spoke of getting even with the members of the Sputnik gang but such statements
do not prove evident premeditation in the contemplation of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that they prove is the existence of a
gang war between the Sputnik and Commando gangs where revenge or retaliation
would be a natural element.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For evident
premeditation to qualify the killing there should have been proof that the
appellants had met the night before, discussed among themselves, and agreed to
kill their rivals the following morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record is bereft of evidence in this regard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the appellants were forearmed with bladed weapons
does not prove evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For in the light of the gang rivalry, it was to be expected that the
members of the opposing gangs would arm themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our opinion the appellants merely took advantage of an
opportunity which was suddenly offered to them to kill their rivals in the
morning of <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Was there treachery?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have to answer in the affirmative because the attack made by the appellants was
sudden and unexpected such that it insured the accomplishment of their
intention without any risk to them arising from the defense which the victims
might have offered.</p>

<p class="BODY">From their extra-judicial confessions, the appellants themselves
state that when the members of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>
Sputnik gang were passing in front of the main gate of Dormitory 4-C which the
appellants occupied, on their way to Dormitory 4-D, members of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span> Commando gang suddenly rushed from their
dormitory and with improvised bladed weapons they attack the Sputniks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was corroborated by Prison Guard Pedro
Palparan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1969</st1:date>, he was ordered to escort
prisoners from Dormitory 5-B to Dormitory 4-D when, "The prisoners from
4-C ambushed the prisoners we were going to transfer." <span class="GramE">(TSN,
January 29, 1973, p. 12.)</span> And on cross-examination he admitted that the
ambush "was made in an abrupt manner." <span class="GramE">(Id., p.
18.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is manifest that the sudden and simultaneous attack on the
unarmed and unsuspecting victims was one which they could not have reasonably
expected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it was made under
conditions which made it impossible for them to mount an effective
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, treachery was present
during the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Counsel for the appellants also assail</span>
the application of Art. 160 of the Revised Penal Code by the trial court
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"5<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> accused <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>
Lucas, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
Adriano <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Echavez</span>, Ernesto Torres, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>,
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Pomida</span>, Federico <span class="SpellE">Pariente</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Casillar</span> and
Pablo Reyes (insofar as Criminal Case Nos. 2008 and 2011 are concerned), are
each liable for three separate crimes of murder which is punishable by reclusion
temporal in its maximum period to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appearing that all of them were serving prison sentences at the time
they committed these offenses, the maximum of the said penalty shall be imposed
upon each of them pursuant to the provisions of Article 160 of the Revised
Penal Code." <span class="GramE">(Decision of May 2, 1973.)</span> It is
claimed there was no proof that the appellants were serving sentence by final
judgment at the time of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this point we quote with approval the reply of the Solicitor General:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the instant case, the prison records
of the accused-appellants, which were not objected to by the defense when
presented by the prosecution, show that all of them were serving prison
sentences upon conviction by final judgment at the time they committed these
offenses (Exhibits "II", "II-1" to "II-14",
Folder of Exhibits of joint trial; Exhibits "I" and "J",
Folder of Exhibits of separate trial against <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span>
and Reyes).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense is claiming now
for the first time that the prison records are not admissible in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is too late to raise such issue now
because the appellants had all the opportunity to object to its admission in
the lower court but they failed to do so (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
Oct. 26, 1972)."</p>

<p class="BODY">Lack of instruction is claimed by the appellants as a mitigating
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True none of them had gone
beyond the elementary level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we are
not inclined to disturb the action of the trial court in denying them this alternative
mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Magpantay</span>, 12 SCRA 389 [1964].)</span>
For illiteracy alone will not constitute such circumstance; it must be
accompanied by lack of suffi­cient intelligence and knowledge of the full
significance of one's act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. Geronimo, 53 SCRA 246 [1973].)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants also claim that the surrender of their weapons to the
prison authorities should be considered as a mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that we are not prepared to
consider surrender of weapons as analogous to voluntary surrender to a person
in authority or his agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
there is nothing in the record to show that the surrender was made voluntarily
or with spontaneity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the
surrender of the weapons did not take place where the incident took place but
in Dormitory 4-C which was occupied by the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a separate brief, dated November 13, 1974, filed for <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span> only, it is
prayed "that the judgment of the trial court x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> convicting <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span> be reversed and a new one be rendered acquitting
him on grounds of reasonable doubt; or, in the alternative, if this Honorable
Court finds that he is liable for the deaths of Alberto <span class="SpellE">Rubiso</span>,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Trijo</span> and Jaime Caballero, that he should be
convicted only of multiple homicide as the Trial Court improperly appreciated
against him the aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident
premeditation."</p>

<p class="BODY">In urging the acquittal of <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span>, his
counsel leans heavily on <span class="SpellE">Lambino's</span> testimony during
the trial that at the time of the stabbing incident he was inside Cell No. 4 of
<span class="GramE">Dormitory</span> 4-C and that although he was a member of the
<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span> Commando group he did not join his <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span> in attacking the Sputniks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Barin</span> likewise testified that during the incident <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span> was with him at the "<span class="SpellE">pasillo</span>"
outside Cell No. 2 of Dormitory 4-C playing mahjong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as the trial court said and we
agree:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"These testimonies, however,
cannot prevail over the fact that the aforesaid accused confessed his
participation in the attack as shown by his written statements, Exhibits F and
F-1, F-2 and F-3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no
evidence whatsoever that was adduced by the accused to show that the
confessions were extracted <span style="">from him
through force or intimidation, the presumption that they were voluntarily given
must stand."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons we have already adduced, we also find <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span> guilty of three
(3) counts of murder qualified by treachery and with the aggravating
circumstance of quasi-recidivism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was no evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgments of the trial court convicting each of the
appellants of three counts of murder are hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we cannot affirm the death sentences
for lack of the required number of votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some members of the court including the undersigned believe that the
sub-human conditions which prevailed at the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prisons at the time of the incident were largely responsible for the brutalization
of the inmates therein and because of such fact the imposition of the death
penalty is not warranted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgments of the trial court are hereby
modified in that each of the appellants is sentenced to three (3) <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> for three separate crimes of murder
