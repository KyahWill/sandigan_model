				<BR><STRONG>MELENCIO-HERRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Accused-appellant, Wilfredo Parilla, alias "Willy", appeals his conviction of the crime of Rape, on two counts, by the Regional Trial Court of Davao, Branch III, which imposed on him the penalty of "reclusion perpetua for each of the crimes charged, to be serve simultaneously, and to pay the offended party P20,000.00 in concept of moral damages."<br><br>The prosecution evidence shows that on April 12, 1980, at about 5:00 P.M., complainant Flora Batulan, then 12 years of age, together with her 11-year old sister Corazon, her 12-year old cousin Alexander Cenita, and a friend 13-year old Juanito Lumuntad, were asked by Flora's father to bring fish to her uncle, whose house was about a kilometer away from their own.&nbsp; After the delivery, and after they were halfway home at about twilight, the four children noticed that Appellant, aged 45 years, then wearing a red shirt and black pants and carrying a scythe, was behind them.&nbsp; Not long after, Appellant threw stones at them.&nbsp; The four ran towards home.&nbsp; Appellant, however, caught up with Flora, who could not run fast because she had just been released from the hospital after a bout with hepatitis.&nbsp; Instantaneously, Appellant lifted Flora, covered her mouth, told her not to shout or else she would be killed, took her to the bushes, and raped her.&nbsp; Flora lost consciousness as a result.&nbsp; When she regained consciousness, Appellant was by her side and dragged her towards a rubber tree.&nbsp; Flora struggled to free herself but to no avail.&nbsp; Appellant succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her for the second time.&nbsp; Thereafter, Appellant brought Flora to a trail leading to her house.&nbsp; Upon arriving home, she immediately told her aunt of the outrage on her person.&nbsp; Flora's father was out at the time looking for her after the three children had told him that Appellant had pulled her to the bushes.&nbsp; Upon his arrival, however, Flora immediately told him of her defloration.<br><br>A medical examination conducted the same day showed "1. Hymen ruptured; 2. Presence of whitish fluid fishy in odor located at the posterior and anterior formix of the uterus; 3. Loss of virginity".<br><br>Appellant denied the charges and imputed the commission of the crime to Noling Dimpas, his cousin.&nbsp; The Trial Court aptly summarized his defenses as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x.&nbsp; He claimed it was his cousin, Noling Dimpas, who committed the acts he was charged of and that he could not have committed them (the supposed crimes) at the time material to their commission as he was then at the camarin, owned by his landlord where he and his family lived, drinking tuba with Albino Ablen, the landlord, and Tomas Espillarga.&nbsp; In elaborating on his defenses, the accused claimed that Noling Dimpas in fact went to him at the camarin asking for money and shoes because he had committed a crime; that the Barangay Captain of Mamunga, Nato Saludares accompanied by ICHDFs in fact traced him (Noling Dimpas) to the camarin; and that no less than said Barangay Captain (Saludares) told him that his cousin, Noling Dimpas, raped the complainant, reason why they were looking for him.&nbsp; And to strengthen the alibi, the accused presented Danilo Ignacio, a convict actually serving sentence, who represented himself as a businessman and a resident of Monkayo, Davao.&nbsp; This witness testified that he was together at the camarin of Albino Ablen with the accused and Albino Ablen that afternoon of April 12, 1980, first to weigh the pig of Albino and, thereafter, and after the accused had gathered tuba upon instructions of Albino, to drink tuba; that after 8:00 o'clock in the evening of that day, Noling Dimpas arrived, fetched the accused, went (both of them) behind the camarin.&nbsp; Afterwards, Barangay Captain Saludares, with companions, arrived and asked for Noling Dimpas; that the said Barangay Captain told Albino Ablen and him that Noling Dimpas had raped the daughter of Nonoy Batulan; and that they - Ablen, he and the accused - continued drinking after Barangay Captain Saludares and party left, he leaving the drinking bout at about 10:00 o'clock that evening."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>Appellant's defenses, however, were rejected by the Trial Court in a judgment promulgated on February 13, 1984 finding him guilty as charged.<br><br>In this appeal, Appellant submits:<br><blockquote><center>"I<br></center><br>"That the prosecution has not proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and;<br><center><br>"II<br></center><br>"That the lower Court erred in not considering the defense of the accused."</blockquote>Appellant assails the credibility of prosecution witnesses Flora, her sister Corazon, and cousin Alexander, and contends that neither one of them could have identified him as the perpetrator of the crime because it was already dark at the time of the alleged incident.&nbsp; The evidence negates that claim.<br><br>There can be no doubt that Flora could recognize her molestor.&nbsp; She knew Appellant quite well as he was a neighbor and she used to see him pasturing a carabao not far from her house, a fact which Appellant himself admitted.&nbsp; As Flora had testified, she saw Appellant clearly because, at that time, it was still bright.&nbsp; So much so that at the first opportunity, upon arriving home, she disclosed the molestation and identified the culprit, first to her aunt and then to her father.&nbsp; She reiterated her identification of Appellant in her sworn statement to the police two days after and when confronted with Appellant, she readily pointed to him as the rapist.<br><br>Two eyewitnesses, Flora's companions, corroborated her testimony.&nbsp; Alexander Cenita was precise when he declared:<br><br><table Â ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">What, if any, transpired while you were on your way home from the house of Cadio Pisquera?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Wilfredo Parilla stoned us, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Will you give the name?<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">He already mentioned Wilfredo Parilla.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">FISCAL:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Where was Wilfredo Parilla at that time he threw stones to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">He was behind us, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">If this Wilfredo Parilla is in Court, will you point to him?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The man with red shirt (Witness pointing to accused Wilfredo Parilla).<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What did you do when Parilla threw stones to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">We ran and when I looked back, I already saw him holding and covering the mouth of Flora, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Aside from, by the way, when you said Flora, are you referring to Flora Batulan?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Aside from covering the mouth of Flora with his hand, what else did Wilfredo Parilla do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">He brought her to the bushes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">How?<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">WITNESS:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">He lifted her and covered her mouth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>From this witnessâ testimony, it is clear that he saw Appellant lifting and covering Flora's mouth and taking her to the bushes.&nbsp;
