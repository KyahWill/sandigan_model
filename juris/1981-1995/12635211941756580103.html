This case is about the same issue which was resolved against the <em>Iglesia </em>ni
 Cristo and is, therefore, res judicata:  that, as a corporation sole, 
(1) it is not entitled to register lands under section 48 (b) of the 
Public Land Law, which refers only to Filipino citizens, and (2) that it
 is disqualified under section 11, Article XIV of the Constitution to 
hold alienable public lands except by lease.  (Republic vs. Villanueva, 
G. R. No. 55289, June 29, 1982, 114 SCRA 875; Republic vs. Gonong, G. R.
 No. 56025, November 25, 1982, 118 SCRA 729; Republic vs. Court of 
Appeals, G. R. No. 59447 and Republic vs. Cenda単a, G. R. No. 60188, 
December 27, 1982, 119 SCRA 449 and Republic vs. Court of First Instance
 of Nueva Ecija, L-35273, July 25, 1983, 123 SCRA 516.)
<p>
The <em>Iglesia</em> on November 6, 1976 filed an application for <em>confirmation</em>
 and registration of its title over two parcels of land located at 
Barrio Calabaca and the poblacion of Capalonga, Cainarines Norte with 
areas of 300 and 599 square meters used as sites of its chapels.
</p><p>
The town lot was purchased by the <em>Iglesia</em> on May 30, 1955 from 
Josefina Diezmo who in turn purchased it from Esteban Arcea who had used
 the lot for residential purposes since 1920.  The realty taxes had been
 paid up to the time Diezmo possessed the lot.
</p><p>
The Calabaca lot was purchased by the <em>Iglesia </em>on July 18, 1973 
from Basilio Parale who inherited it from hit father Simeon.  It used to
 be coconut land.  Simeon possessed the lot since 1920 and used it for 
residential purposes.  He paid realty taxes on the land.
</p><p>
The <em>Iglesia </em>and its predecessors claimed to have actual, 
public, peaceful, continuous and uninterrupted possession of the two 
lots in the concept of an owner for more than thirty years preceding the
 filing of the application.  No realty taxes were paid by the <em>Iglesia </em>because it is an exempt corporation.
</p><p>
The Director of Lands opposed the application.  The trial court in its 
decision of April 30, 1982 granted it, confirmed the title of the 
applicant and ordered the lands registered "<em>in the name of Iglesia ni Cristo, with its Executive Minister Era単o G. Manalo, as corpo足ration sole</em>, with office and postal address at corner Central and Don Mariano Marcos Avenues, Diliman, Quezon City, Metro Manila".
</p><p>
The Republic appealed under Republic Act No. 5440 in relation to Rule 45
 of the Rules of Court.  The trial court found, and it is a matter of 
judicial notice, that the <em>Iglesia </em>"is a duly registered 
corporation sole" (Exhs. E and F).  As the application is for 
confirmation of an imperfect or incomplete title, that application is 
necessarily subject to the follow足ing provisions of the Public Land Law,
 Commonwealth Act No. 141:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 48.  The following described <em>citizens</em> of the 
Philippines, occupying lands of the public domain or claiming to own any
 such lands or an interest therein, but whose titles have not been 
perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of First Instance of the 
province where the land is located for confirmation of their claims and 
the issuance of a certificate of title therefor, under the Land 
Registration Act, to wit: </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p> (b)    Those who by themselves or through their predecessors in 
interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious 
possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, 
under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership, for at least thirty
 years immediately preceding the filing of the application for 
confirmation of title except when prevented by war or force majeure.  
These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the 
conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a 
certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter."

  <p> (c)    x x x<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style=""></span>                                          x x x<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style=""></span>                                         x x x."
  </p>
  <p> "SEC. 49.  No person claiming title to lands of the public domain 
not in possession of the qualifications specified in the last preceding 
section may apply for the benefits of this chapter."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <em>Iglesia </em>is not a Filipino citizen.  The lands in question 
are still public lands until registered (Heirs of Pelagio Zara vs. 
Director of Lands, 127 Phil. 8).  Moreover, under the aforecited section
 11 of Article XIV, it is disqualified as a corporation to hold lands of
 the public domain except by lease.  (Manila Electric Company vs. 
Castro-Bartolome, L-49623, June 29, 1982, 114 SCRA 799; Director of 
Lands vs. Lood, L-32521, September 2, 1983, 124 SCRA 460).
</p><p>
The <em>Iglesia </em>in its appellee's brief has not shown that it is 
not covered by the said constitutional and statutory provisions.  Its 
statement on page 2 of its brief that it "is not a religious 
corporation" when its application is belied by the facts.
</p><p>
It contends that it is entitled to register the lands as a trustee.  
This contention is erroneous.  The unarguable fact is that it is a 
corporation sole governed by section 109 <em>et sequitur </em>of the Corporation Code.  It did not apply for registration as a trustee.
</p><p>
As stated at the outset, the matter is subject to the governing principle of <em>stare decisis et non quieta movere</em> (follow past precedents and do not disturb what has been settled).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the trial court's decision is reverse and set aside and the <em>Iglesia</em>'s application is dismissed with costs against it.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro</em>, and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar,</em> J.<em>, (Chairman</em>), reiterates his dissent in the cited cases.
