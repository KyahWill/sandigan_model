The validity of the search warrant issued by respondent Judge (not 
reappointed) is challenged by petitioner for its alleged failure to 
comply with the requisites of the Consti­tution and the Rules of Court.
<p>
Specifically, the contention is that the search warrant issued by 
respondent Judge was based merely on the application for search warrant 
and a joint affidavit of private respondents which were wrongfully it is
 alleged subscribed, and sworn to before the Clerk of Court of 
respondent Judge.  Furthermore, there was allegedly a failure on the 
part of respondent Judge to attach the necessary papers pertinent to the
 issuance of the search warrant to the records of Criminal Case No. 
4298-CC wherein petitioner is accused under PD 810, as amended by PD 
1306, the information against him alleging that Soriano Mata offered, 
took and arranged bets on the Jai Alai game by "selling illegal tickets 
known as 'Masiao tickets' without any authority from the Philippine Jai 
Alai &amp; Amusement Corporation or from the government authorities 
concerned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
Petitioner claims that during the hearing of the case, he discovered 
that nowhere from the records of the said case could be found the search
 warrant and other pertinent papers connected to the issuance of the 
same, so that he had to inquire from the City Fiscal its whereabouts, 
and to which in­quiry respondent Judge replied, "it is with the court". 
 The Judge then handed the records to the Fiscal who attached them to 
the records.
</p><p>
This led petitioner to file a motion to quash and annul the search 
warrant and for the return of the articles seized, citing and invoking, 
among others, Section 4 of Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Court.  The 
motion was denied by respon­dent Judge on March 1, 1979, stating that 
the Court has made a thorough investigation and examination under oath 
of Bernardo U. Goles and Reynaldo T. Mayote, members of the Intelligence
 Section of 352nd PC Co./Police District II INP; that in fact the court 
made a certification to that effect; and that the fact that documents 
relating to the search warrant were not attached immediately to the 
record of the criminal case is of no moment, considering that the rule 
does not specify when these documents are to be attached to the records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid order having 
been denied, he came to this Court, with the instant petition, praying, 
among others, that this Court declare the search warrant to be invalid 
and all the articles confiscated under such warrant as inadmissible as 
evidence in the case, or in any proceedings on the matter.
</p><p>
We hold that the search warrant is tainted with illegality for being violative of the Constitution and the Rules of Court.
</p><p>
Under the Constitution "no search warrant shall issue but upon probable 
cause to be determined by the Judge or such other responsible officer as
 may be authorized by law after examina­tion under oath or affirmation 
of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce".  More emphatic and
 detailed is the implementing rule of the constitutional injunction, 
Section 4 of Rule 126 which provides that the judge must before issuing 
the warrant personally examine on oath or affirmation the complainant 
and any witnesses he may produce and take their depositions in writing, 
and attach them to the record, in addition to any affidavits presented 
to him.
</p><p>
Mere affidavits of the complainant and his witnesses are thus not 
sufficient.  The examining Judge has to take depositions in writing of 
the complainant and the witnesses he may produce and to attach them to 
the record.  Such written deposition is necessary in order that the 
Judge may be able to properly deter­mine the existence or non-existence 
of the probable cause, and to hold liable for perjury the person giving 
it if it will be found later that his declarations are false.
</p><p>
We, therefore, hold that the search warrant is tainted with illegality 
by the failure of the Judge to conform with the essential requisites of 
taking the depositions in writing and attaching them to the record, 
rendering the search warrant invalid.
</p><p>
The judge's insistence that she examined the complainants under oath has
 become dubious by petitioner's claim that at the particular time when 
he examined all the relevant papers connected with the issuance of the 
questioned search warrant, after he demanded the same from the lower 
court since they were not attached to the records, he did not find any 
certification at the back of the joint affidavit of the complainants.  
As stated earlier, before he filed his motion to quash the search 
warrant and for the return of the articles seized, he was furnished, 
upon his request, certified true copies of the said affidavits by the 
Clerk of Court but which certified true copies do not bear any 
certification at the back.  Petitioner likewise claims that his xerox 
copy of the said joint affidavit obtained at the outset of this case 
does not show also the certification of respondent judge.  This doubt 
becomes more confirmed by respondent Judge's own admission, while 
insisting that she did examine thoroughly the applicants, that "she did 
not take the deposition of Mayote and Goles because to have done so 
would be to hold a judicial proceeding which will be open and public",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  such that, according to her, the persons subject of the intended raid 
will just disappear and move his illegal operations somewhere else.
</p><p>
Could it be that the certification was made belatedly to cure the defect
 of the warrant?  Be that as it may, there was no "deposition in 
writing" attached to the records of the case in palpable disregard of 
the statutory prohibition heretofore quoted.
</p><p>
Respondent Judge impresses this Court that the urgency to stop the 
illegal gambling that lures every man, woman and child, and even the 
lowliest laborer who could hardly make both ends meet justifies her 
action.  She claims that in order to abate the proliferation of this 
illegal "masiao" lottery, she thought it more prudent not to conduct the
 taking of deposition which is done usually and publicly in the court 
room.
</p><p>
Two points must be made clear.  The term "depositions" is sometimes used
 in a broad sense to describe any written state­ment verified by oath; 
but in its more technical and appropriate sense the meaning of the word 
is limited to written testimony of a witness given in the course of a 
judicial proceeding advance of the trial or hearing upon oral 
examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  A deposition 
is the testimony of a witness, put or taken in writing, under oath or 
affirmation before a commissioner, examiner or other judicial officer, 
in answer to interlocutory and cross interlocutory, and usually 
subscribed by the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  The searching questions propounded to the applicants of the search 
warrant and his witnesses must depend to a large extent upon the 
discretion of the Judge just as long as the answers establish a 
reasonable ground to believe the commission of a specific offense and 
that the applicant is one authorized by law, and said answers 
particularly describe with certainty the place to be searched and the 
persons or things to be seized.  The examina­tion or investigation which
 must be under oath may not be in public.  It may even be held in the 
secrecy of his chambers.  Far more important is that the examination or 
investigation is not merely routinary but one that is thorough and 
elicit the required information.  To repeat, it must be under oath and 
must be in writing.
</p><p>
The other point is that nothing can justify the issuance of the search 
warrant but the fulfillment of the legal requisites.  It might be well 
to point out what has been said in Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Co., 
Inc. vs. Herrera:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It has been said that of all the rights of a citizen, few are of 
greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the
 right of personal security, and that involves the exemption of his 
private affairs, books, and papers from inspection and scrutiny of 
others.  While the power to search and seize is necessary to the public 
welfare, still it must be exercised and the law enforced without 
transgressing the constitutional rights of the citizens, for the 
enforcement of no statute is of sufficient importance to justify in 
difference to the basic principles of government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, in issuing a search warrant the Judge must strictly comply with 
the requirements of the Constitution and the statutory provisions.  A 
liberal construction should be given in favor of the individual to 
prevent stealthy encroachment upon, or gradual depreciation of the 
rights secured by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  No presumption of regularity are to be invoked in aid of the process when an officer undertakes to justify it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
While We hold that the search warrant is illegal, the return of the things seized cannot be ordered.  In Castro vs. Pabalan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  it was held that the illegality of the search warrant does not call 
for the return of the things seized, the possession of which is 
prohibited.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the writ of certiorari is granted and the order of March 1, 
1979 denying the motion to annul the search warrant as well as the order
 of March 21, 1979 denying the motion for reconsideration are hereby 
reversed, the search warrant, being declared herein as illegal.  
Notwithstanding such illegality, the things seized under such warrant, 
such as stock of "masiao" tickets; "masiao" issue tickets; bet money; 
control pad or "masiao" numbers; stamping pad with rubber stamp marked 
Ormoc City Jai-Alai," cannot be returned as sought by petitioner.  No 
costs.

SO ORDERED.
