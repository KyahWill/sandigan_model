<p class="BODY">Both appellants are represented by separate counsels, who

<p class="BODY">The statement of facts in the brief filed by the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellants Norberto Quinto and Romeo Ibiaz at the time of the
incident were policemen of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Rosario</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="6">June
 16, 1971</st1:date> at Barrio Sapa, <st1:address><st1:street>Abdilla Street</st1:street>,
 <st1:city>Rosario</st1:city></st1:address>, <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>,
appellants and another person by the name of Renato Diusen alias Dagul stopped
a tricycle (p. 14, t.s.n., March 10, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The three men who were in fatigue uniform <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">(p. </span>17, tsn., March 10, 1972) asked the passenger of the
tricycle, who was later on identified as Vicente Ballestamon, the deceased (p.
15, tsn., March 10, 1972), to alight from the tricycle (Ibid) and to raise his
hands (Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">appellants</span>
policemen then fired successive shots at the deceased (Ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The mother of the deceased upon being informed that her son
had been shot ran to the place of the incident (pp. 16-27, <span class="GramE">tsn.,</span>
<st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon her arrival at the place of the incident
she saw her son lying prostrate on the ground (p. 39, tsn., April 17, 1972) but
his feet were still moving (p. 140, tsn., April 17, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also saw appellants Norberto Quinto and
Romeo Ibiaz and their companion Renato Diusen alias Dagul surrounding her son
(Ibid) and all of them were carrying long arms (p. 41, tsn., April 17,
1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she shouted 'Bakit ninyo
ginanyan ang aking anak' (p. 42, tsn., April 17, 1972) and appellants told her
'Do not meddle here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the command
of the mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Utos ito <span class="GramE">ni</span> mayor, huwag kang makialam dito.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Lumayo ka' (p. 41, tsn.,
April 17, 1972).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the mother
remonstrated that her son should be brought to the hospital as his feet were
still moving (p. 42, tsn., April 17, 1972), appellant Norberto Quinto shot
again her son (pp. 42-43, <span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1972</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The apparent motive for the killing was that the deceased
witnessed the killing of one Lamberto Alcantara by Danny Enriquez, son of the
mayor, and his bodyguards.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was going
to be a witness against them (pp. 44-47, <span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1972</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The deceased suffered eight (8) gunshot wounds (p. 8, tsn.,
March 10, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cause of death was
severe hemorrhage (p. 10, tsn., March 10, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both hands of the victim were subjected to
paraffin test and were found negative for the presence of camphor residue
prints (p. 3, tsn., March 10, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant Norberto Quinto admitted in open court that he
killed the deceased (p. 6, tsn., November 27, 1972).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both appellants went to the municipal building to surrender after
the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1972</st1:date>,
Norberto Quinto alias "Obet", Romeo Ibiaz and Renato Diusen alias
"Dagul" were charged before the Circuit Criminal Court in <st1:city><st1:place>Pasig</st1:place></st1:city>,
Rizal of the crime of murder by District State Prosecutor Cornelio M. Melendres
and Assistant City Fiscal Enrique A. Cube in <span class="GramE">an information</span>
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 16th day of June 1971, in the
Municipality of Rosario, Province of Cavite, and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused NORBERTO QUINTO alias OBET, ROMEO
IBIAZ, and RENATO DIUSEN alias DAGOL, conspiring, confed­erating and mutually
aiding one another without justifiable cause, with deliberate intent to kill,
with treachery and evident premeditation, armed with firearms of different
calibers, taking advantage of their public position; that the wrong done in the
commission of the crime was deliberately augmented by other wrong not necessary
for its com­mission, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
shoot one VICENTE BALLESTAMON y GERON in the different parts of his body
thereby inflicting upon the latter gunshot wounds which directly caused his
instan­taneous death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, Norberto Quinto and Romeo Ibiaz pleaded not
guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other co-accused Renato
Diusen has not been brought to trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
aforesaid, the two:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinto and Ibiaz
were convicted and they appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Norberto Quinto gave the
following assignment of errors, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“I. That the Circuit Criminal Court erred in giving credit and
weight to the false and fabricated testimonies of two prosecution witnesses,
Antonio Giron and Rosalina G. Ballestamon, who are uncle and mother of the
victim;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“II. That the Circuit Criminal Court erred in refusing to give
credit and belief to the legitimate self-defense presented by herein
defendant-appellant;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“III. That the Circuit Criminal Court erred in convicting herein
defendant-appellant in the absence of the proof of his guilt beyond reason­able
doubt."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Romeo Ibiaz made a lone assignment of error, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"that the trial court erred in finding
him guilty of the crime charged."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants claim self-defense, stating that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six o'clock</st1:time> in the late afternoon of <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1971</st1:date>, Lt. Enrique Banzon
told them to go to barrio Sapa, <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city> and to apprehend Vicente
(Boyet) Ballestamon who was making trouble at the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed that Ballestamon was
armed with a long gun and indis­criminately firing shots, Quinto brought with
him, aside from his caliber .38 service <span class="GramE">pistol</span>, an
armalite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ibiaz had at the time his
caliber .45 service pistol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As they
approached the place, they heard a shot followed by another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, Quinto jumped out of the tricycle
they were riding in going to barrio Sapa and turning his head saw the victim,
Boyet Ballestamon, pointing his <span class="GramE">gun</span> at them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="GramE">Ibiaz,</span> overcame with
fear, stayed in the tricycle and, looking at the direction where the shot came
from, saw Ballestamon with his gun pointed at them.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, Quinto, without waiting for Ballestamon to
shoot, fired at the latter inflicting upon him multiple gunshot wounds which
caused his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, the defense contends that Ballestamon was known to be a
police character even before the advent of martial law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They claim that considering his iras­cibility
in the use of guns Quinto immediately fired before he himself would be the
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing of the deceased by appellant Norberto Quinto being
admitted by the latter, the burden of proving that the slaying was legally
justifiable lay upon him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our view of
the evidence discloses that this burden was not adequately met.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, both hands of the
deceased were examined by Major Crispin B. Garcia of the Philippine
Constabulary and they gave "negative results to the test for the presence
of gun powder residue." <span class="GramE">(Exhibit A).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the claim that the deceased was armed
with a carbine and was firing the same shortly before he was shot is not
true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinto's explana­tion about this
consists mainly of speculation, like possible tampering of the specimen or
reference to the rare cases where a person fires a gun and yet his hand is
negative for gunpowder nitrate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, Quinto's claim that empty carbine shells were found in
the vicinity is denied by defense witness, PC Sgt. Mario Genuino, who
testified, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did you do in the vicinity, where you found the victim, and took the carbine
and gave it to Lt. Banzon?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I looked around if I could find any empty
shells.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you find any empty shells?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not find.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Was there any magazine
in the carbine?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How many?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around twenty, but it was a banana type
magazine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Proceed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. DOLORFINO:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were you able to examine the carbine before
you gave that to Lt. Banzon?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were you able to see the contents of the
magazine in relation to the said carbine?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The magazine was tucked in the carbine and
the bullets were jammed in the muzzle of the gun." (<span class="GramE">tsn</span>.
pp. 15-17, <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="10">Oct. 13, 1972</st1:date>
hearing).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Further, Sgt. Genuino declared that when
he arrived at the crime scene there was nobody there except the appellants, Lt.
Banzon and a photographer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The People's
theory that the carbine was placed by the police after the incident could be
true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The photographer was fetched after
the shooting incident and he arrived at the crime scene about <st1:time minute="15" hour="19">7:15</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial court, "the
accused did not allow the people to go near the body of Boyet for almost thirty
minutes, which time was more than enough opportunity for them to place the
carbine beside the body of Boyet."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, the claim of Quinto that prosecution
witnesses Antonio Giron and Rosalina Ballestamon, uncle and mother,
respectively of the deceased, were biased to the point of falsifying and
fabricating evidence against <span class="GramE">them,</span> is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated by the Solicitor General in
his brief:</p>

<blockquote>"The rule on evidence provides that a party or any other
person interested in the outcome of a case may testify (Sec. 18, Rule 130, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the testimony of an interested witness can not be rejected on the
ground of his apparent interest alone, but must be judged on its own merits,
and if the testimony is clear and convincing and not destroyed by other
evidence on record, it may be believed (Carandang vs. Cabatuando, L-25384,
October 26, 1973 citing the case of U.S. vs. Mante, 27 Phil. 134 (1914).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other than their relationship to the deceased
there is no other reason why their testimony should be rejected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To prove justification, the accused must rely on the strength of
his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution, for even
if it were weak, it could not be disbelieved after the accused had admitted the
killing (People vs. Ansoyon, 75 Phil. 772).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first requisite of self-defense is that there should be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">unlawful aggression on the part of the person
injured or killed by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
can be no self-defense in the absence of unlawful aggression (People vs.
Apolinario, 58 Phil. 586).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without it,
the second requisite would not apply since there would be nothing to prevent or
repel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing to defend from
or against and there will be no occasion to require that the means of defense
employed be reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, the appellants failed to sustain this first requisite of
self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim did not have
any firearm at the time he was fired at, slain and killed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We now come to the claim
of appellant Ibiaz that he is not a principal by direct participation or a co­conspirator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He argues that he had no motive to kill
Ballestamon and that the only evidence against him was his passive presence at
the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other­wise
stated, it is his contention that he did not use his gun against the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">This contention of Ibiaz
is contradicted by NBI Dr. Dario Nalagan who testified that from the nature and
extent of the injuries inflicted upon the deceased, at least two (2)
malefactors participated in the killing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Hereunder is the
testimony of Dr. Nalagan on this point:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To establish a conspiracy, it is not essential that there be
proof as to a previous agreement to commit a crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient that the malefactors acted
in concert to attain the same objective (People vs. San Luis, <span class="GramE">86 Phil. 485, 497</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The concurrence of wills, which is the essence of conspiracy, may be
deduced from the evidence of facts and circumstances, which taken together,
indicate that the parties cooperated and labored to the same end (People vs.
Macul, 86 Phil. 423, 426; People vs. Carbonel, 48 Phil. 868, 875).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it is quite clear that appellants, by their acts,
aimed towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They arrived together at the scene of the
crime, in fatigue uniform, as early as <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00</st1:time>
in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing the
victim, they stopped the tricycle he was riding and, thereafter, fired at
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Applying the foregoing rules to
this case, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the assault by the assailants
and their companion against Vicente Ballestamon, as declared by Antonio Giron,
reveals a conspiracy and a tacit understanding to put him out of the way.</p>

evident premeditation and the mitigating cir­cumstance of voluntary surrender,
the penalty that should be imposed on appellants is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
