				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">One wonders why the respondent judge did not immediately grant
the petitioner's motion to quash the information on the obvious and valid
ground that the facts charged did not constitute an offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decisive act could have avoided the
needless molestation of one more citizen and cleared the clogged dockets of
this Court of still another of the persecutions big and small so rampant during
those days of martial law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More
importantly, it would have affirmed once again the freedom of expression
guaranteed in the Bill of Rights to which every one was entitled even under the
1973 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case goes back to <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="4">April

subject of seizure proceedings in the Bureau of Customs but most of them were
ordered released upon proof that the customs duties and other charges thereon

by ASAC men which, from all appearances, constitute criminal offenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I am referring to the raid they conducted on
April 21, 1976 at about 4:30 in the afternoon at Tokyo Hotel, <span class="SpellE">Ongpin</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>, Manila,
pursuant to a "Warrant of Seizure and Detention" (seizure
Identification No. 14922) issued by the Acting Collector of Customs on April <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">20, </span>1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The raiding team, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

alone in her hotel room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ASAC agents,
despite Mrs. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Ng's </span>protest and
claim of innocence, forced their way into the room and ransacked the place for
alleged untaxed goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only did they
take everything they could find in the room, but also forcibly took from her
person the wrist watch and jade bracelet (gold plated) she was wearing at the
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also forced open her handbag
and divested her of her wallet containing 70 <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
dollars, as well as her necklace and her son's wrist watch which she had placed
in said handbag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Ng was also
subjected to the indignities of being searched by a male person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After emptying the </span>room of its
contents, the raiding team presented to her a carbon copy of a list purporting
to show the goods seized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The list,
however, appears not only illegible but does not reflect all the goods that
were taken away by the ASAC agents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
is more, said men, likewise taking advantage of the absence of Mrs. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Ng's </span>son, owner of some of the
articles, falsified the signature of the latter by writing his name on the
space designated as "owner", making it appear that he (Lee <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> Ming) had acknowledged that the list covers all the
items seized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The documents and other papers presented to me by my clients reveal
that the articles seized were declared at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>

It was left to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a

Later, when the petitioner came to this Court and we required a comment from
the Solicitor General, this official complied only after asking for (and

<p class="BODY">The letter comes under Item 1 as it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the ASAC Chairman to complain against the conduct of his men when they raided
the Chinese touristsâ€™ rooms in the Tokyo Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>sent by the

principal purpose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

have by himself caused the publication of such an explosive item.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> showing
that, by some kind of influence he had over the periodical, he succeeded in
having it published to defame the ASAC agents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It does not appear either that the report was paid for like an
advertisement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This looks instead to be
the result of the resourcefulness of the newspaper in discovering matters of
public interest for dutiful disclosure to its readers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be presumed that the report was
included in the issue as part of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">newspaper's

</span>(Emphasis provided)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may also be argued that the complaint, standing by itself, is
a public record and may be published as such under Rule 135, Section 2 of the
Rules of Court unless the court directs otherwise in the interest of morality
or decency.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the matters mentioned in Article 354 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span>as
exceptions to the general rule are not absolutely privileged and are still
actionable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, since what is
presumed is not malice but in fact lack of malice, it is for the prosecution to
overcome that presumption by proof that the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>actually motivated by
malice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent such proof, the charge

<p class="BODY">We <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are </span>not

outright because the prosecution must first be given a chance to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">introduce </span>evidence to overcome the

procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, where it appears
from the allegations in the information itself that the accused acted in good
faith and for justifiable ends in making the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

need to prolong the proceedings to the prejudice of the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court can and should dismiss the charge

<p class="BODY">The two exceptions provided for under Article 354 are based on
the wider guarantee of freedom of expression as an institution of all
republican societies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This in turn is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> predicated on the proposition that the
ordinary citizen has </span>a right and a duty to involve himself in matters
that affect the public welfare and, for this purpose, to inform himself of such
matters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The vitality of republicanism derives from an alert citizenry
that is always ready to participate in the discussion and resolution of public
issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These issues include the conduct
of government functionaries who are accountable to the people in the
performance of their assigned powers, which after all come from the people
themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Every citizen has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>right to
expect from all public servants utmost fidelity to the trust reposed in them
and the maximum of efficiency and integrity in the discharge of their functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Every citizen has a right to complain and
criticize if this hope is betrayed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is no less important to observe that this vigilance is not
only a right but a responsibility of the highest order that should not be
shirked for fear of official reprisal or because of mere civic lethargy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whenever the citizen discovers official
anomaly, it is his duty to expose and denounce it, that the culprits may be
punished and the public service cleansed even as the rights violated are
vindicated or redressed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It can never be
overstressed that indifference to ineptness will breed more <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ineptness and that toleration of corruption
will breed more corruption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sins of
the public service are imputable not only to those who actually commit them but
also to those who by their silence or inaction permit and encourage their
commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The responsibility to review the conduct of the government
functionaries is especially addressed to the lawyer because his training
enables him, better than most citizens, to determine if the law has been
violated or irregularities have been committed, and to take the needed steps to
remedy the wrong and punish the guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents contend that the letter was written by the
petitioner to influence the seizure proceedings which were then pending.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that to be true, such purpose
did not necessarily make the letter malicious, especially if it is considered
that the complaint against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the ASAC
agents could not be raised in the said proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ASAC Chairman, not the Collector of
Customs, had jurisdiction to discipline the agents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should also be noted, as further evidence of lack of malice,
that even after the seizure proceedings had been concluded in favor of the
petitioner's clients, he pursued their complaint against the ASAC agents in the
<span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office in Manila and then with the military
authorities in Camp <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, ending with the filing
of the civil case for damages in the court of first instance of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be a sad day indeed if for denouncing venality <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>government,
the citizen could be called to task and be himself punished on the ground of
malicious<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> defamation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If every accuser were himself to be accused
for discharging his duty as he sees it, then will the wrong-doer have been
granted in effect, and by this Court no less, an undeserved immunity for his
misdeeds or omissions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private
individual would be barred from complaining about public misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Every criticism he makes would be tainted
with malice and pronounced as criminal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The next step may well be a conspiracy among those in the government to
cover up each other's faults and to insulate themselves from the legitimate
efforts of the people to question their conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The second exception is justified under the right of every
citizen to be informed on matters of public interest, which, significantly, was
first recognized in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1973
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if it were not, the
right would still be embraced in the broader safeguard of freedom of
expression, for the simple reason that the right to speak intelligently on
"matters that touch the existing order" necessarily imports the
availability of adequate official information on such matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the exercise of such right cannot
inspire belief if based only on conjectures and rumors and half-truths because
direct access to the facts </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not allowed to the ordinary citizen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This right is now effectively enjoyed with the help of the mass
media, which have fortunately resumed their role as an independent conduit of
information between the government and the people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the recognized duty of the media to
report to the public what is going on in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">government, including the proceedings in any of its departments or
agencies, save only in exceptional cases involving decency or confidentiality when
disclosure may </span>be prohibited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
protect them in the discharge of this mission, the law says that as long as the
account is a fair and true report of such proceedings, and made without any
remarks or comment, it is considered privileged and malice is not
presumed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its publication is encouraged
rather than suppressed or punished.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is one reason why the Court looks with disapproval on
censorship in general as an unconstitutional abridgment of freedom of
expression.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Censorship presumes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">malice at the outset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It prevents inquiry into public affairs and
curtails their disclosure and discussion, leaving the people in the dark as to
what is happening in the public service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">By </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">locking the public portals to the citizen,
who can only guess at the goings-on in the forbidden precincts, censorship
separates the people from </span>their government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This certainly should not be permitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"A free press stands as one of the great
interpreters between the government and the people," declared Justice
Sutherland of the U.S. Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"To allow it to be fettered is to fetter ourselves."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is curious that the ones most obviously responsible for the
publication of the allegedly offensive news report, namely, the editorial staff
and the periodical itself, were not at all <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge was leveled against the petitioner
and, "<span class="SpellE">curiouser</span>" still, his clients who had
nothing to do with the editorial policies of the newspaper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is here a manifest effort to persecute
and intimidate the petitioner for his temerity in accusing the ASAC agents who
apparently enjoyed special privileges - and perhaps also immunities - during
those oppressive times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
non-inclusion of the periodicals was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>transparent hypocrisy, an ostensibly pious
if not at all convincing pretense of respect for freedom of expression that was
in fact one of the most desecrated liberties during the past despotism.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that the information against the petitioner
should never have been filed at all and that the respondent judge committed grave
abuse of discretion in denying the motion to quash the information on the
ground that the allegations therein did not constitute an offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner is entitled to the relief he
seeks from those who in the guise of law and through the instrumentality of the
trial court would impose upon him this arrant tyranny.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the petition is GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The orders of the respondent judge dated <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1977</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1977</st1:date>, are SET ASIDE and
