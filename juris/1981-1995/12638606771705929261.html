<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in 1971, <span class="SpellE">Consing</span> caused the
subdivision of said parcel of land into thirty-eight (38) lots and submitted a
subdivision plan to the Land Registration Commission (LRC) which was approved
on <st1:date year="1971" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1971</st1:date> as a
simple subdivision plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Consing</span> filed a petition for segregation of title and the
issuance of separate certificates of title for the 38 lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same petition, <span class="SpellE">Consing</span>
likewise informed the Register of Deeds that he voluntarily grants the right of

granted and thereafter, doing business under the name <span class="SpellE">Mearle</span>

these 38 lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1971</st1:date>
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Santos and the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> entered into an agreement denominated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a </span>"Contract of Sale"

<p class="BODY">It is stipulated in said "Contract of Sale" that in

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> paid her

her payments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Consing</span>

asking her to settle her obligations which by then have accrued to P12<span class="GramE">,818.61</span>, otherwise, they shall be constrained to resort to
court litigation [Record, p. 12.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>, represented
by a lawyer, manifested her willingness to settle her obligations on the
condition that the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> comply with all the laws
and regulations on subdivisions and after payment to her of damages as a
consequence of the use of a portion of her lot, more or less 168 <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sq.m</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> as
a subdivision road [Record, p. 13.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="7">July
 26, 1974</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case against <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial, on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1974</st1:date>, judgment was rendered by Judge Gregorio
de la Paz of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> in favor
of the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that on August 22, 1974, with the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case still pending, Santos filed with the then
Court of First Instance (CFI) a complaint for specific performance with damages
against the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1975</st1:date>,
the CFI issued a restraining order enjoining the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> from resolving the motion for execution filed by
the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case and from taking further action in said case until further orders from the
CFI [Record, p. 69.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Also borne out by the record is the criminal complaint filed by <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
against Merlin <span class="SpellE">Consing</span> charging him with the crime of
Violation of Municipal Ordinance No. 7, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Series
</span>of 1964 of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>

the approval of the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> for
his subdivision plan [<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span> "1".] On <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="5">May
 21, 1975</st1:date> this complaint was dismissed by the fiscal on the grounds
of lack of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">prima facie </span>case </span>and
prescription [<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"1-b".]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">At about the same time, <span class="SpellE">Consing</span>
submitted his subdivision plan to the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
for approval.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The council, in turn,
referred the same to the Department of Local Government and Community
Development (DLGCD) in compliance with its Memorandum Circular No. 73-41 of <st1:date year="1973" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The DLGCD, in its second <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
dated March 13, 1975, noted that the "subdivision plan meets in general the
requirements in the subdivision regulations of this Office with respect to lot
areas and lot frontages except the street widths which <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">are </span>not indicated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>road lots and which are below the 10 m.
minimum requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore
recommended that the existing roads should be indicated on the plan as road
lots and the corresponding areas along the sides of the said roads as
corrected, be reserved for future road widening and annotated in the title as
such and should be excluded from the sale of the corresponding affected lots. .

"D".]</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1981</st1:date>,
the CFI rendered judgment finding that although the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>
may have "corrected the irregularities and/or [have] complied with the
legal requirements for the operation of their subdivision, they cannot escape
their liability to [<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>] for
having sold to her portions of the roads or streets denominated as
right-of-way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this ground alone, this
Court believes that [<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>] was
fully justified in refusing to pay further her monthly amortizations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the interest of justice, fair play and
equity, this Court believes that there shall be a proportionate reduction of
the purchase price of the two lots corresponding to the area of 168 square
meters, more or less, used as a [right] of way." [Record, p. 485.] The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the CFI decision reads as follows:</p>

already paid by her.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> interposed an appeal to

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED [CA Decision, pp. 12-13.]</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the Court of Appeals, petitioner-spouses
filed this petition for review citing the following reasons why the decision of
respondent court should be reviewed and their petition allowed:</p>

<blockquote>1. The decision rendered by the respondent Court of Appeals in this
case does not comply with the requirements of Article VIII, section 13, of the
New Constitution;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. It is arbitrary and there is no law to support Judge Pineda and
the respondent Court of Appeals in holding that when the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>
constituted a voluntary right of way on Lots 25 and 26, the portions subject to
the right of way ceased to be owned by the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>
and became streets or road lots <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">which
the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> have no right to sell;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. It is arbitrary and contrary to the documented facts for the
respondent Court of Appeals to say that the portions of lots 25 and 26 subject
to a voluntary right of way are actually used as streets or roads even though
it is clearly stated in the lot titles, in the location plans, and in the
contract of sale, that said portions are not streets or roads, but are portions
subject to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> voluntary right of way, and
in spite of the fact that the subdivision was approved by the Land Registration
Commissioner </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a simple
subdivision plan which clearly shows that there are no streets or road lots in
the subdivision.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is arbitrary for Judge
Pineda and the respondent Court of Appeals to suppose that the portions of Lots
25 and 26 subject to right of way are streets or road lots and then compute the
value of the said portions in a careless and erroneous manner, deducting
afterwards the value so computed from the P110,000 purchase price; and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>5. There is no legal or
factual basis in ordering the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> to pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> attorney's
fee to <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
24-25.]</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thereafter, private respondent, as
required by the Court, filed her Answer/Comment to which petitioners filed
their Reply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On May 2, 1988 the Court,
after considering the allegations contained, the issues raised and the arguments
adduced in the pleadings submitted by the parties, gave due course to the
petition [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 84.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners first raise the issue of the Court of Appeals’
non-compliance with the certification requirement under Art. VIII Sec. 13 of
the 1987 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. VIII Sec. 13 of the 1987 Constitution provides that:</p>

<p class="BODY">The first sentence of this provision outlining the
decision-making process of the Supreme Court is adopted from both the 1935<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

Constitutions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter Constitution
further broadened the application of the requirement on the decision-making
process by mandating that this "shall be observed by all inferior
collegiate courts".</p>

<p class="BODY">The certification<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
requirement, however, is a new provision introduced by the framers of the 1987
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its purpose is to ensure
the implementation of the constitutional requirement that decisions of the
Supreme Court and lower collegiate courts, such as the Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and Court of Tax Appeals, are reached after
consultation with the members of the court sitting <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">en banc</b> or in a division before the case is assigned to a member
thereof for decision-writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
decision is thus rendered by the court as a body and not merely by a member
thereof [I Record of the Constitutional Commission 498-500.] This is in keeping
with the very nature of a collegial body which arrives at its decisions only
after deliberation, the exchange of views and ideas, and the concurrence of the
required majority vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence, however, of the certification would not necessarily
mean that the case submitted for decision had not been reached in consultation
before being assigned to one member for the writing of the opinion of the Court
since the regular performance of official duty is presumed [Sec. 5 (m) of Rule
131, Rules of Court.] The lack of certification at the end of the decision
would only serve as evidence of failure to observe the certification
requirement and may be basis for holding the official responsible for the
omission to account therefore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">[S</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">e</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">e </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">I </span>Record of the Constitutional
Commission 460.] Such absence of certification would not have the effect of
invalidating the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second and third assigned errors of petitioners assail the
decision of the Court of Appeals finding that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>portion of Lots 25 and 26, although called a voluntary right
of way, is a subdivision road which they have no right to sell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> argue
that it is a voluntary easement which they have a right to constitute by virtue
of Art. 619 of the New Civil Code and "[b]y constituting and establishing
a voluntary right of way in said two lots, the portions subject to the
voluntary right of way did not become streets or roads as held by Judge Pineda
and the respondent Court of Appeals; they continue to be the property of the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> but subject to an encumbrance, i.e. subject to an
easement of right of way." [Petition, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">p. </span>22; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 27.] Further, the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> contend that "the portions of Lots 25 and 26
subject to voluntary right of way can never be used as streets or road lots
because [their] subdivision plan was approved by the Land Registration
Commissioner as a simple subdivision plan which means that there are no streets
or road lots in the subdivision, otherwise it would not have been approved as
[such]." [Petition, p. 24; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29.] In
fine, the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> are alleging that there is no
basis for the reduction in the purchase price of the two lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
on the other hand, avers that the alleged right of way is actually a
subdivision road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This road <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>included in the two lots sold to
her and she is deprived of the use and enjoyment thereof, hence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>reduction in the purchase price of
said lots is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contentions are devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record negates the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>' assertion that the portions subject to the
voluntary easement of right of way are not roads.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>'
subdivision plan was approved by the LRC as a simple subdivision which
indicated no streets or roads.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
this does not preclude the need for them within the subdivision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>'
subdivision plan reveals that the land is subdivided into 38 lots with the
so-called voluntary right of way cutting across lots 2 and 3, 7 and 6, 8 and 9,
13 and 12, 14 and 15, 19 and 18, 20 and 21, 25 and 24, 26 and 27, 31 and 30, 32
and 33.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The relative position of this
"right of way" <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the lots shows
that it is in fact a road without which the subdivision lot buyers would have
no means of access to and from the subdivision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>heretofore stated, when the Municipal Council referred the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> subdivision plan to the DLGCD, the latter
recommended that the existing roads within the subdivision should be indicated
on the plan as road lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In turn, the
Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> passed Resolution No.
70 approving the subdivision plan of <span class="SpellE">Mearle</span> Homes,
Inc. subject, however, to several conditions one of which is the subdivision
owner's compliance with the recommendation of the DLGCD.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On May 19, 1975, Merlin <span class="SpellE">Consing</span>
wrote a letter addressed to the Municipal Mayor and Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> wherein he admitted that "the road lots as
shown in the plan originally approved by the Land Registration Commission are

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the case at </span>bar,
in including as part of Santos' purchase price the value of the subdivision road,
petitioners have shifted to her the burden of providing for an access to and
from the subdivision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> have thus failed in their duty as subdivision lot
sellers and for such failure and consequent unfairness and injustice to <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
the latter should be entitled to a proportionate reduction in her purchase
price of the two lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-spouses also allege that the CA erred in its
computation of the amount to be deducted from the purchase price of the
lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend that respondent court
had no basis when it made its computation and it merely <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">assumed</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>the price to be deducted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CFI's computation deducted from the total purchase price of
P110<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> the price per square meter of the lots
multiplied by the total area covered by the right of way which is 168 sq.
m.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In arriving at the price per square
meter of the two lots, the trial court divided the total purchase price by the
total area of the two lots, which is <span class="GramE">589 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span>
took exception to this method of computation alleging that the trial court
failed to take into account the value of the bungalow constructed on the lots
and which is part of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals found merit in this allegation and re-computed the price per
square meter of the two lots in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>. . . There is, however, no evidence
showing the price of the land sold, separately from that of the house erected
thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, it may be
reasonably assumed under the circumstances of the case, that one-half (1/2) of
the price of the property corresponds to the house and the other half to the
lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon this assumption, the price per
square meter of the land (with a total area of 589 square meters) may<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>be placed at P93.38, and the price of
168 square meters of right of way at P15<span class="GramE">,687.84</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(instead of P31,375.68 stated in the appealed
decision) which is logically and reasonably deductible from the total purchase
price due from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In consequence, the total reduced purchase
price of the subject property may be fixed at P94<span class="GramE">,312.16</span>
(or P110,000.00 minus P15,687.84).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[CA
Decision, p. 11.]</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the record is bereft of any evidence as regards the price
of the two lots sold to <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
separately from the price of the bungalow constructed thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The exhibits presented by the parties and
their testimonies do not reveal separate valuations of the bungalow and the two
lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evident therefore is the fact that
the purchase price of P110<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is for both the
bungalow <u>and</u> the two lots sold as <u>one</u> property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, to require the parties to adduce
their respective evidence as to the separate valuations of the properties in
question would only serve to unduly delay the disposition of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, the Court of
Appeals’ computation that one-half of the purchase price of P110<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> corresponds to the value of the bungalow and the
other half to the two lots is both just and fair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Court will not disturb the
same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioners allege that "there is no basis for
awarding attorney's fees to [private respondent] <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">in </span>this case because the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> have
not ‘acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy [<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>']
plainly valid, just and demandable claim’ (Art. <span class="GramE">2208, <span class="SpellE">para</span>.</span> 5 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
[Petition, p. 26; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 31.] The evidence on
record, however, proves otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
the <span class="SpellE">Consings</span> have secured the necessary licenses to
operate a subdivision from the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
and the National Housing Authority they, however, exerted the effort to obtain
them only after private respondent filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>complaint for specific performance against
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>heretofore mentioned,
petitioner-spouses constituted an alleged "right of way" over the two
lots sold to private respondent which as the evidence on record reveals was
intended to be a subdivision road occupying <span class="GramE">168 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span></span>. <span class="GramE">of</span> the total 589 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>. <span class="GramE">of</span> the lots sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conduct on the part of the petitioners
clearly shows gross and evident bad faith, not to mention lack of fairness, for
which reason <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the award of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> attorney's fees in favor of private respondent is in
order.</p>
