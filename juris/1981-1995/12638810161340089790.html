<p class="BODY">The operative facts and circumstances surrounding the commission

<blockquote>“<u>EVIDENCE</u>
<u>FOR</u> <u>THE</u> <u>PROSECUTION</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence in chief for the prosecution is articulated through
eight (8) witnesses, namely: Rosalie Zafra, Nenita Tolentino, Dr. Angelo
Singian, Alexander Roman, Antonio Villegas, Renato Abaya, Eduardo Sison and
Pfc. Florencio Munar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shorn of its
unnecessary details, the said evidence tends to prove the following facts:</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The</u> <u>Victim</u>. – The deceased,
Magdalena Juliano y Sultan who was nicknamed Maggie, 30 years old and single,
was employed as a service attendant at the Coffee Shop of the Philippine Plaza
Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has been working there since
the said hotel opened on <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="9">September 27,
 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had for her
closest friends among her co-workers, Rosalie Zafra who was the receptionist in
the coffee shop, and Nenita Tolentino, another service attendant with whom she
boarded in an apartment located at 1827 Tiago Street in Sta. Cruz, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her friendship with these two, Rosalie Zafra
and Nenita Tolentino, was such that she has confided to them her past; that she
once lived with the accused, Cipriano Barba, nicknamed Perry, without the benefit
of marriage, but that she has separated from him because she has found out that
Perry was a married man and with children, and because whenever Perry who was a
heavy drinker, got drunk, he would maltreat her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further confided that she was avoiding
Perry who was then insisting that they resume their living together.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The</u> <u>death</u> <u>of</u> <u>Maggie</u>.
- On the night of <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1977</st1:date>,
the two boardmates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Magdalena Juliano
and Nenita Tolentino, went home together after their tour of duty ended at
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They actually left the premises of the
Philippine Plaza Hotel at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00 o'clock</st1:time>,
<st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, in an owner-type jeep with
one, Exequiel Yuzon, a suitor to <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> and another
named Caloy who was driving the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching the corner of Isagani and Tiago streets, the two girls
alighted and walked home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exequiel and
Caloy then drove away.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The two girls arrived at their apartment at about <st1:time minute="55" hour="0">12:55 o'clock a.m.</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five minutes later, while still on the ground
floor thereof, they heard successive knocks on their door, accompanied by a
man's voice who (sic) introduced himself as 'JIM'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nenita and Magdalena refused to open the door
as house rules forbade them to accept visitors at that late hour and when they
told the caller that they did not know anyone by that name, the insistent
caller continued to knock on the door and announced that he was 'PERRY', x x x
(The caller peeped through the glass jalousie window, moved the curtain aside
through the jalousie and was thus recognized by Nenita to be<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perry Barba who was then wearing a white
polo.) x x x The knocking continued but the girls ignored the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nenita then told <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
to go upstairs, which the latter did, while she went to the comfort room (at
the ground floor).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there Nenita
sensed that somebody went downstairs and opened the door which slammed with a
loud noise when it closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Even while
in the comfort room, Nenita could hear <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> and
Perry quarreling outside.) Getting out of the comfort room, Nenita went
upstairs and saw <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>'s ring, wrist watch and
college ring on the latter's empty bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Through the open window she heard Perry and Maggie talking in loud
voices and a little later, she heard shouts from Maggie asking for help like
‘Aray! Aray! Tulungan ninyo ako!' and other words to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Looking out of the window facing the street,
she saw Perry and Maggie on the sidewalk just outside the gate leading to the
apartment, with Perry (apparently) slapping both sides of Maggie's face with
the latter shouting 'Aray! Aray!' until her view of them became obstructed by
the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she heard people shouting
to the effect that Maggie was stabbed, so she and her other roommates who were
awakened by the shouts, ran downstairs and to the street where they saw Maggie
sprawled and bloodied just outside the gate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dying Maggie was brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Chinese
  General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in a jeep where she was pronounced dead on arrival.</blockquote>

roommate, Pfc. Munar came to know the name of the suspect: Cipriano D. Barba,
nicknamed Perry Barba, a Meralco employee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from Nenita, Munar also questioned Eduardo Sison, Alexander Roman
and Romeo Liongson, who declared that while walking home along Tiago Street,
they noticed a man and a woman quarreling near the gate of a house until the woman
fell to the ground, with the man bending over her and moving his arm up and
down as if boxing her with his fists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The three further told Munar that when they approached the man and the
woman, the man ran away and when pursued by one of them, he threatened the
pursuer (See Exhibit "I") with his knife, saying 'Huwag kang
makialam!' Statements of Nenita Tolentino and Eduardo Sison (See Exhibits
"C" and "I") were taken by Pfc. Munar later during the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Munar also interviewed Antonio Villegas,
barangay chairman, who turned over to him a ball pen with the engraved name
‘PERRY. D. BARBA’ which he claimed was given to him by one, Renato Abaya with
the information that the latter found the same in the premises of the
killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceeding to the scene of the
crime at <st1:street><st1:address>1827 Tiago St.</st1:address></st1:street>,

Villegas himself.</blockquote>

Tolentino as PERRY BARBA, the man who knocked at their apartment door on the
early morning hours of February 10, 1977, and with whom the deceased Magdalena
Juliano had a quarrel a few minutes later.<span style="">&nbsp;

co-attendant in the same coffee shop as well as her roommate in their boarding
house besides<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Rosalie and Nenita, testified among
others on Maggie's love life with Perry Barba; her living with him without the
benefit of marriage; her discovery that he was a married man and with children;
her separation from him; how she has been avoiding him; the insistence of Perry
that they resume their living together; and the fear which she entertained
whenever he is known to be waiting for her to leave the Philippine Plaza Hotel
after her tour of duty late in the evening.</blockquote>

receptionist from a caller who identified himself as Perry Barba of Meralco who
wanted to talk with Maggie, his sweetheart.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In several of these calls, Perry was angry because he was told that service
attendants are prohibited from answering calls over the telephone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion, Perry has berated Rosalie
for hiding Maggie from him in the following manner: 'Putang ina mo, bakit
itinatago mo si Maggie!' (You son of a bitch, why are you hiding Maggie!).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On another occasion he asked Rosalie to tell
Maggie 'Bago siya mapakinabangan ng iba, papatayin ko muna siya!' which,
loosely translated, means, 'Before any one else can have her, I will kill her
first.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rosalie Zafra testified further about an occasion when, before
finishing her tour of duty one night in January, 1977, one of the lady security
guards in the employees' exit and entrance door called on her, saying that a
drunken man was outside who wanted to talk to Maggie over the intercom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosalie gave permission for Maggie to talk
over the intercom and when Maggie was through, she told Rosalie that she was
going to sleep in the hotel because she was afraid of Perry who was waiting for
her outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this occasion, when
Rosalie went home at <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>,
p.m., and as her bag was being inspected, the lady security guard who conducted
the inspection pointed to Perry seated in a taxi cab parked in the parking
lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On her way to her taxi which was
waiting for her, she passed by Perry's taxi and saw the face of the man for the
first time.</blockquote>

Isagani Streets which was near their apartment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the claim of the accused that on February 9, 1977, he left for
Nagcarlan, Laguna, with the knowledge and permission of his wife and came back
to Manila only on February 23, 1977, Pfc. Munar declared the same to be untrue
for the reason that when he interviewed his wife, Dr. Neriza Barba, x x x on
February 10, 1977, that is, the following morning after the killing, Dr. Barba
gave the information that her husband, Cipriano Barba, has not gone home for
quite some time and at the time of the interview, she did not know the
whereabouts of her husband.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Servando Malabute, a member of the team which investigated the
killing of Magdalena Juliano, also debunked the claim of the accused that his
trip to Nagcarlan, Laguna was known to his wife for the reason that when said
wife, a dentist at the Tondo Puericulture Center, was interviewed at her
office, she gave the information that she did not know the whereabouts of her
husband and even gave a written authority (See Exhibit "Q") for the
police officers to enter her home located at 1207 Castañas Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the strength of said authority, the

<blockquote>"Furthermore, the cause or reason that moved and induced him

committing the dastardly act imputed to him in the instant information.</blockquote>

the evidence presented by the prosecution is sufficient to produce that degree
of moral certainty to support a conviction of the accused, Cipriano Barba y
Doria of the crime of murder, qualified by treachery and evident premeditation
committed during the nighttime which he purposely sought the better to
accomplish his criminal intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution has conclusively proven that the accused has threatened to kill the
victim ‘before any one else can have her’ and that, in a sudden, concerned and
unprovoked act, armed with a deadly weapon, stabbed the victim who was
defenseless and unsuspecting.”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

took into account: (a) the clear and positive identification of the accused by
Nenita Tolentino who had seen him at least three (3) times before 9 February
1977 and (b) the lack of sufficient corroboration by persons who could be in a
position to convince the court as to its truth and veracity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More concretely, the trial court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"It will be readily seen that the thrust of the defense is
anchored on alibi, considered as one of the weakest defenses for it is easy of
fabrication (sic) (People v. Raagas, 44 SCRA 152; People v. Mori, 55 SCRA 382;
People v. Derejo, 56 SCRA 554; and People v. Sapatero, 58 SCRA 450), and which
must be looked upon with suspicion (People v. Bondoc, 85 Phil 545).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be sustained in the face of a clear
and positive identification of the accused (People v. Mabuyo, 63 SCRA 532;
People v. Caili, 65 SCRA 24; People v. Bautista, 65 SCRA 460; People .v.
Moises, 66 SCRA 151; and People v. Tizon, 66 SCRA 372), as in this case, where
the accused, Cipriano Barba y Doria was positively identified by Nenita
Tolentino who has seen him at least three times before that fateful night of
February 9, 1977, twice at close range: when Magdalena introduced her to him at
the premises of the Meralco and invited them to eat in a restaurant, a fact
which the accused himself admitted, and when he fetched her and Magdalena from
the Philippine Plaza Hotel and conveyed them in a taxi to the corner of Tiago
and Isagani Streets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, the defense of alibi set up by the accused is not
sufficiently corroborated by persons who could be in a position to convince
this court as to its truth and veracity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For instance, his grandmother, his parents, his friends who supposedly
invited Augusto Carlos to hunt in the hinterlands of Nagcarlan, or his
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is, his wife, Dr. Neriza
Barba, gave the information to the police investigators Munar and Servando
Malabute on the day following the killing that she did not know the whereabouts
of her husband as he has not gone home for quite sometime.</blockquote>

accompanied the accused to Nagcarlan, Laguna is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a city resident to go on a trip to a far

being worn is simply ridiculous and unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And while it may be true that said accused
fled to his hometown in Nagcarlan, Laguna, it must have been after he killed
Magdalena Juliano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such flight gravely

filed by the Solicitor General on 28 December 1979, disagrees with the

nighttime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It argues that even assuming
that the testimonies of Rosalie Zafra and Nenita Tolentino on the motive of the

identity and participation were definitely established by the testimony of

established as Maggie was unsuspecting and unarmed at that time of the
stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the fact that
appellant inflicted 18 wounds on Maggie and that some of those wounds were
caused even after she was already lying on her back with the former on top of
her, proves that the killing was treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It likewise maintains that evident premeditation was sufficiently
established as the records show that barely a week after appellant's threat to
kill Maggie, he was seen in the vicinity of the employees’ exit of the
Philippine Plaza waiting for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
further argues that there is no question that nighttime facilitated the
commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant knew
that in the early morning, the tenants of the boarding house of Maggie would be
sleeping already and that the chances of passers-by witnessing the intended
crime would be very slim; he thus took advantage of the darkness to
successfully consummate his plan.</p>

We are unable to find any explanation why, if indeed this version of the
appellant is correct, the victim should bring the ballpen outside when, as

her things, such as her ring, wrist watch and college ring,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

testified that she saw the appellant on two (2) separate occasions, a month

she, Nenita, joined them in the taxi.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

of the appellant that she met the latter only once, thus:</p>

Tolentino, in the testimony of the accused, he, testifying in his own behalf,

<p class="BODY">The foregoing minor inconsistencies neither destroy the witness’

appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no
reason to disregard her testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled and oft-repeated rule in criminal cases that
minor inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses do not affect their

these discrepancies indicate that the responses were honest and unrehearsed.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Truth to tell, such trivial differences constituted fail-safe reliability
(People v Dollantes, 15 SCRA 592, 603)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having settled the matter of appellant's participation in the
killing of Maggie Juliano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now
address the issue of whether or not the killing was attended by the qualifying
circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation and the generic
aggravating circumstance of nighttime.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, it must be stressed that qualifying circumstances
must not only be alleged in the information but established by direct and
positive evidence as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere
presumption or inferences are not sufficient no matter how logical or probable
they may be.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 16, Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"There is treachery when the offender commits any of the
crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution
thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk
to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the trial court anchors its finding of
treachery on the alleged suddenness of the attack on the unarmed Maggie
Juliano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The People submits as
additional proof thereof the number of wounds -- eighteen (18) in all -- some
of which appellant inflicted on the victim as he continued his attack even as
she was already lying on her back.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Maggie was unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, no positive and direct
evidence to show that the attack was unexpected and sudden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record discloses that no one
actually saw how the attack was commenced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Per Nenita's testimony, as earlier quoted, appellant and Maggie were
talking outside the first time she saw them; a few minutes later, she heard
Maggie shouting "Aray! Aray!." When she peeped at the window, she saw
Perry just "moving his hands backwards and forwards" striking by his
right hand from right to left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
testified to by prosecution witness Alexander Roman, when he saw Maggie and the
man for the first time at the scene of the incident, they were <u>only</u> <u>talking</u>,
and "seemed to be quarreling"; then, as he continued walking, he
heard "shoutings" and so he returned to where the shouts came from
and he saw the man "seemed to be slapping the woman" who was lying
down along the sidewalk; he went nearer, but the man ran away.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Also, in the light of the
revelation of prosecution witness Rosalie Zafra, We are inclined to believe
that the deceased could no longer take in her confidence herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, she was aware of what he
could do to her once he met her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosalie
had informed Maggie of what the appellant told her (Rosalie) over the phone
sometime in January 1977, to wit: "Bago siya mapakinabangan ng iba,
papatayin ko na muna siya" (Instead of others taking her, I will just kill
her).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although Maggie just laughed it
off, she seemed to be afraid whenever the appellant's name was mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one time, when Maggie learned that
appellant was waiting in a taxicab at the parking lot of the hotel, she decided
not to go home but instead sleep in the hotel because she was afraid.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Between the last week of January 1977 and 10 February 1977, Maggie told Rosalie
that she was very Afraid of the appellant because the latter kept on waiting
for her outside.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was likewise established that minutes before Maggie was
killed, appellant kept on knocking successively and loudly at the door of the
apartment where she resided.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, there is indeed a paucity of evidence to show how the
aggression was commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of Maggie
began and developed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>U.S.</u> <u>vs.</u>
<u>Perdon</u><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>

this Court held that where no particulars are known as to the manner in which
the aggression was made or how the act which resulted in the death of the
victim began and developed, it can in no way be established from mere
suppositions that the killing was perpetrated with treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, treachery cannot be considered
where the lone witness did not see the commencement of the assault.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>

convincing evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That the victim sustained eighteen (18) wounds does not by itself
prove treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have been
inflicted after an expected frontal attack preceded by what seemed to be,
according to witness Roman, a quarrel, by a man who was moved by hate after
having been rebuffed in his bid to revive an illicit affair.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree, however, with the trial court and the People that the
qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation was convincingly established
by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>U.S.</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Gil</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled that to justify the inference of deliberate premeditation,
there must be a period sufficient in a judicial sense to afford full
opportunity for meditation and reflection and sufficient time to allow the
conscience of the actor to overcome the resolution of his will if he desires to
hearken to its warning.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Three (3) requisites must, therefore, be duly proved before
evident premeditation may be appreciated as a qualifying circumstance, to wit:
(a) the time when the accused determined to commit the crime, (b) an act
manifestly indicating that the accused has clung to his determination, and (c)
a sufficient lapse of time between such a determination and execution to allow
him to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These requisites must be established with proof as clear as the

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, it was clearly and convincingly shown by the
testimony of Rosalie Zafra that sometime in January 1977, appellant told her
over the phone that: "Instead of others taking her, I will just kill
her." As testified to by Rosalie, which appellant did not care to
seriously object to or categorically deny, appellant was Maggie's former
live-in sweetheart; she, however, separated from him because he is a married
man with children.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>

appellant is a heavy drinker and would beat her whenever he is drunk.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As also correctly summarized by the People in its Brief:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x Barely a week after he made his threat, appellant was
in the vicinity of the Philippine Plaza Hotel particularly at the employee's
exit (p. 30, t.s.n., April. 25, 1977).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant knew exactly where to wait for his victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had cased the joint and it was but
fortunate that Maggie was forewarned of his presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maggie elected to sleep in the hotel that
night because Barba was waiting for her outside.”<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indisputably then, from the time he made known to Rosalie that he
would kill Maggie, until the time he actually killed her, sufficient time had
elapsed to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act and to arrive
at a clear judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he had clung
to his plan to do away with Maggie was positively demonstrated by his
subsequent external manifestations, such as waiting for Maggie outside her
working place and carrying a bladed instrument which, according to Dr. Singian,
may be categorized as a knife,<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
when he went to her apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no doubt that appellant had murder in his heart when he decided to see Maggie
that night of 10 February 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing is thus qualified to murder by evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise agree with the trial court and the People that
nighttime should be appreciated as a generic aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant deliberately sought it either to
prevent him from being recognized or to ensure his unmolested escape.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>

asleep and, therefore, none could witness his deed and that the darkness of
night would facilitate his escape and prevent his identification.</p>

Code is <i><u>reclusion</u></i> <i><u>temporal</u></i> <u>in</u> <u>its</u> <u>maximum</u>
