				<BR><STRONG>FELICIANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case was certified to us by the Court of Appeals in its
resolution dated 11 November 1977 as one involving only questions of law and,
therefore, falling within the <span class="GramE">exclusive</span> appellate
jurisdiction of this Court under Section 17, Republic Act 296, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">In November 1963, Pacific Agricultural Suppliers Inc. (PAGRICO)
applied for and was granted an increase in its line of credit from P400,000.00
to P800,000.00 (the "Principal Obligation"), with the Philippine
National Bank (PNB).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To secure <span class="SpellE">PNB's</span> approval, PAGRICO had to give a good and sufficient
bond in the amount of P400<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, representing the
increment in its line of credit, to secure its faithful compliance with the
terms and conditions under which its line of credit was increased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with this requirement, PAGRICO
submitted Surety Bond No. 4765, issued by the respondent R &amp; B Surety and
Insurance Co. Inc. ("R &amp; B Surety") in the specified amount in
favor of the PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the
Surety Bond, PAGRICO and R &amp; B Surety bound themselves jointly and
severally to comply with the "terms and conditions of the advance line [of
credit] established by the [PNB)".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>PNB had the right under the Surety Bond to proceed directly against R &amp;
B Surety “without the necessity of first exhausting the assets" of the
principal obligor, PAGRICO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Surety
Bond also provided that R &amp; B Surety's liability was not to be limited to
the principal sum of P400,000.00, but would also include "accrued
interest" on the said amount "plus all expenses, charges or other
legal costs incident to collection of the obligation [of R &amp; B
Surety]" under the Surety Bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">In consideration of R &amp; B Surety's issuance of the Surety
Bond, two identical indemnity agreements were entered into with R &amp; B
Surety:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) one agreement dated 23
December 1963 was executed by the Catholic Church Mart (CCM) and by petitioner
Joseph <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>, Jr.; the latter signed not only as
President of CCM but also in his personal and individual capacity; and (b)
another agreement dated 24 December 1963 was executed by PAGRICO, Pacific Copra
Export Inc. (PACOCO), Jose K. Villanueva and Liu <span class="SpellE">Tua</span> <span class="SpellE">Beh</span>; Mr. Villanueva signed both as Manager of PAGRICO and
in his personal and individual capacity; Mr. Liu signed both as President of
PACOCO and in his individual and personal capacity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under both indemnity agreements, the <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>
bound themselves jointly and severally to R &amp; B Surety to pay an annual
premium of P5,103.05 and "for the faithful compliance of the terms and
conditions set forth in said SURETY BOND for a period beginning x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
until the same is CANCELLED and/or DISCHARGED." The Indemnity Agreements
further provided:</p>

<blockquote>"(b) INDEMNITY:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- To
indemnify the SURETY COMPANY for any damage, prejudice, loss, costs, payments
advances and expenses of whatever kind and nature, including [of] attorney's
fees, which the CORPORATION may, at any time, become for, sustain or incur, as
consequence of having executed the above-mentioned Bond, its renewals,
extensions or substitutions and said attorney's fees [shall] not be less than
twenty (20%) per cent of the total amount claimed by the CORPORATION in each
action, the same to be due, demandable and payable, irrespective of whether the
case is settled judicially or <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> and
whether the amount has been actually paid or not;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) MATURITY OF OUR OBLIGATIONS AS CONTRACTED HEREWITH:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The said indemnities will be paid to the
CORPORATION as soon as demand is received from the Creditor or upon receipt of
Court order or as soon as it becomes liable to make payment of any sum under
the terms of the above-mentioned Bond, its renewals, extensions, modifications
or substitutions, whether the said sum or sums or part thereof, have been
actually paid or not.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>We authorize the SURETY COMPANY, to accept in any case and at its
entire discretion, from any of us, payments on account of the pending
obligations, and to grant extension to any of us, to liquidate said
obligations, without necessity of <span class="GramE">previous</span> knowledge
of [or] consent from the other obligors.</blockquote>

SURETY COMPANY on account of the above-mentioned Bonds, its renewals,
extensions or substitutions, either in the belief that the SURETY COMPANY was
obligate[d] to make such payment or in the belief that said payment was
necessary in order to avoid greater losses or obligations for which the SURETY
COMPANY might be liable by virtue of the terms of the above-mentioned Bond, its
renewals, extensions or substitutions, shall be final and will not be disputed
by the undersigned, who jointly and severally bind themselves to indemnify the

<p class="BODY">When PAGRICO failed to comply with its Principal Obligation to
the PNB, the PNB demanded payment from R &amp; B Surety of the sum of
P400.000.00 the full amount of the Principal Obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>R &amp; B Surety made a series of payments to
PNB by virtue of that demand <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P70<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> evidenced by detailed vouchers and receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY">R &amp; B Surety in turn sent formal demand letters to
petitioners Joseph <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>, Jr. and Jose K.
Villanueva for reimbursement of the payments made by it to the PNB and for a
discharge of its liability to the PNB under the Surety Bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When petitioners failed to heed its demands,
R &amp; B Surety brought suit against Joseph <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>,
Jr., Jose K. Villanueva and Liu <span class="SpellE">Tua</span> <span class="SpellE">Beh</span> in the Court of First Instance of Manila, praying
principally that judgment be rendered:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Joseph <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>, Jr. in
his answer maintained that the Indemnity Agreement he executed in favor of R
&amp; B Surety:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)
did not express the true intent of the parties thereto in that he had been
asked by R &amp; B Surety to execute the Indemnity Agreement merely in order to
make it appear that R &amp; B Surety had complied with the requirements of the
PNB that credit lines be secured; (ii) was executed so that R &amp; B Surety
could show that it was complying with the regulations of the Insurance
Commission concerning bonding companies; (iii) that R &amp; B Surety had
assured him that the execution of the agreement was a mere formality and that
he was to be considered a stranger to the transaction between the PNB and R
&amp; B Surety; and (iv) that R &amp; B Surety was <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from enforcing the Indemnity Agreement as against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Jose K. Villanueva claimed in his answer that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) he had executed
the Indemnity Agreement in favor of R &amp; B Surety only "for <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span> purposes" and that it did not express
their true intention; (ii) that the Principal Obligation of PAGRICO to the PNB
secured by the Surety Bond had already been assumed by CCM by virtue of a Trust
Agreement entered into with the PNB, where CCM represented by Joseph <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>, Jr. undertook to pay the Principal Obligation
of PAGRICO to the PNB; (iii) that his obligation under the Indemnity Agreement
was thereby extinguished by <span class="SpellE">novation</span> arising from the
change of debtor under the Principal Obligation; and (iv) that the filing of
the complaint was premature, considering that R &amp; B Surety filed the case
against him as <span class="SpellE">indemnitor</span> although the PNB had not
yet proceeded against R &amp; B Surety to enforce the latter's liability under
the Surety Bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>, however, did not
present any evidence at all to support his asserted defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Villanueva did not submit any evidence
either on his "<span class="SpellE">accomodation</span>" defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court was therefore constrained to
decide the case on the basis alone of the terms of the Trust Agreement and
other documents submitted in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch 24<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the trial court, the

be both objective and subjective (mixed) at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In both objective and subjective <span class="SpellE">novation</span>, a dual purpose is achieved -- an obligation is

<p class="BODY">If objective <span class="SpellE">novation</span> is to take place,
it is imperative that the new obligation expressly declare that the old
obligation is thereby extinguished, or that the new obligation be on every
point incompatible with the old one.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Novation</span> is never presumed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Again, if subjective <span class="SpellE">novation</span> by a
change in the person of the debtor is to occur, it is not enough that the
juridical relation between the parties to the original contract is extended to
a third person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is essential that the
old debtor be released from the <span class="GramE">obligation,</span> and the
third person or new debtor take his place in the new relation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the old debtor is not released, no <span class="SpellE">novation</span> occurs and the third person who has assumed the
obligation of the debtor becomes merely a co-debtor or surety or a co-surety.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above principles to the instant case, it is at once
evident that the Trust Agreement does not expressly terminate the obligation of
R &amp; B Surety under the Surety Bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, the Trust Agreement expressly provides for the
continuing subsistence of that obligation by stipulating that "[the Trust
Agreement] shall not in any manner release" R &amp; B Surety from its
obligation under the Surety Bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can the petitioners anchor their defense on implied <span class="SpellE">novation</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent an
unequivocal declaration of extinguishment of a pre-existing obligation, a
showing of complete incompatibility between the old and the new obligation (and
nothing else) would sustain a finding of <span class="SpellE">novation</span> by
implication.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> But
where, as in this case, the parties to the new obligation expressly recognize
the continuing existence and validity of the old one, where in other words, the
parties expressly negated the lapsing of the old obligation, there can be no <span class="SpellE">novation</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue
of implied <span class="SpellE">novation</span> is not reached at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the trust agreement did was, at most merely to bring in
another person or persons -- the <span class="SpellE">Trustor</span>[s] -- to
assume the same obligation that R &amp; B Surety was bound to perform under the
Surety Bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not unusual in
business for a stranger to a contract to assume obligations <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>;
a contract of <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span> or guarantee is the
classical example.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The precise legal
effect is the increase of the number of persons liable to the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span>, and not the extinguishment of the liability of the
first debtor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in <u>Magdalena Estates vs. <span class="SpellE">Rodrigues</span>,</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that:</p>

<blockquote>"[t]he mere fact that the creditor
receives a guaranty or accepts payments from a third person who has agreed to
assume the obligation, when there is no agreement that the first debtor shall
be released from responsibility, does not constitute a <span class="SpellE">novation</span>,
and the creditor can still enforce the obligation against the original
debtor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In the present case, we note that <u>the <span class="SpellE">Trustor</span></u> under the Trust Agreement, the CCM, <u>was
already previously bound to R &amp; B Surety</u> under its Indemnity
Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the Trust Agreement,
the <span class="SpellE">Trustor</span> also became <u>directly liable</u> to the
<u>PNB</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So far as the PNB was
concerned, the effect of the Trust Agreement was that where there had been only
<u>two</u>, there would now be <u>three</u> obligors directly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> bound in favor of the PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">PAGRICO, R &amp; B Surety
and the <span class="SpellE">Trustor</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the PNB could proceed against any of the
three, in any order or sequence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, PNB never intended to release, and never did release, R &amp; B
Surety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, R &amp; B Surety, which
was not a party to the Trust Agreement, could not have intended to release any
of its own <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span> simply because one of those <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Trustor</span> under
the Trust Agreement, became also directly liable to the PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We turn to the
contention of petitioner Jose K. Villanueva that his obligation as <span class="SpellE">indemnitor</span> under the <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="12">24 December 1963</st1:date> Indemnity Agreement with R &amp; B
Surety was extinguished when the PNB agreed in the Trust Agreement "to
hold in abeyance any action to enforce its claims against [R &amp; B
Surety]".</p>

<p class="BODY">The Indemnity Agreement speaks of the several <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>
"apply[<span class="SpellE">ing</span>] jointly and severally (<u>in <span class="SpellE">solidum</span></u>) to the [R &amp; B Surety] - - - to become
SURETY upon a SURETY BOND demanded by and in favor of [PNB] in the sum of
[P400,000.00] for the faithful compliance of the terms and conditions set forth
in said SURETY BOND - - -".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
part of the Agreement suggests that the <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>
(including the petitioners) would become co-sureties on the Security Bond in
favor of PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record, however, is
bereft of any indication that the petitioners-<span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>
ever in fact became co-sureties of R &amp; B Surety <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span>
the PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners, so far as the
record goes, remained simply <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span> bound to R
&amp; B Surety but not to PNB, such that PNB could not have directly demanded
payment of the Principal Obligation from the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we do not see how Article 2079 of the
Civil Code -- which provides in part that "<u>[a]n extension granted to
the debtor</u> by the creditor without the consent of the guarantor
extinguishes the guaranty" -- could apply in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner-<span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>
are, as it were, second-tier parties so far as the PNB was concerned and any
extension of time granted by PNB to any of the first-tier obligors (PAGRICO, R
&amp; B Surety and the <span class="SpellE">trustor</span>[s]) could not
prejudice the second-tier parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another reason why petitioner Villanueva's contention
must fail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">PNB's</span>
undertaking under the Trust Agreement "to hold in abeyance any action to
enforce its claims" against R &amp; B Surety did not extend the maturity
of R &amp; B Surety's obligation under the Surety Bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Principal Obligation had in fact already
matured, along with that of R &amp; B Surety, by the time the Trust Agreement
was entered into.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners'
obligations under the Indemnity Agreements had, in turn, already similarly
matured, for those obligations were to mature "as soon as [R &amp; B
Surety] <u>became liable</u> to make payment of any sum under the terms of the
[Surety Bond] - - - <u>whether the said sum or sums or part thereof have been
actually paid or not</u>." Thus, the situation was that precisely
envisaged in Article 2079:</p>

<blockquote>"[t]he <u>mere failure</u> on the part
of the creditor <u>to demand payment after the debt has become due</u> does not
of itself constitute any extension of time referred to herein."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The theory behind Article 2079 is that an
extension of time given to the principal debtor by the creditor without the
surety's consent would deprive the surety of his right to pay the creditor and
to be immediately subrogated to the creditor's remedies against the principal
debtor upon the original maturity date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The surety is said to be entitled to protect himself against the
contingency of the principal debtor or the <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>
becoming insolvent during the extended period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The underlying rationale is not present in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has held,</p>

<blockquote>"mere delay or negligence in
proceeding against the principal will not discharge a surety <u>unless there is
between the creditor and the principal debtor a valid and binding agreement <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, one which tends to prejudice [the surety] or to
deprive it of the power of obtaining indemnity</u> by presenting a legal
objection for the time to the prosecution of an action on the original
security.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In the instant case, there was nothing to
prevent the petitioners from tendering payment, if they were so minded, to PNB
of the matured obligation on behalf of R &amp; B Surety and thereupon becoming
subrogated to such remedies as R &amp; B Surety may have against PAGRICO.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The last issue can be
disposed of quickly, Clauses (b) and (c) of the Indemnity Agreements (quoted
above) allow R &amp; B Surety to recover from petitioners even before R &amp; B
Surety shall have paid the PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have
previously held similar indemnity clauses to be enforceable and not <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of any public policy.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners lose sight of the fact that the Indemnity
Agreements are contracts of indemnification not only against <u>actual loss</u>
but against <u>liability as well</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
While in a contract of indemnity against loss an <span class="SpellE">indemnitor</span>
will not be liable until the person to be indemnified makes payment or sustains
loss, in a contract of indemnity <u>against liability</u>, as in this case, the
<span class="SpellE"><u>indemnitor's</u></span><u> liability arises as soon as
the liability of the person to be indemnified has arisen without regard to
whether or not he has suffered actual loss</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, R &amp; B Surety was entitled to proceed against petitioners not
only for the partial payments already made but for the full amount owed by
PAGRICO to the PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">Summarizing, we hold that:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) The Surety Pond was not <span class="SpellE">novated</span> by
the Trust Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both agreements can
co-exist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Trust Agreement merely
furnished to PNB another party obligor to the Principal Obligation in addition
to PAGRICO and R &amp; B Surety.</p>

<p class="BODY">(2) The undertaking of the PNB to "hold in abeyance any
action to enforce its claim" against R &amp; B Surety did not amount to an
"extension granted to the debtor" without petitioners' consent so as
to release petitioners from their undertaking as <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>
of R &amp; B Surety under the Indemnity Agreements; and </p>

<p class="BODY">(3) Petitioners are indemnitors of R &amp; B Surety against both
payments to and liability for payments to the PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The present suit is therefore not premature
despite the fact that the PNB has not instituted any action against R &amp; B
Surety for the collection of its matured obligation under the Surety Bond.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitioners' appeal is DENIED for lack of
merit and the decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioners.</span></p>
