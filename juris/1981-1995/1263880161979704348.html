<p class="BODY">The pertinent background facts as found by the trial court and
adopted by the respondent Court of Appeals in its now assailed decision are the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">The property subject of the controversy is a parcel of land
situated in <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
identified as Lot 6-B of the Subdivision Plan (LRC) Psd-68395, being a portion
of Lot 6 containing an area of 11,095 square meters, more or less.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 6 has an area of 12,799 square meters,
more or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was acquired in 1924 by
the spouses Juan <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> and Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> died in 1936.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On January 11, 1938, Lot 6 was originally registered in the Registration
Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
under Original Certificate of Title No. 4340 pursuant to Decree No. 650247
issued under L.R.C.

Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said lot was sold to Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> through a Deed of Transfer which cancelled O.C.T.
No. 4340 and in lieu thereof T.C.T. No. T-30407 was issued in the name of
Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>.</p>

the trial court rendered its decision (the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“The defense of an innocent purchaser for value would be of no help

and which would be the source of her authority in transferring the subject
property to defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sensible
thing to do by any prudent person is to examine not only the certificate of
title of said property but also all the factual circumstances necessary <span style="">for him to determine if there are any flaw in

<p class="BODY">In elevating the judgment of the respondent Court of Appeals to
Us for review petitioner prays that the appealed decision be reversed and
another one entered declaring as valid (1) the sale of the subject property
executed on June 10, 1970 in favor of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pino</span> by Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>

<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> on July 13, 1970 upon the grounds -</p>

<blockquote>“(<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that private respondents has (sic) no cause of

the subject property from the original registered owners to Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> was valid.” (pp. 61-62, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule applicable to this controversy is well?settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the certificate of title is in the name
of the vendor when the land is sold, the vendee for value has the right to rely
on what appears on the certificate of title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of anything to <span style="">excite
</span>or arouse suspicion, said vendee is under no obligation to look beyond
the certificate and investigate the title of the vendor appearing on the face
of said certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale for
the rule is stated thus:</p>

<blockquote>“The main purpose of the Torrens System is to avoid possible
conflicts of title to real estate and to facilitate transactions relative
thereto by giving the public the right to rely upon the face of a Torrens
Certificate of Title and to dispense with the need of inquiring further, except
when the party concerned had actual knowledge of facts and circumstances that
should impel a reasonably cautious man to make such further inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Capuyoc</span>, 77 SCRA 78) Thus, where innocent third persons
relying on the correctness of the certificate thus issued, acquire rights over
the property, the court cannot disregard such rights.” (Director of Land v. <span class="SpellE">Abache</span>, et al., 73 Phil. 606)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the evidence on record discloses that when
petitioner purchased the subject property on June 10, 1970, the title thereto
(TCT No. T-32683) was in the name of her vendor <u>Rafaela</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Donato</u></span> <u>alone</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said TCT No. T-32683 was shown to petitioner which shows on its face
the following:</p>

provisions of the Land Registration Act in the name of –</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Maguiling</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Umadhay</span>, (33 SCRA 99, 103) this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>“However, while the <span class="SpellE">Umadhay</span> spouses
cannot rely on the title, the same not being in the name of their grantor,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Gumban</span>
stands on a different footing altogether.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time she purchased the land the title thereto was already in the
name of her vendors (T.C.T. 15522).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had the right to rely on what appeared on the face of said title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the record to indicate
that she knew of any unregistered claims to or equities in the land pertaining
to other persons, such as that of herein petitioner, or of any other
circumstances which should put her on guard and cause her to inquire behind the
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the Court of
Appeals she took all the necessary precautions to ascertain the true ownership
of the property, having engaged the services of a lawyer for the specific
purpose and, it was only after said counsel had assured her that everything was
in order did she make the final arrangements to purchase the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court’s conclusion that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Gumban</span>
was a purchaser in good faith and for value is correct, and the title she has
thereof acquired is good and indefeasible.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner paid the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in
consideration of the sale which is fair and reasonable considering that in 1967
<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> paid the
sum of P390.00 for the portion of the land consisting of 1,704 square
meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, however, ruled and this was sustained
by respondent Court of Appeals that petitioner was not an innocent purchaser.</p>

the issuance of the original title on <u>January</u> <u><span style="">11</span>,</u> <u>1938</u> so that the title would be issued in the
names of the heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> and Cicero <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This conclusion is supported (a) by the fact that the subject
property was registered only on <u>January</u> <u>11,</u><span style=""> </span><u>1938</u>, <u>which</u> <u>is</u> <u>around</u>
<u>two</u><span style=""> </span><u>(2)</u><span style=""> </span><u>years</u> <u>after</u> <u>the</u> <u>death</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Juan</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Gaffud</u></span> <u>in</u> <u>1936</u>,
and therefore the title could not have been issued in the name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>; (b) by the fact that the lien imposed by Section 4,
Rule 74, Rules of Court was <u>inscribed</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>face</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>title</u> <u>itself</u>
and was not entered on the Memorandum of Encumbrances as were done with the
mortgages and their releases which were inscribed under their Entry Numbers on
the page for Memorandum of Encumbrances and (c) by the fact that the Original
Certificate of Title was issued in the names of the heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The extra-judicial settlement, therefore, has no bearing on whether
or not there was fraud in the transfer of the subject property to Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it was a <u>Deed</u> <u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Transfer</u> which transferred the subject property from the
original owners to Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> as stated in
Exhibit 3 which is the petition to cancel the conditions imposed by Section 4,
Rule 74, Rules of Court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“That since the time of the execution of the <u>Deed</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u>Transfer</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u>
<u>original</u> <u>owners</u> <u>to</u> <u>herein</u> <span class="GramE"><u>petitioner</u>
<u>in</u><span style=""> </span><u>1967</u>, and also
since the time of the registration of the said <u>transfer</u></span> at
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> - last March 2,
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- <span class="GramE">more</span>
than two (2) years have already elapsed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That from the time of the <u>Deed</u> <u>of</u> <u>Transfer</u>
and within the period of two years thereafter, NO CLAIM WHATSOEVER has been
filed against the herein petitioner with respect to the property <u>thus</u> <u>sold</u>
<u>to</u> <u>her</u>.” (p. 67, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even granting that the extrajudicial settlement was the document
which transferred the subject property from the original owners to Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> the non-production thereof <span style="">(<u>private</u> <u>r</u></span><u>espondents</u> should have presented
it, <u>not</u> <u>petitioner</u>) does not prove that there was fraud committed
in its execution and neither does it prove that petitioner was a party
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no allegation, and
much less any evidence, that the transfer of the subject property from the
original owners to Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> was fraudulent.</p>

<p class="BODY">What private respondents allege as fraudulent was the
extrajudicial settlement of the estate of Juan <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it has been shown that this settlement
was not the basis of the transfer of the subject property to Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>, petitioner’s vendor.</p>

<p class="BODY">That petitioner is an innocent purchaser for value is within the
scope of established jurisprudence.</p>

<blockquote>“The decision of the lower court would set at naught the settled
doctrine that the holder of a certificate of title who acquired the property
covered by the title in good faith and for value can rest assured that his
title is perfect and incontrovertible.” (Benin v. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>,
57 SCRA 531, 581)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Guided by previous decisions of this Court, good faith consists in
the possessor’s belief that the person from whom he received the thing was the
owner of the same and could convey his title (<span class="SpellE">Ariola</span>
v. Gomez <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Serna, 14 Phil. 627).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good faith, while it is always presumed in
the absence of proof to the contrary, requires a well-founded belief that the
person from whom title was received by himself the owner of the land, with the
right to convey it (Santiago v. Cruz, 19 Phil. 148).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is good faith where there is an honest
intention to abstain from taking any <span class="SpellE">unconscientious</span>
advantage from another (<span class="SpellE">Fule</span> <span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Legare</span>, 7 SCRA 351).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, good faith is the opposite
of fraud and it refers to the state of mind which <span style="">is </span>manifested by the acts of the individual concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, private respondents
(petitioner in this case), in good faith relied on the certificate of title in
the name of Fe S. Duran (Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> in this case)
and x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ‘even on the
supposition that the sale was void, the general rules that the direct result of
a previous illegal contract cannot be valid (on the theory that the spring
cannot rise higher than its source) cannot apply here for We are confronted
with the <span class="SpellE">functionings</span> of the Torrens System of
Registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine to follow is
simple enough:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a fraudulent or forged
document of sale may become <span style="">the </span>ROOT
of a valid title if the certificate of title has already been transferred from
the name of the true owner to the name of the forger or the name indicated by
the forger.’” (Duran v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 138 SCRA 489, 494).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Thus, where innocent third persons relying on the correctness of
the certificate of title issued, acquire rights over the property, the court
cannot disregard such rights and order the total cancellation of the
certificate for that would impair public confidence in the<span style=""> certificate of title; otherwise everyone
dealing with property registered under the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
system would have to inquire in every instance as to whether the title had been
regularly or irregularly issued by the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, this is contrary to the evident purpose of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every person dealing with registered land may
safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title issued <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and the law will in no way oblige him to go behind
the certificate to determine the condition of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, an innocent purchaser for

purchaser is not required to explore further <span style="">than what the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> title upon its </span>face
