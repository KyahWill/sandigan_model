				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is an appeal from
the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila declaring permanent the
writ of preliminary injunction issued in this case and con­demning the
defendants (herein appellants) to pay plaintiff (herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>),
the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,152.42</span> with interest thereon at the
legal rate </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">the commencement of this action until fully
paid, P1,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case commenced when <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span> Publications, Inc. brought an action in the
CFI-Manila against Permanent Concrete Workers Union, et al. for the issuance of
a writ of preliminary injunction and for damages it incurred when its employees
were prevented from getting their daily supply of newsprint from its bodega.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff alleged that it
is a second <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> of a part of the premises of
the Permanent Concrete Pro­ducts, Inc. at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">1000 <span class="SpellE">Cordeleria</span>

from the compound of Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. by a concrete and barbed
wire fence with its own entrance and road leading to the national road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This entrance is separate and distinct from
the entrance road of the Permanent Concrete Products, Inc.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff further alleged
that it has a bodega for its newsprint in the sublet property which it uses for
its printing and publishing business.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The daily supply of newsprint needed to feed its printing plant is taken
from this bodega.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="9"><span style="">September
 10, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
employees of the Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. who are representatives and
members of the defendant union declared a strike against their company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 3, 1964 for unknown reasons and without legal
justification, Permanent Concrete Workers Union and its members picketed,
stopped and prohibited plain­tiff's truck from entering the compound to load
newsprint from its bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union
members intimidated and threatened with bodily harm the employees who were in
the truck.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1964</st1:date>,
union members stopped and prohibited the general manager, personnel manager,
bodega in-charge and other employees of the plaintiff from getting newsprint in
their bodega.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff made repeated demands to the defendants not to
intimidate and threaten its employees with bodily harm and not to blockade,
picket or prohibit plaintiff's truck from getting newsprint in their
bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants refused and continued
to refuse to give in to the demands of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence thereof, plaintiff rented another bodega during
the time members of the defendant union prevented its employees from entering
its bodega in the compound of Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. and thus
incurred expenses both in terms of bodega rentals and <span style="">in transporting newsprint from the pier to the temporary bodega.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1964</st1:date>,
the lower court issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the
defendants from:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">threatening</span> and
intimidating plaintiff's executive officers and their representatives, who are
going to its bodega as well as its employees who are getting newsprint from it;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">ordering</span> the
defendants and their representatives not to blockade and/or picket the compound
and the gate of the plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">ordering</span> the
defendants not to stop, prohibit, molest and interfere with the free passage of
the plaintiff in going <span style="">in and out of
the bodega.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendant union moved to
dismiss the complaint on the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That this case arose out of a labor dispute
involving unfair labor practices and, therefore, the Court of First Instance
where this action was brought has no jurisdiction to issue an injunction since
this case falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial
Relations;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff is not the real party in
interest in whose name the present action may be prosecuted in accordance with
Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the first ground,
defendants argued that the Court of Industrial Relations is vested with the
exclu­sive power to issue injunctions in labor disputes involving unfair labor
practices and that in the long line of decisions, the Supreme Court has
repeatedly held that ordinary courts do not have jurisdiction to issue an
injunction in any labor dispute particularly when the Court of Industrial
Relations has already acquired jurisdiction over it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the second ground,
defendants argue that the real party in interest in this case is the Permanent
Concrete Products, Inc. against whom the defendants' strike and picket
activities were directed and confined, and they point to cases between the real
parties in interest, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Permanent
Concrete Products, Inc. on one hand and the Permanent Concrete Workers Union on
the other, pending before the Court of Industrial Rela­tions docketed </span><span style="">therein as </span><span style="">CIR Case No. 156-Inj., Charge 212-ULP and Charge No. 1414-M.C.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span> Publications, Inc. opposed the motion, alleging
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;"><span style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
</span>is no employer-employee relationship between the plaintiff and the
defendant;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no labor dispute between them;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's compound is separate and distinct
from the <span style="">compound </span>of the company
where the defendants are employed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants by way of
reply to the abovementioned opposition argued that even if there was no
employer- employee relationship, still the Court of First Instance would have
no jurisdiction to issue an injunction, citing several cases holding that there
could be a labor dispute regardless of whether or not the disputants stand </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">proximate relation of employer </span><span style="">and employee </span><span style="">and that
peaceful picketing is an extension of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the
Constitution,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a fundamental right granted to labor which
cannot be enjoined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since plaintiff averred in its complaint that "it <span style="">is </span>a second <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>
of a part of the premises of the Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. at 1000 <span class="SpellE">Cordeleria</span> Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila from Don Ramon <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>, first lessee from the aforementioned company, defendants
contend that plaintiff has no cause of action against then but against Don
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> under the provisions of Article 1654 of
the New Civil Code which obliges the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to
maintain the lessee in the peaceful and ade­quate enjoyment of the lease for
the entire duration of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 22, 1964, the lower court issued an order denying the
motion to dismiss and motion to dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction on
the ground that there was no labor dispute between the plaintiff and defendant
of which the Court of Industrial Relations may take cognizance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 16, 1964, the court, on motion of the plaintiff,
declared defendants in default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants prayed for the lifting of the order of default, which
plaintiff opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the order of
December 16, 1964, the court denied the motion to lift the order of default,
and subsequently defendants' motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the court rendered its decision
dated February 16, 1965 which declared permanent the writ of preliminary
injunction and ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiff jointly and
severally the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,152.42</span> with interest
thereon at legal rate from the commencement of the action until fully paid,
P1,000.00 as attorney's fees and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Copy of this deci­sion was received by defendants on July 20, 1965 and
forthwith, defendants filed the notice of appeal on July 26, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 12, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span> Publications, Inc. filed with the Supreme Court a
petition praying that a writ of attachment be issued on any sum of money which
is owing from the company to the union and to other defendants to be used to
satisfy the judgment in its favor should the same be affirmed by the Supreme
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants filed an opposition to the petition for attachment alleging
that even assuming that there is an amount owing to <span style="">the union </span>from the company, such would be in the <span style="">concept </span>of uncollected wages due the
strikers and, therefore, cannot be subject of attachment as provided by Art.
1708 of the New Civil Code that the labo­rers' wages shall not be subject to
execution or attachment except for debts incurred for food, shelter, clothing
and for medical attendance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Supreme Court denied
the above petition for attachment but without prejudice to the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> seeking remedy in the Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>The sole issue raised in the instant
appeal is whether or not the lower court has jurisdiction to issue <span style="">a writ of preliminary injunction considering
that there was a labor dispute between Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. and
appellants for alleged unfair labor practices committed by the former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first question that strikes <span class="GramE">Us</span> to be
of determinative significance is whether or not this case involves or has
arisen out of a labor dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it
does, then with certainty, section 9 of Republic Act 875, the "In­dustrial
Peace Act", would apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it does
not, then the Rules of Court will govern the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction because it will not <span class="GramE">partake</span> the
nature of a labor injunction which the lower court has no jurisdiction to
issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record before <span class="GramE">Us</span> reveals that
appellant union and its members picketed the gate leading to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> bodega.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This gate is about 200 meters from the gate leading to the premises of
the employer of the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> is not in any way related to <span style="">the </span>striking union except for the fact
that it is the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> of a bodega in the company's
compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The picketers belonging to the
appellant union had stopped and prohibited the truck of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
from entering the compound to load news­print from its bodega, the union
members intimidating and threatening with bodily harm the employees of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> who were in the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union members also stopped and prohibited
the general manager, personnel manager <span style="">including
the man in-charge of the bodega and other employees of the <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span>
Publications, Inc. from getting newsprint in said bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The business of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is exclusively the publication of the magazines <span class="SpellE">Bannawag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Hiligaynon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span> weekly magazines which has absolutely no relation
or connection whatsoever with the cause of the strike of the union against
their com­pany, much less with the terms, conditions or demands of the
strikers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a factual situation,
the query to be resolved is whether the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is a
third party or an "innocent by-stander" whose right </span><span style="">has </span><span style="">been invaded and, therefore, entitled to protection by the regular
courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At this juncture, it is
well to cite and stress the pronouncements of the Supreme Court on the right to
picket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of <u>Phil.
Association of Free Labor Unions (<span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span>) vs. Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, et al</u>.,
L-25878, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="3"><span style="">March 28, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, 27 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 465, 472,
the Supreme Court, speaking thru Justice <span class="SpellE">J.B.L</span>.
Reyes, said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The right to picket as a means of communicating the facts of
a labor dispute is a phrase of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the
constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If peacefully carried out,
it cannot be curtailed even in the absence of employer-employee relationship.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The right is, however, not an absolute one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While peaceful picketing is entitled to
protection as an exercise of free speech, we believe that courts are not
without power to confine or localize the sphere of com­munication or the
demonstration to the parties to the labor dispute, including those with related
interest, and to insulate es­tablishments or persons with no industrial
connection or having interest totally foreign to the context of the
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the right may be
regulated at the instance of third parties or 'innocent bystanders' if it
appears that the inevitable result of its exercise is to create an impression
that a labor dispute with which they have no connection or interest exists
between them and the picketing union or constitute an invasion of their rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case decided by this Court, we upheld
a trial court's injunction prohibiting the union from blocking the entrance to
a feed mill located within the compound of a flour mill with which the union
had a dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although sustained on a
different ground, no connection was found other than their being situated in
the same premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted
that in the instances cited, peaceful picketing has not been totally banned but
merely regulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in one American
case, a picket by a labor union in front of a motion picture theater with which
the union had a labor dispute was enjoined by the court from being extended in
front of the main entrance of the building housing the theater wherein other
stores operated by third persons were located."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The same <span class="GramE">case state</span> clearly and succinctly the rationalization for
the court's regulation of the right to picket in the following wise and manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<st1:city><st1:place>Wellington</st1:place></st1:city> and <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> are mere 'innocent bystanders'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are entitled to seek protection of their
rights from the courts and the courts may, accord­ingly, legally extend the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">PAFLU's</span></span><span style=""> right to peacefully picket <span class="SpellE">METBANK</span> is not
curtailed by the injunctions issued by respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The picket is merely regulated to protect the
rights of third parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the reason
for this is not farfetched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the law
fails to afford said protection, men will endeavor to safe­guard their rights
by their own might, take the law in their own hands, and com­mit acts which
lead to breaches of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should
not be allowed to happen."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may be conceded that
the appellant Union has a labor dispute with the Permanent Concrete Products
company and that the dispute is pending before the Court of Industrial
Relations docketed therein as CIR Case No. 156-Inj., Charge 212-ULP and Charge
No. 1414- <span class="SpellE">M.C</span>. Nonetheless, the rule <span class="GramE">laid</span> down in the case of <u>National Garment and Textile

holding that "where the Court of Industrial Relations has already acquired
jurisdiction over two unfair labor practices cases and much later on as a
consequence thereof, the Court of First Instance cannot legally issue a writ of
preliminary injunction against the picketers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations is
exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 5-a, Republic Act
875)" is not controlling, much less applicable to the instant case where
the facts are essentially and materially different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither is the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>SMB</u></span><u> Box Factory Workers' </u></span><st1:place><u><span style="">Union</span></u></st1:place><u><span style=""> vs. Hon. Gustavo <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>,

No. L-12820, Dec. 29, 1957, where We held that "the Court of First
Instance cannot take cognizance of an action for injunction where the issue
involved is interwoven with unfair labor practice cases pending in the Court of
Industrial Relations," nor the rule laid down in <u>Erlanger &amp; <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>, Inc. vs. Erlanger &amp; <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>

unfair labor practice suit has been filed at all by any of the parties in the
Court of Industrial Relations at the time the present petition for injunction
was filed in the court below, still the latter court would have no ju­risdiction
to issue the temporary restraining order prayed for if it is shown to its
satisfaction that the labor dispute arose out of unfair labor practices
committed by any of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
parties would still have to institute the proper action in the Court of
Industrial Relations, and there ask for a temporary restraining order under <span style="">sec. </span>9(d) of the Industrial Peace
Act."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot agree that the
above rules cited by the appellants are controlling in the instant case for </span>as
We said in <u>Phil. Association of Free Labor Unions (<span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span>),
et al. vs. Tan,</u> 99 Phil. 854, that "with regard to activities that may
be enjoined, in order to ascer­tain what court has jurisdiction to issue the

(underscoring supplied) We find and hold<span style="">
that </span>there is no connection between the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>

nor with the company against whom the strikers staged the strike, and neither
are the acts of the driver of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, its
general manager, personnel manager, the man in-charge of the bodega and other
employees of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in reaching the bodega to
obtain newsprint <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to feed and supply its

contention of appellants that the court erred </span>in denying their motion to

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 1654 of the New
Civil Code cited by the appellants in support of their motion to dismiss, which
obliges the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, among others, to maintain the

not against the appellant Union, is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The acts complained of against the
striking union members are properly called mere acts of trespass (<span class="SpellE">perturbacion</span> de <span class="SpellE">mero</span> <span class="SpellE">hecho</span>) such that following the doctrine laid down in <u>Goldstein

shall not be obliged to answer for the mere fact of a trespass (<span class="SpellE">perturbacion</span> de <span class="SpellE">mero</span> <span class="SpellE">hecho</span>) made by a third person in the use of the estate
leased but the lessee shall have a direct action against the trespasser.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The instant case falls
squarely under the provisions of Article 1664 of the New Civil Code which
provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1664. The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is not

right whatever."</blockquote>

acts, termed as legal trespass (<span class="SpellE">perturbacion</span> de <span class="SpellE">derecho</span>), disturb, dispute, object to, or place
difficulties in the way of the lessee's peaceful enjoyment of the premises that
in some manner or other cast doubt upon the right of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
by virtue of which the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> himself executed the
lease, in which case the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is obliged to answer
for said act of trespass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Briefly, if the act of trespass <span style="">is </span>not accompanied or preceded by anything which reveals a
really <span class="SpellE">juridic</span> intention on the part of the
trespasser, in such wise that the lessee can only distinguish the mate­rial
fact, stripped of all legal form or reasons, we understand it to be trespass <span style="">in fact only (de <span class="SpellE">mero</span>
<span class="SpellE">hecho</span>)." (pp. 566-567)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
