paying back the money, he had been prevented from doing so, "perhaps (by)
shame;" that he was still willing to settle his obligation, and <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> a "compromise ** to pay on staggered basis,

desired the next investigation to be at the same place, "<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> CTO," and that he should be represented therein

sign his statement (as he in fact afterwards did).<a style="mso-footnote-id:

his obligation, to the damage and prejudice of the offended party * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On arraignment on this charge, Felipe Ramos entered a plea of
"Not Guilty," and trial thereafter ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution of the case was undertaken by
lawyers of PAL under the direction and supervision of the Fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the close of the people's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">case, </span>the private prosecutors made a written offer of evidence
dated June 21, 1988,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> which
included "the (above mentioned) statement of accused Felipe J. Ramos taken
on February 9, 1986 at PAL <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City Ticket
Office," which had been marked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>Exhibit
A, as well as his "handwritten admission ** given on February 8,
1986," also above referred to, which had been marked as Exhibit K.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant's attorneys filed "Objections/Comments to
Plaintiff’s Evidence."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a>
Particularly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>regards the
people's Exhibit A, the objection was that "said document, which appears
to be a confession, was taken without the accused being represented by a
lawyer." Exhibit K was objected to "for the same reasons interposed
under Exhibits 'A' and 'J.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">By Order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="9" month="8">August 9,
 1988</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

all the exhibits "as part of the testimony of the witnesses who testified
in connection therewith and for whatever they are worth," except Exhibits
A and K, which it rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His Honor
declared Exhibit A "inadmissible in evidence, it appearing that it is the
statement of accused Felipe Ramos taken on February 9, 1986 at PAL <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City Ticket Office, in an investigation conducted by
the Branch Manager * * since it does not appear that the accused was reminded
of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to have counsel, and that
when he waived the same and gave his statement, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">was </span>with the assistance actually of a counsel." He also
declared inadmissible "Exhibit K, the handwritten admission made by
accused Felipe J. Ramos, given on February 8, 1986 ** for the same reason
stated in the exclusion of Exhibit 'A' since it does not appear that the
accused was assisted by counsel when he made said admission."</p>

<p class="BODY">The private prosecutors filed a motion for reconsideration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

12.0pt">5</span></span></a> In justification of said Order, respondent Judge
invoked this Court's rulings in Morales, Jr. v. Juan Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>,
et al., 121 SCRA 538, <span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. v. <span class="SpellE">Galit</span>,

142 SCRA 219, and <span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. v. <span class="SpellE">Decierdo</span>,
149 SCRA 496, among others, to the effect that "in custodial investigations
the right to counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid unless
made with the assistance of counsel," and the explicit precept in the
present Constitution that the rights in custodial investigation "cannot be
waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel." He pointed out
that the investigation of Felipe Ramos at the PAL <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
Station was one "for the offense of allegedly misappropriating the
proceeds of the tickets issued to him" and therefore clearly fell
"within the coverage of the constitutional provision;" and the fact
that Ramos was not detained at the time, or the investigation was
administrative in character could not operate to except the case "from the
ambit of the constitutional provision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">cited."</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

prosecutors in the name of the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By Resolution dated October 26, 1988, the
Court required Judge <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span> and Felipe Ramos to
comment on the petition, and directed issuance of a "TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
ORDER ** ENJOINING the respondents from proceeding further with the trial
and/or hearing of Criminal Case No. 3488-R (People ** vs. Felipe Ramos), including
the issuance of any order, decision or judgment in the aforesaid case or on any
matter in relation to the same case, now pending before the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, Br. 6, First Judicial
Region." The Court also subsequently required the Solicitor General to
comment on the petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The comments of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span>, Felipe Ramos, and the Solicitor General
have all been filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor
General has made common cause with the petitioner and prays "that the
petition be given due course and thereafter judgment be rendered setting aside
respondent Judge's Orders ** and ordering him to admit Exhibits 'A' and 'K' of
the prosecution."<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor
General has thereby removed whatever impropriety might have attended the
institution of the instant action in the name of the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by lawyers <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">de</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><i>parte</i></span> of

<p class="BODY">The Court deems that there has been full ventilation of the issue
-- of whether or not it was grave abuse of discretion for respondent Judge to
have excluded the People's Exhibits A and K.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It will now proceed to resolve it.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the core of the controversy is Section 20, Article IV of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1973</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>Constitution,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> to which
respondent Judge has given a construction that is disputed by the People.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The section reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No person shall be
compelled to be a witness against himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall
have the right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such
right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No force, violence, threat,
intimidation, or any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used
against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any confession obtained in
violation of this section shall be inadmissible in evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should at once be apparent that there are two (2) rights, or
sets of rights, dealt with in the section, namely:</p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the right against </span>self-incrimination</i>
-- i.e., the right of a person not to be compelled to be a witness against
himself -- set out in the first sentence, which is a verbatim reproduction of
Section 18, Article III of the 1935 Constitution, and is similar to that
accorded by the Fifth Amendment of the American Constitution;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the rights of a person in custodial </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">interrogation,</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> i.e., </span>the rights of every suspect
"under investigation for the commission of an offense."</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, the 1987 Constitution indicates much more
clearly the individuality and disparateness of these rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has placed the rights in separate
sections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right against
self-incrimination, "No person shall be compelled to be a witness against
himself," is now embodied in Section 17,</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Article III of the 1987
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rights of a person in
custodial interrogation, which have been made more explicit, are now contained
in Section 12 of the same Article III.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The first right, against self-incrimination, mentioned in Section
20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, is accorded to every person who gives
evidence, whether voluntarily or under compulsion of <i>subpoena,</i> in any
civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a> The right

party or not, the right to refuse to answer any <i>particular</i> incriminatory
question, i.e., one the answer to which has a tendency to incriminate him for
some crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the right can be
claimed only when the specific question, incriminatory in character, is
actually put to the witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
be claimed at any other time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does
not give a witness the right to disregard a <i>subpoena</i>, to decline to appear
before the court at the time appointed, or to refuse to testify
altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The witness receiving a <i>subpoena</i>
must obey it, appear as required, take the stand, be sworn and answer
questions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only when a <i>particular</i>
question is addressed to him, the answer to which may incriminate him for some
offense, that he may refuse to answer on the strength of the constitutional
guaranty.</p>

<p class="BODY">That first sentence of Section 20, Article IV of the 1973
Constitution does not impose on the judge, or other officer presiding over a
trial, hearing or investigation, any affirmative obligation to advise a witness
of his right against self-incrimination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a right that a witness knows or should know, in accordance with
the well known axiom that everyone is presumed to know the law, that ignorance
of the law excuses no one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
in the very nature of things, neither the judge nor the witness can be expected
to know in advance the character or effect of a question to be put to the
latter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

automatically operational.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be
claimed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If not claimed by or in behalf
of the witness, the protection does not come into play.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the right may be waived,
expressly, or impliedly, as by a failure to claim it at the appropriate time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution also treats of a
second right, or better said, group of rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These rights apply to persons "under investigation for the

<p class="BODY">It is pertinent at this point to inquire whether the rights just
discussed, i.e., (1) that against self-incrimination and (2) those during
custodial interrogation apply to persons <i>under preliminary investigation </i>or
already<i> charged in court </i>for a crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems quite evident that a defendant on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">trial or under </span>preliminary
investigation is not under custodial interrogation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His interrogation by the police, if any there
had been, would already have been ended at the time of the filing of the
criminal case in court (or the public prosecutors' office).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, with respect to a defendant in a
criminal case already pending in court (or the public prosecutor's office),
there is no occasion to speak of his rights while under "custodial
interrogation" laid down by the second and subsequent sentences of Section
20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, for the obvious reason that he is no
longer under "custodial interrogation."</p>

<p class="BODY">But unquestionably, the accused in court (or undergoing preliminary
investigation before the public prosecutor), in common with all other persons,
possesses the right against self-incrimination set out in the first sentence of
Section 20 Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, i.e., the right to refuse to
answer a specific incriminatory question at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the time that it is put to him.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">2</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the accused in a criminal case in court has other
rights in the matter of giving testimony or refusing to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An accused "occupies a different tier of
protection from an ordinary witness." Under the Rules of Court, in all
criminal prosecutions the defendant is entitled, among others-</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to be exempt from being
a witness against himself,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> and </p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to testify as witness
in his own behalf; but if he offers himself as a witness he may be
cross-examined <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as any </span>other
witness; however, his neglect or refusal to be a witness shall not in any
manner prejudice or be used against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The right of the defendant in a criminal case "to be exempt from
being a witness against himself” signifies that he cannot be compelled to
testify or produce evidence in the criminal case in which he is the accused, or
one of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot be
compelled to do so even by <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">subpoena</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>or other process or order of the
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot be required to be a

9.0pt"> </span>having only the right to refuse to answer a particular
incriminatory question at the time it is put to him -- the defendant in a
criminal action can refuse to testify altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He can refuse to take the witness stand, be
sworn, answer any question.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">4</span></span></a> And, as

<p class="BODY">If he should wish to testify in his own behalf, however, he may
do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is his right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But if he does testify, then he "may be
cross-examined as any other witness." He may be cross-examined as to any
matters stated in his direct examination, or connected therewith.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

any question on the ground that the answer that he will give, or the evidence
he will produce, would have a tendency to incriminate him for the crime with
which he is charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It must however be made
clear that if the defendant in a criminal action be asked a question which
might incriminate him, not for the crime with which he is charged, but for <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">some other crime,</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>distinct from that of which he is
accused, he may decline to answer that specific question, on the strength of
the right against self-incrimination granted by the first sentence of Section
20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution (now Section 17 of the 1987
Constitution).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, assuming that in a
prosecution for <i>murder</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">, </span>the
accused should testify in his behalf, he may not on cross-examination refuse to
answer any question on the ground that he might be implicated in that crime of
murder; but he may decline to answer any particular question which might
implicate him for a different and distinct offense, say, <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">estafa</span></i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should by now be abundantly apparent that respondent Judge has

applying to the same juridical situation, equating one with the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In so doing, he has grossly erred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, His Honor sought to substantiate
his thesis by arguments he took to be cogent and logical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The thesis was however so far divorced from
the actual and correct state of the constitutional and legal principles
involved as to make application of said thesis to the case before him
tantamount to totally unfounded, whimsical or capricious exercise of
power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His Orders were thus rendered
with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">grave </span>abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They should be as they are
hereby, annulled and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the undisputed facts of this case that Felipe
Ramos was not in any sense under <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">custodial
</span>interrogation,</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>the
term should be properly understood, prior to and during the administrative
inquiry into the discovered irregularities in ticket sales in which he appeared
to have had a hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional
rights of a person under custodial interrogation under Section 20, Article IV
of the 1973 Constitution did not therefore come into play, were of no relevance
to the inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also clear, too,
that Ramos had voluntarily answered questions posed to him on the first day of
the administrative investigation, February 9, 1986 and agreed that the
proceedings should be recorded, the record having thereafter been marked during
the trial of the criminal action subsequently filed against him as Exhibit A,
just as it is obvious that the note (later marked as Exhibit K) that he sent to
his superiors on February 8, 1986, the day before the investigation, offering
to compromise his liability in the alleged irregularities, was a free and even
spontaneous act on his part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They may
not be excluded on the ground that the so-called “<i>Miranda </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rights"</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>had not been accorded to Ramos.</p>

<p class="BODY">His Honor adverts to what he perceives to be the "greater
danger ** (of) the violation of the right of any person against
self-incrimination when the investigation is conducted by the complaining
parties, complaining companies, or complaining employers because being
interested parties, unlike the police agencies who have no proprietary or pecuniary
interest to protect, they may in their <span class="SpellE">overeagerness</span>
or zealousness bear heavily on their hapless suspects, whether employees or
not, to give statements under an atmosphere of moral coercion, undue
ascendancy, and undue influence." It suffices to draw attention to the
specific and peremptory requirement of the law that disciplinary sanctions may
not be imposed on any employee by his employer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">until </span>and unless the employee has been accorded due process, by
which is meant that the latter must be informed of the offenses ascribed to him
and afforded adequate time and opportunity to explain his side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The requirement entails the making of
statements, oral or written, by the employee under such administrative
investigation in his defense, with opportunity to solicit the assistance of
counsel, or his colleagues and friends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The employee may, of course, refuse to submit any statement at the
investigation, that is his privilege.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But if he should opt to do so, in his defense to the accusation against
him, it would be absurd to reject his statements, whether at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">administrative </span>investigation, or at a
subsequent criminal action brought against him, because he had not been
accorded, prior to his making and presenting them, his <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"<i>Miranda </i></span><i>rights"</i></b>
(to silence and to counsel and to be informed thereof, etc.) which, to repeat,

13.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed, it is
self-evident that the employee's statements, whether called "position
paper," "answer," etc., are submitted by him precisely so that they
may be admitted and duly considered by the investigating officer or committee,
in negation or mitigation of his liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course the possibility cannot be discounted that in certain
instances the judge's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">expressed </span>apprehensions
may be realized, that violence or intimidation, undue pressure or influence be
brought to bear on an employee under investigation -- or for that matter, on a
person being interrogated by another whom he has supposedly offended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such an event, any admission or confession
wrung from the person under interrogation would be inadmissible in evidence, on
proof of the vice or defect vitiating consent, not because of a violation of
Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, but simply on the general,
incontestable proposition that involuntary or coerced <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
