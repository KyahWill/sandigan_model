This is a petition for certiorari to review the decision of respondent 
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated March 31, 1982, 
dismissing the petitioner's appeal and affirming in toto the Labor 
Arbiter's decision to wit:
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"> <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
    <p> "x x x Suffice it for us to state that the only provision in the
 CBA granting maternity benefits is Article X of the said CBA.  And it 
only grants maternity leave benefits of 45 days.  Really, if the 
intention of the parties is for the company to undertake the expenses 
incurred by way of ceasarian or even natural child birth, they could 
have easily provided it so in Article X of the CBA.  Complainants are 
aware or should have been aware of this claimed benefit from the CBA 
since they are participants to the contract.  Yet, they did not do 
anything about it during the negotiation and conclusion of the CBA.  For
 us therefore to interpret the provision of Article X beyond its simple 
and precise meaning would certainly be sheer abuse of discretion on our 
part."
    </p>

  <p>
Singapore Airlines Limited is a foreign corporation duly licensed to 
engage in the business of common carrier in the Philippines.
</p><p>
Petitioner, Cecilia E. Matriano, on the other hand, is employed by 
Singapore Airlines Limited (hereinafter referred to as SIA) as a 
telephone operator/receptionist.
</p><p>
On July 25, 1981, a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) was concluded 
between the complainant Singapore Airlines Local 
Employees-NTUAI-TRANSPIL-TUPAS (of which petitioner Matriano is a 
member) and respondent Singapore Airlines Limited.  The CBA provides 
among other things:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "ARTICLE XI - <em>Hospitalization, Medical Care Benefits </em></p>
  <p> "Section 1.  The COMPANY will meet expenses up to P9,000.00 per 
calendar year for ward charges and surgical fees in respect of each 
employee except as provided in Section 3.  x x x. </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "Section 3.  The company shall not bear any expenses arising from any of the following: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "(a)    illness or disablement arising from attempted suicide 
the performance of any unlawful act, exposure to any unjustifiable 
hazards except when endeavoring to save human life, provoked assault, 
the use of drugs other than those prescribed by the COMPANY's doctors or
 other duly qualified and registered medical practitioner or any breach 
of the peace or disorderly conduct; </p>
    <p> "(b)    where hospitalization is necessary as a result of misconduct or negligence on the part of the employee."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
In June 1981, petitioner Matriano underwent a caesarian operation for 
which expenses were incurred amounting to P6,393.70 representing 
hospital, medical, and surgical fees.  Thereafter, Matriano filed a 
claim with SIA for reimburse­ment of said expenses pursuant to Article 
XI of the CBA aforequoted.  Respondent SIA refused, contending that 
Matriano is not entitled to hospitalization and medical benefits under 
Article XI as its liability in maternity cases is limited to the 
maternity leave benefit provided in Article X of the CBA, which 
provides"
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "ARTICLE X - <em>Maternity Leave Benefits </em></p>
  <p> "The COMPANY will grant maternity leave benefits of forty-five (45) days pursuant to PD 1202."
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is further contended that Article XI which, except for the amount of 
benefit, has been lifted from Paragraph 13 of the "Conditions for 
Employment for Locally Engaged Staff in the Philippines" which was 
adopted in toto, should receive the same interpretation as the latter, 
traditionally understood to exclude maternity cases, the benefits for 
the same being specifically provided for under Article X of the CBA in 
question.
</p><p>
On the other hand, petitioners are of the considered view that the 
liability of SIA regarding maternity leaves, under Article X, is 
separate and distinct from the hospi­talization benefits provided under 
Article XI.  As expressly agreed upon in Article XVIII of the CBA, "Each
 article in this agreement is separate and independent from the others 
and not to be construed as having to have restrictive effect upon the 
meaning of the other." (page 30 of the CBA).  They also contend that 
maternity cases, more specifically caesarian operations are not among 
those mentioned as exceptions to Article X or these would have been so 
provided, if such was the intent.
</p><p>
Hence, upon SIA's refusal to grant the complainant's claim, the 
Singapore Airlines Employees' Association, in behalf of individual 
complainant Matriano, charged SIA before Labor Arbiter Sofronio Ona with
 unfair labor practice for violation of the CBA.
</p><p>
The Labor Arbiter dismissed the case, stating that pregnancy cannot be 
considered as sickness per se to entitle an employee to the 
hospitalization benefits under Article XI of the CBA.
</p><p>
On appeal, the NLRC sustained the Labor Arbiter's decision, finding no 
basis for the charge of unfair labor practice.  Hence, this petition.
</p><p>
Two main issues are to be resolved, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (a)  Whether or not under the CBA petitioner Matriano is entitled to
 reimbursement of her hospitalization expenses as a result of her 
caesarian operation; and
  </p>
  <p>
    (b)  Whether or not respondents are guilty of unfair labor practice.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We find no difficulty in disposing of the matter at hand.  The 
provisions of the CBA in question are clear and from them we gather the 
intent of the contracting parties.
</p><p>
The very title of Article XI alone provides us with an answer to the 
first issue raised.  Borrowing a principle of statutory construction, it
 is well-established that titles given to sections of an act or contract
 are often resorted to for the purpose of determining the scope of the 
provisions and their relation to other portions of the act (Francisco, 
Statutory Construction, Second Edition, pp. 186-187).  In very general 
terms, Section I, Article XI provides hospitalization and medical care 
benefits.  From the language of the Article in question, no 
qualification as to cause of confinement or need of medical care is 
made.  The contention that pregnancy or childbirth is not sick­ness per 
se so as to be reimbursable under the CBA is untenable.  Article XI 
neither states nor implies that its provisions apply only to sickness.  
In fact, it speaks of "illness or disablement", for one may be 
hospitalized not only for treatment of disease but also for injury, 
disability or incapacity.
</p><p>
The disputed CBA provision states that the "Company will meet expenses 
up to P9,000 per calendar year forward expenses and surgical fees in 
respect of each employee x x x." Undoubtedly, the hospitalization 
expenses of petitioner for her caesarian operation are covered by the 
very wordings of the provision, as it involves surgery.  To adopt 
respondent's strained interpretation would be to create an absurd 
situation whereby an employee may no longer avail of the benefits under 
Article XI when one is on vacation, sick, or compassionate leave, which 
are also separately granted in the same way that maternity leave 
benefits are provided as distinct privileges.  Such a construction 
would, of course, be absurd, and yet the respondents would apply it to 
another form of leave.  Reasonable and practical interpretation must be 
placed on contractual provisions.  <em>Interpretatio fienda est ut res magis valeat quam pereat</em>.
  Such interpretation is to be adopted, that the thing may continue to 
have efficacy rather than fail.  (Martin v. Sheppard, 102 S Co. 2nd p. 
1036; Adamonski v. Bord, AC, Pa. 193F 2d p. 578; Shimonek v. Tillanan 1 
P. 2d 154; Almeda v. Florentino, G.R. No. L-23800, Dec, 21, 1965).
</p><p>
Sick leave, maternity leave, and vacation leave benefits are intended to
 be replacements for regular income which otherwise would not be earned 
because an employee is not working during the period of said leaves.  If
 an employee is on leave for 100 days, he gets his salary for 100 days 
without having to work during those days.  There is absolutely no 
connection between the expenditures for sickness, childbirth, or 
vacation trips and the amount of sick leave, maternity leave, or 
vacation leave benefits.  Thus, if a company grants sick leave or full 
pay during the period when an employee is sick and <em>at the same time grants </em>hospital
 or medical expenses incurred as a result of the sickness, there is no 
incongruity or conflict between the two types of privileges -- one is 
sick leave while the other is medical benefits.  In the same manner, 
there is no conflict between maternity leave benefits which are nothing 
else but full salaries for 45 days in this case and the hospitalization 
and surgical benefits for expenses incurred during the same period for 
hospitalization and surgery.
</p><p>
By analogy, qualified workers in the private sector are given sickness 
benefits under the Social Security Act, as amended, as well as medicare 
benefits under the Medicare provisions of the Labor Code.  Sickness 
benefits are intended to replace, even if only partially, <em>lost income</em> during the period of sickness while medicare benefits partially defray <em>the costs of hospitalization and surgical care</em>.  One benefit does not exclude the other.
</p><p>
The above conclusion is bolstered by the fact that under the CBA in this
 case, exceptions are specifically provided.  The disputed contingency 
of surgery and hospitalization does not come under the exceptions 
provided by Section 3 of Article XI which enumerates specific instances 
to wit:  "illness and disablement" arising from illegal, immoral, 
wrongful, negligent, aggressive, or similar acts.  None of these specify
 nor even remotely imply pregnancy or childbirth.  Had it been their 
purpose to exclude, then SIA should have expressly excluded the two as 
it did in the CBA with its employees in Singapore.  Not being so 
excepted, hospital and medical care benefits due to pregnancy or 
childbirth are reimbursable under the general rule set by Article XI.  <em>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em>
 (In re Estate of Enriquez, 29 Phil. 167; Gomez v. Ventura, 54 Phil. 
726; Managat et al. v. Aquino, et al, 92 Phil. 1025).  Anything that is 
not included in an enumeration is excluded therefrom, and a meaning that
 does not appear nor is intended or reflected in the very language of 
the statute cannot be placed therein.
</p><p>
Moreover, we cannot restrict the application of Article XI by 
correlating it with another separate and independent Article on 
Maternity Leave.  The parties have provided for a separability clause 
under Article XVIII of the CBA.  They agreed that one article of the CBA
 cannot have a restrictive effect upon the meaning of another article.
</p><p>
Respondents also advance the argument that since the CBA in question was
 lifted, almost verbatim, from the "Conditions of Employment for Locally
 Engaged Staff in the Philippines", it should likewise be interpreted as
 exclud­ing maternity hospitalization and medical care benefits.  We do 
not agree.  Petitioner's reasons are well taken and we quote:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We beg to disagree.  Firstly, Article XI provided for 
non-hospitalization medical care and dental benefits (Sections 4 and 5) 
which were not in the 'Conditions of Employment'.  Secondly, since the 
said policy was unilaterally promulgated by SIA, its implementation was 
solely within the prerogative of SIA and the employees could not do 
anything even if SIA did not fully implement it by refusing to extend 
hospitalization and medical care benefits to its employees who were 
hospitalized because of childbirth. <em> However, once the policy was 
incorporated in a collective bargaining agreement, the employees thru 
their Union have as much right as the Company in its  proper 
implementation.</em>"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As a bilateral act and a result of long deliberation and dialogue 
between he parties, the CBA is law between the parties (Kapisanan ng mga
 Manggagawa sa La Suerte-FOITAF v. Noriel, 77 SCRA 414; Batangas-Laguna 
Tayabas Bus Company v. Court of Appeals, 71 SCRA 470; Philippine Apparel
 Workers’ Union v. NLRC, 106 SCRA 444).  Having the force of law between
 the parties, obligations arising therefrom should be complied with in 
good faith (De Cortes v. Venturanza, 79 SCRA 709).
</p><p>
Parenthetically, the Solicitor General, as counsel for the public 
respondent agrees that this petition is impressed with merit and states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Whether child birth is an illness or not is immaterial.  Article 
XI of the CBA does not make a distinction.  The only exceptions where 
hospitalization benefits may not be availed of are those enumerated in 
Section 3 of the same Article XI, relating to attempted suicide, use of 
drugs and those arising from employees misconduct.  Child birth not 
being one of the excepted causes, it is therefore, included in its 
coverage."
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "Finally, to exclude hospitalization expenses for child delivery 
from the coverage of the said CBA provision would be a strained 
application that favors the employer, negates the labor protection 
clause in the Constitution and runs counter to the pronouncement of this
 Honorable Court that the construction of labor legislation and labor 
contracts should be in favor of safety and decent living of the laborer 
(PALEA v. PAL, 70 SCRA 214; Insular Lumber Co. v. C.A., 80 SCRA 28; 
Phil. Apparel Workers' Union v. NLRC, 106 SCRA 444)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Despite a finding of petitioner's entitlement to her claim for 
reimbursement, we are not prepared to pronounce respondent SIA guilty of
 unfair labor practice.  SIA's refusal to grant benefits was not a 
willful evasion of its obligations under the CBA but was due to an 
honest mistake in the belief that the same is not covered by the 
aforementioned CBA provision.  An error in interpretation without malice
 or bad faith does not constitute unfair labor practice.  We take 
judicial notice of the fact that honest differences in construction may 
arise in the actual application of contractual provisions.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the decision of the respondent Commission is hereby MODIFIED.
  The petition is granted insofar as petitioners' claim for 
reimbursement is concerned.  Private respondent Singapore Airlines 
Limited is ordered to refund petitioner Cecilia Matriano the amount of 
SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE PESOS and SEVENTY CENTAVOS 
(P6,393.70) representing hospital, medical and surgical expenses which 
the latter had incurred during her pregnancy and childbirth.  The 
respondent Commission's finding that no unfair labor practice was 
committed is AFFIRMED.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Plana, Relova, </em>and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, J.,</em> on official leave.
