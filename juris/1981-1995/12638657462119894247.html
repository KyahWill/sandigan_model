the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 58118-R affirming the
decision in Civil Case No. 74593 of the then Court of First Instance (now
Regional Trial Court), Branch XI, Manila which dismissed the petitioners' claim
for damages against <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>

for damages due to the death of several passengers as a result of the sinking
of the vessel of defendant, the M/V '<span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>', on
November 4, 1967.</blockquote>

Washington, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, with many passengers aboard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that said vessel met typhoon '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>' on the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sibuyan</span>

husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to her, when she
boarded the second deck of the vessel, she saw about 200 persons therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">to </span>see whether she could be accommodated in the third deck or
first deck because the second deck was very crowded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She admitted that she was not included in the
manifest because she boarded the boat without a ticket, but she purchased one
in the vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified further
that the boat was not able to reach its destination due to its sinking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the typhoon before the vessel sunk,
she was able to board a 'balsa.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ruben Reyes, the other survivor, declared that he paid for
his ticket before boarding the M/V <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time he had with him personal
belongings and cash all in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,900.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that Felix Reyes <span class="SpellE">Jakusalem</span>, Teresa <span class="SpellE">Pamatian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">delos</span></span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> drowned during the sinking
of the vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was able to swim on
(sic) an island and was with the others, rescued later on and brought to the
hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The survivors were then taken
ashore (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">M, p. 188, rec.).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Salim</span>
declared that Teresa <span class="SpellE">Pamatian</span>, his aunt and Diego <span class="SpellE">Salim</span>, his father, drowned along with the sinking of the
M/V <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This witness declared that he accompanied both his father and his aunt
to the pier to board the boat and at the time Teresa <span class="SpellE">Pamatian</span>
was bringing cash and personal belongings of about P250.00 worth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His father brought with him P200.00 in cash plus
some belongings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that when
his father boarded the vessel he did not have yet a ticket.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiffs further submitted in evidence a copy of a
Radiogram stating among other things that the M/V <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
was loaded also with 3,000 cases of beer, one dump truck and 292 various goods
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">D and D-1, p. 162 <span class="SpellE">rec</span>).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that in a decision of the Board of Marine Inquiry,
dated February 2, 1970, it was found that the captain and some officers of the
crew were negligent in operating the vessel and imposed upon them a suspension
and/or revocation of their license certificates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that this decision cannot
be executed against the captain who perished with the vessel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. </span><span class="GramE">E, E-1, E-1-A, E-2 to E-9, pp. 163-168 rec.).</span></blockquote>

and, in fact, the <span class="SpellE">shipowners</span> and their officers took
all the necessary precautions in operating the vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the loss of lives as a result of
the drowning of some passengers, including the relatives of the herein
plaintiffs, was due to <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>
because of the strong typhoon '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>.' It appears
also that there was a note of marine protest in connection with the sinking of
the vessel as substantiated by affidavits (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 3,

Saul, member of the PC Judge Advocate General's Office, brought to Court
records of this case which were referred to their office by the Board of Marine
Inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him the decision
referred to by the plaintiffs was appealed to the Department of National
Defense, although he did not know the result of the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, he knew that the Department of
National Defense remanded the case to the Board of Marine Inquiry for further
investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the second <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> signed by <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Plana</span>, Undersecretary of National Defense, it is stated,
among other things, that the hearings of the Board of Marine Inquiry wherein
the Philippine Coast Guard made the decision lacked the necessary quorum as
required by Section 827 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the decision of the Commandant of
the Philippine Coast Guard relied principally on the findings reached by the
Board of Officers after an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> investigation
especially in those aspects unfavorable to the captain (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<p class="BODY">The petition has merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the outset, <span class="GramE">We</span> note that there is no dispute as to the
finding of the captain's negligence in the mishap.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The present controversy centers on the
questions of <span class="SpellE">Maritima's</span> negligence and of the
application of Article 587 of the Code of Commerce.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said article provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 587<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> ship agent shall also be civilly liable for indemnities in
favor of third persons which may arise from the conduct of the captain in the
care of the goods which he loaded on the vessel, but he may exempt himself <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by abandoning the vessel with all her equipments
and the freight it may have earned during the voyage."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Under this provision, a <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> or agent has the right of abandonment; and by
necessary implication, his liability is confined to that which he is entitled
as of right to abandon-"the vessel with all her equipments and the freight
it may have earned during the voyage" (<span class="SpellE">Yangco</span> v.
<span class="SpellE">Laserna</span>, et al. 73 Phil. 330, 332).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the passage of the New Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Code, </span>Article 587 of the Code of
Commerce is still good law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason
lies in the peculiar nature of maritime law which is "exclusively real and
<span class="SpellE">hypothecary</span> that operates to limit such liability to
the value of the vessel, or to the insurance thereon, if any (<span class="SpellE">Yangco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Laserna</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ibid</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

necessary to offset against the innumerable hazards and perils of a sea voyage
and to encourage shipbuilding and marine commerce (Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the petitioners’ supposition, the limited liability doctrine
applies not only to the goods but also in all cases like death or injury to
passengers wherein the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> or agent may
properly be held liable for the negligent or illicit acts of the captain (<span class="SpellE">Yangco</span> v<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">. </span><span class="SpellE">Laserna</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ibid</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It
must be stressed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">at </span>this point
that Article 587 speaks only of situations where the fault or negligence is
committed solely by the captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
cases where the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> is likewise to be blamed,
Article 587 does not apply (see <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> Steamship Co.,
Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Abdulhanan</span>, et al., 100 Phil. 32, 38).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a situation will be covered by the
provisions of the New Civil Code on Common Carriers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Owing to the nature of their business and for
reasons of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public policy, </span>common
carriers are tasked to observe extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over
the goods and for the safety of its passengers (Article 1733, New Civil
Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, they are bound to carry

utmost diligence of very cautious persons, with a due regard for all the
circumstances (Article 1755, New Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whenever death or injury to a passenger occurs, common carriers are

<p class="BODY">Guided by the above legal provisions, <span class="GramE">We</span>
painstakingly reviewed the records of the case and found imprints of <span class="SpellE">Maritima's</span> negligence which compel Us to reverse the
conclusion of the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> claims that it did not have
any information about typhoon '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>' until after
the boat was already at sea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Modern <span class="GramE">technology belie</span> such contention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Weather Bureau is now equipped with
modern apparatus which enables it to detect any incoming atmospheric
disturbances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his summary report on
tropical cyclone '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>' which occurred within the
Philippine Area of Responsibility, Dr. Roman L. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>,
Weather Bureau Director, stated that during the periods of November 1-5, 1967,
the Bureau issued a total of seventeen (17) warnings or advisories of typhoon '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>' to shipping companies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, he reported that:</p>

typhoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was by then located at 8.7 N
137.3 E with sea level pressure of 978 <span class="SpellE">millibars</span>, an
eye diameter of about 18.53 kilometers and a maximum surface wind of 139

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Considering the above report and the
evidence on record showing the late departure of the ship at 6:00 p.m. (instead
of the scheduled 2:00 p.m. departure) on November 2, 1967, We find it highly
improbable that the Weather Bureau had not yet issued any typhoon bulletin at
any time during the day to the shipping companies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> submitted
no convincing evidence to show this omission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">It's</span> evidence showing the Weather Bureau's
forecast of <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1967</st1:date>
is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">persuasive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It merely indicated the weather bulletin of
that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere could We find any

forecast on November 1 and 2, 1967 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6, Records,
p. 257).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the appellate
court found that the ship's captain through his action showed prior knowledge
of the typhoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court said:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">If the captain knew of the typhoon
beforehand, it is inconceivable for <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> to be
totally in the dark of '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>.' In allowing the
ship to depart late from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
despite the typhoon advisories, <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> displayed
lack of foresight and minimum concern for the safety of its passengers taking
into account the surrounding circumstances <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of </span>the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">While <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with the appellate court
that the captain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was negligent for
overloading </span>the ship, We, however, rule that <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">shares equally in his negligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find </span>that while M/V <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> was already cleared by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Bureau of </span>Customs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and
the Coast Guard for departure at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">2:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, the ship's departure </span>was, however,
delayed for four hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> could not account for the delay because it neither
checked from the captain the reasons behind the delay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">nor sent </span>its representative to inquire into the cause of such
delay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was due to this interim that
the appellate court noted that "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)<span class="SpellE">ndeed</span> there is a great probability <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">that </span><span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cargo (such as dump truck, 3 </span><span class="SpellE">toyota</span> cars, steel bars, and 6,000 beer cases) and
passengers (about 241 more than the authorized 193 passengers) were loaded
during the four (4) hour interval" (Decision, p. 13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 26).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perchance, a closer supervision
could have prevented the overloading of the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> could have
directed the ship's captain to immediately depart in view of the fact that as
of <st1:time minute="7" hour="11">11:07</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1967</st1:date>, the typhoon had
already attained surface winds of about 240 kilometers per hour.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the appellate court stated, "(v<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">erily</span></span>, if it were not for this
delay, the vessel could have reached (its) destination and thereby have avoided
the effects of the storm" (Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
26).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion was buttressed by
evidence that another ship, M/V <span class="SpellE">Mangaren</span>, an <span class="SpellE">interisland</span> vessel, sailed for New Washington, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="11">November
 2, 1967</st1:date>, ahead of M/V Mindoro and took the same route as the latter
but it arrived safely (Exh. <span class="GramE">BB-2, Index of Exhibits, pp.
143-144 and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">4-A, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ibid</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">, </span>p. 254).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> presents evidence of the
seaworthy condition of the ship prior to its departure to prove that it
exercised extraordinary diligence in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>M/V <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> was <span class="SpellE">drydocked</span>
for about a month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Necessary repairs
were made on the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Life saving
equipment and navigational instruments were installed.</p>

<p class="BODY">While indeed it is true that all these things were done on the
vessel, <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>, however, could not present evidence
that it specifically installed <span class="GramE">a radar</span> which could
have allowed the vessel to navigate safely for shelter during a storm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the vessel was left at the
mercy of '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>' in the open sea because although
it was already in the vicinity of the <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> river, it
was unable to enter the mouth of <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> River to get
into New Washington, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> due to darkness and the <span class="SpellE">Floripon</span> Lighthouse at the entrance of the <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> River was not functioning or could not be seen at all
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3-H, Index of Exhibits, pp. 192-195; see also <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2-A, <u>ibid</u>, p. 160).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Storms and typhoons <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">are </span>not strange occurrences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 1967 alone before '<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>,' there were
about 17 typhoons that hit the country (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. M, Index
of Exhibits, p. 115), the latest of which was typhoon <span class="SpellE">Uring</span>
which occurred on October 20-25, which cost so much damage to lives and
properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the impending threat of
'<span class="SpellE">Welming</span>,' an important device such as the radar
could have enabled the ship to pass through the river and to safety.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing clearly demonstrates that <span class="SpellE">Maritima's</span>
lack of extraordinary diligence coupled with the negligence of the captain as
found by the appellate court were the proximate causes of the sinking of M/V <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> is liable for the deaths and injury of the
victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the above finding, <span class="GramE">We</span> now come to
the amount of damages due to the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ordinarily, <span class="GramE">We</span> would remand the case to the
trial court for the reception of evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering however, that this case has been pending for almost
twenty-three (23) years now and that since all the evidence had already been presented
by both parties and received by the trial court, We resolve to decide the
corresponding damages due to petitioners (see <span class="SpellE">Samal</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 99 Phil. 230; Del Castillo v. <span class="SpellE">Jaymalin</span>,
L-28256, March 17, 1982, 112 SCRA 629).</p>

<p class="BODY">In their complaint filed with the Court of First Instance, petitioners
prayed for moral, actual and exemplary damages, as well as for attorney's fees
plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 1764 in relation to Article 2206 of the New Civil
Code, the amount of damages for the death of a passenger caused by the breach
of contract by a common carrier is at least three thousand pesos (P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
prevailing jurisprudence has increased the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
to P30,000.00 (De Lima v. Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Co.,
L-35697-99, April 15, 1988, 160 SCRA 70).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> should pay the civil
indemnity of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to the heirs of each of the
victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For mental anguish suffered due
to the deaths of their relatives, <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> should
also pay to the heirs the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each as
moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, it was proven at the trial that at the time of
death, (1) <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE">delos</span>
Santos had with her cash in the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and
personal belongings valued at P500.00; (2) Teresa <span class="SpellE">Pamatian</span>,
cash in the sum of P250.00 and personal belongings worth P200.00; and (3) Diego
Salem, cash in the sum of P200.00 and personal belongings valued at
P100.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it was established
that the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">delos</span></span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and her deceased children incurred transportation and incidental expenses in
connection with the trial of this case in the amount of P500.00 while <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Salem, son of victim Diego Salem and nephew of
victim Teresa <span class="SpellE">Pamatian</span> spent about P100.00 for
expenses at the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to
petitioner Reyes, the evidence shows that at the time of the disaster, he had
in his possession cash in the sum of P2,900.00 and personal belongings worth
P100.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, due to the disaster,
Reyes was unable to work for three months due to shock and he was earning P9.50
a day or in a total sum of P855.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also, he spent about P100.00 for court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For such losses and
incidental expenses at the trial of this case, <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>
should pay the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> amounts to the petitioners
as actual damages.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Reyes’ claim for moral damages cannot be granted inasmuch as the
same is not recoverable in damage action based on the breach of contract of
transportation under Articles 2219 and 2220 of the New Civil Code except (1)
where the mishap resulted in the death of a passenger and (2) where it is
proved that the carrier was guilty of fraud or bad faith, even if death does
not result (Rex Taxicab Co., Inc. v. Bautista, 109 Phil. 712).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The exceptions do not apply in this case
since Reyes survived the incident and no evidence was presented to show that <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> was guilty of bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere carelessness of the carrier does not <u>per</u>
<u>se</u> constitute or justify an inference of malice or bad faith on its part
(Rex Taxicab Co., Inc. v. Bautista, <u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the claim for exemplary damages, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are not inclined to grant the same in the absence of gross or reckless
negligence in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the claim for attorney's fees, the records reveal that
the petitioners engaged the services of a lawyer and agreed to pay the sum of
P3,000.00 each on a contingent basis (see <span class="SpellE">TSN's</span>, July
21, 1971, p. 24; November 3, 1971, pp. 18 and 29).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view hereof, We find the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as a reasonable compensation for the legal services
rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appealed decision is hereby REVERSED and
judgment is hereby rendered sentencing the private respondent to pay the
following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) P30,000.00 as indemnity
for death to the heirs of each of the victims; (2) P10,000.00 as moral damages
