<p class="BODY">This is a case for the recovery of a Ford-Trader cargo truck,
allegedly, unlawfully seized by the agents of G.A. Machineries, Inc. (GAMI for
short).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This said cargo truck, on <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1964</st1:date>, was sold by GAMI
to <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagmay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Masilungan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the right to the same was
bought by <span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span> <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
the latter assuming the unpaid purchase price of P20<span class="GramE">,454.74</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In so doing, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
executed in favor of GAMI a promissory note and a chattel mortgage over the
said truck (Partial Stipulation of Facts, par. 4, Record on Appeal, p.
99).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On February 20, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> having defaulted in his obligation and GAMI having
granted his request for extension, a new chattel mortgage and a new promissory
note were executed (Ibid., pars. 5 and 6, pp. 99-100) to secure the unpaid
balance of P16<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> plus 1% per month, payable in
monthly installments of P1,000.00, the first installment to be due on March 15,
1966 and the succeeding monthly installments on the 15th day of each
month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1966</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> had paid
GAMI the total sum of P1<span class="GramE">,297.00</span> (Ibid., par. 7, p.

Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">TG-64.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the said complaint, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> alleged, among
others, that due to his failure to pay the installments due, the agents of
GAMI, Jose <span class="SpellE">Tino</span> and Samuel <span class="SpellE">Dore</span>,
representing themselves as deputy sheriffs and with use of force, threats and

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">GAMI, et al. filed their

allowed to recover its possession upon payment of his back accounts (Record on
Appeal p. 102).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the lower

<blockquote>"Since it is admitted that <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
was in arrears in the payment of his account, the G.A. Machineries, Inc.
therefore could exercise its option under the contract of mortgage to take possession
of the truck without court action as long as the mortgagor agreed (Luna vs. <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>, G.R. L-4637, June 30, 1952).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having chosen this remedy however, the
mortgagee has no further action against <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> to
recover the unpaid balance of the purchase price (Art. 1484, (3), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Civil </span>Code of the Phil.).</blockquote>

</span>However, said appellate court, took exception to <span class="SpellE">GAMI's</span>
failure to sell at public auction said truck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It held that while it is true that under the chattel mortgage contract,
the mortgagee can take possession of </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"Should the vendee or purchaser of a personal property default
in the payment of two or more of the agreed installments, the vendor or seller
has the option to avail of any one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>these

constituted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These remedies have been
recognized as alternative, not cumu</span>lative, that the exercise of one
would bar the exer<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cise of the
others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may also be stated that the
established rule is to the effect that the foreclosure and actual sale of a
mortgaged chattel bars further recovery by the vendor of any balance on the
purchaser's outstanding obligation not so satisfied by the s</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">le."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be observed, however, that the award of exemplary damages
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>apparently unwarranted, there
being no showing that the mortgagee acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless or
oppressive manner (Dee <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>

did not find blatant fault on the part of the mortgagee for not immediately
proceeding with the foreclosure of the mortgage, especially so where the filing
of the instant case has put a legal obstacle to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the <span class="SpellE">otherhand</span>,
the appellate court is of the view and rightly so that the mortgagee should
have immediately foreclosed the mortgage and offered the truck for sale at
public auction as provided under the chattel mortgage contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled, that under the chattel mortgage contract,
the mortgagee is expressly authorized to sell the mortgaged property and the
mortgagee had already commenced foreclosure of the chattel mortgage (par. 13,
amended answer) but the sale presumably could not be immediately made because
of the request of the mortgagor himself to give him a chance to settle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>account.</p>
