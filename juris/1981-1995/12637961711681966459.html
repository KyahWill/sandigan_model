<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of
the criminal case against the accused employee wipes out not only the employee's
primary civil liability, but also his employer's subsidiary liability for such
criminal negligence, because:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">‘a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The criminal case is based on Article 100 of

liability implies exemption from civil liability arising from crime.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">‘b.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The civil liability of the employer
petitioner is based, if any, on quasi <span class="SpellE">delict</span>, since
the accused was exempted from criminal liability.</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exemplary damages
cannot be imposed upon an employer who at the time of the alleged incident was
not present nor inside the vehicle involved in the accident.</blockquote>

employer cannot be condemned (to pay) an <span class="SpellE">exhorbitant</span>
amount of damages to the tune of P1,417,946.89, without giving him opportunity
to cross examine the witness supporting such claim and affording him
opportunity to adduce evidence to resist the claim, because that would be
deprivation of property without due process of law repug­nant to the Freedom
Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Honorable
Intermediate Appellate Court misapplied the facts contrary to the physical
evidence and relied on conjectures and surmises that depicted a different
picture of the accident when the evidence shows that it was the victim who was
negligent at the time of the accident." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 18-19)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first contention of petitioner that the death of the
accused-employee wipes out not only the employee's primary civil liability but
also his employer's subsi­diary liability is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The death of the accused during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of his appeal or before the judgment of conviction
(rendered against him by the lower court) became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
<span class="SpellE">entinguished</span> his criminal liability (meaning his
obligation to serve the imprisonment imposed and his pecuniary liability for
fines, but not his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">civil </span>liability
should the lia­bility or obligation arise (not from a crime, for here, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">no </span>crime was committed, the accused
not having been convicted by final judgment, and therefore still regarded as
innocent) but from a <u>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></u> (See Arts.
2176 and 2177, Civil Code), as in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The liability of the employer here would not be subsidiary but <span class="SpellE"><u>solidary</u></span> with his driver (unless said employer can
prove there was no negligence on his part at all, that is, if he can prove due
diligence in the selection and supervision of his driver).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See 8th par. of Art. 2180, Art. 2194, Civil
Code; also People vs. <span class="SpellE">Navoa</span>, 132 SCRA 412; People vs.

82 SCRA 120).</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the employer (petitioner herein) was not a party in
the criminal case, and to grant him his day in court for the purpose of
cross-examining the prosecution witnesses on their testimonies on the dri­ver's
alleged negligence and the amount of damages to which the heirs of the victim
are entitled, as well as to introduce any evidence or witnesses he may care to
present in his defense, the hearing on the motion to quash the subsidiary writ
of execution must be re­opened precisely for the purpose adverted to
hereinabove.</p>
