				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This complaint for disbarment is related to the administrative case
which complainant Attorney Fernando T. <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span>,
house counsel for V &amp; G Better Homes Subdivision, Inc. (V &amp; G for
short), filed against Attorney Vicente C. <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span>,
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City, for the latter's
irregular actuations with regard to the application of V &amp; G <span style="">for </span>registration of 163 <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
Deeds of Absolute Sale with Assignment of lots in its subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present complaint charges the respondent
with the following offenses:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neglecting or refusing <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
(sic) repeated requests and without sufficient justification, to act within
reasonable time (sic) the registration of 163 Deeds of Absolute Sale with
Assignment <span class="GramE">and</span> the eventual issuance and transfer of
the corresponding 163 transfer certificates of titles to the GSIS, for the
purpose of obtaining some pecuniary or material benefit from the person or
persons interested therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conduct unbecoming of public official.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dishonesty.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Extortion.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Directly receiving pecuniary or material
benefit for <span class="GramE">himself</span> in connection with pending
official transaction before him.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Causing undue injury to a party, the GSIS [or]
Government through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable
negligence.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gross ignorance of the law and procedure.”</span>
<span class="GramE">(p. 10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As early as <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="1">January 15,
 1987</st1:date>, V &amp; G had requested the respondent Register of Deeds to
register some 163 deeds of sale with assignment (in favor of the GSIS) of lots
of the V &amp; G mortgaged to GSIS by the lot buyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no action from the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another request was made on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1987</st1:date> for him to approve or deny registration
of the uniform deeds of absolute sale with assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Still no action, except to
require V &amp; G to submit proof of real estate tax payment and to clarify
certain details about the transactions.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although V &amp; G complied with the desired requirements,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span> suspended the registration of
the documents pending compliance by V &amp; G with a certain "special
arrangement" between them, which was that V &amp; G should provide him
with a weekly round trip ticket from <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> to
Manila plus P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as pocket money per trip, or, in
lieu thereof, the sale of respondent's <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
house and lot by V &amp; G or GSIS representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1987</st1:date>,
respondent confided to the complainant that he would act favorably on the 163 <span class="SpellE">registrable</span> documents of V &amp; G if the latter would
execute <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> affidavits and send money for a
round trip plane ticket for him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plane fare amounting to P800 (without the pocket money of P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>) was sent to respondent through his niece.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of V &amp; G's failure to give him pocket money in
addition to plane fare, respondent imposed additional registration
requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fed up with the
respondent's extortionate tactics, the complainant wrote him a letter on <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1987</st1:date> challenging him to act
on all pending applications for registration of V &amp; G within twenty-four
(24) hours.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1987</st1:date>,
respondent formally denied registration of the transfer of 163 certificates of
title to the GSIS on the uniform ground that the deeds of absolute sale with
assignment were ambiguous as to parties and subject matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="5">May
 26, 1987</st1:date>, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span> moved for a
reconsideration of said denial, stressing that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
since the year 1973 continuously up to December 1986 for a period of nearly
fifteen (15) years or for a sum total of more than 2,000 same set of documents
which have been repeatedly and uniformly registered in the Office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City under Attys.
Modesto Garcia and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Amascual</span>, Jr., it is only
during the incumbency of Atty. Vicente C. <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span>,
that the very same documents of the same tenor have been refused or denied
registration x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." <span class="GramE">(p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1987</st1:date>,
respondent elevated the matter <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span>
to the Administrator, National Land Titles and Deeds Registration
Administration (NLTDRA) (now the Land Registration Authority [LRA]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1987</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Consulta</span>
No. 1579), the NLTDRA ruled that the questioned documents were <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Heedless of <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">NLTDRA's</span> opinion, respondent continued to sit on V &amp;
G's 163 deeds of sale with assignment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Exasperated by respondent's conduct, the complainant filed with
the NLTDRA on <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1987</st1:date>
administrative charges (docketed as Adm. Case No. 87-15), against respondent
Register of Deeds.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the charges, NLTDRA Administrator <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> directed
respondent to explain in writing why no administrative disciplinary action
should be taken against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
was further asked whether he would submit his case on the basis of his answer,
or be heard in a formal investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer dated <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="7">July
 9, 1987</st1:date>, respondent denied the charges of extortion and of directly
receiving pecuniary or material benefit for himself in connection with the
official transactions awaiting his action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although an investigator was appointed by NLTDRA Administrator <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> to hear Attorney <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span>'
charges against him, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span> waived his
right to a formal investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
parties submitted the case for resolution based on the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigator, Attorney Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Da</span>
Jose, recommended dropping the charges of:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) dishonesty; (2) causing undue injury to a party through manifest<span style=""> </span>partiality, evident bad faith or gross
inexcusable negligence; and (3) gross ignorance of the law and procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He opined that the charge of neglecting or
refusing, in spite repeated requests and without sufficient justification, to
act within a reasonable time on the registration of the documents involved, in
order to extort some pecuniary or material benefit from the interested party,
absorbed the charges of conduct unbecoming of a public official, extortion, and
directly receiving some pecuniary or material benefit for himself in connection
with pending official transactions before him.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Brushing aside the investigator's recommendation, NLTDRA
Administrator <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
on February 22, 1988, recommended to Secretary of Justice <span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span> that the respondent:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) be found guilty of simple neglect of
duty; (2) be reprimanded to act with dispatch on documents presented to him for
registration; and (3) be warned that a repetition of similar infraction will be
dealt with more severely.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due investigation of the charges, Secretary <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span> found respondent guilty of grave misconduct.</p>

<blockquote>"Our study and consideration of the records of the case
indicate that ample evidence supports the Investigating Officer's findings that
the respondent committed grave misconduct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent unreasonably delayed action on the documents
presented to him for registration and, notwithstanding representations by the
parties interested for expeditious action on the said documents, he continued
with his inaction.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The records indicate that the respondent eventually formally
denied the registration of the documents involved; that he himself elevated the
question on the <span class="SpellE">registrability</span> of the said documents
to Administrator <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> after he formally denied
the registration thereof; that the Administrator then resolved in favor of the <span class="SpellE">registrability</span> of the said documents in question; and that,
such resolution of the Administrator notwithstanding, the respondent still
refused the registration thereof but demanded from the parties interested the
submission of additional <span class="SpellE">requirementls</span> not adverted
to in his previous denial.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In relation to the alleged 'special arrangement,' although
the respondent claims that he neither­ touched nor received the money sent to
him, on record remains <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> the
circumstance that his niece, Ms. de la Cruz, <span style="">retrieved </span>from him the amount of P800.00 earlier sent to him as
plane fare, not in the original denomination of P100.00 bills but in P50.00
bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent had ample
opportunity to clarify or to countervail this related incident in his letter
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="9">5 September 1987</st1:date> to
Administrator <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> but he never did so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">We</span> believe that, in this case, the respondent's being new in
office cannot serve to mitigate his liability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His being so should have motivated him to be more aware of applicable
laws, rules and regulations and should have prompted him to do his best in the
discharge of his duties." <span class="GramE">(pp. 17-18, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Secretary <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span> recommended to
President Corazon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> that <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span>
be dismissed from the service, with forfeiture of leave credits and retirement
benefits, and with prejudice to re-employment in the government service,
effective immediately.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As recommended by the Secretary of Justice, the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
by Adm. Order No. 165 dated <st1:date year="1990" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1990</st1:date>,
dismissed the respondent from the government service (pp. 14-19, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Less than two weeks after filing his complaint against <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span> in the NLTDRA, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span>
also filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="6">June 16,
 1987</st1:date>, a disbarment complaint against said respondent.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue in this disbarment proceeding is whether the respondent
register of deeds, as a lawyer, may also be disciplined by this Court for his
malfeasances as a public official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
answer is yes, for his misconduct as a public official also constituted a
violation of his oath as a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lawyer's oath (Rule 138, Section 17, Rules of Court: People
vs. De Luna, 102 Phil. 968), imposes upon every lawyer the duty to delay no man
for money or malice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer's oath
is a source of his obligations and <u>its</u> <u>violation</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u>
<u>ground</u> <u>for</u> <u>his</u> <u>suspension,</u> <u>disbarment</u> <u>or</u>
<u>other</u> <u>disciplinary</u> <u>action</u> (Legal Ethics, Ruben E. <span class="SpellE">Agpalo</span>, 1983 Edition, pp. 66-67).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As the late Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro said:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A person takes an oath when he is admitted to the Bar which
is designed to impress upon him his responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thereby becomes an ‘officer of the court’
on whose <span class="GramE">shoulders rests</span> the grave responsibility of
assisting the courts in the proper, fair, speedy and efficient administration
of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an officer of the court
he is subject to a rigid discipline that demands that in his every exertion the
only criterion be that truth and justice triumph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This discipline is what has given the law
profession its nobility, its prestige, its exalted place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>From</u> <u>a</u> <u>lawyer,</u> <u>to</u>
<u>paraphrase</u> <u>Justice</u> <u>Felix</u> <u>Frankfurter,</u> <u>are</u> <u>expected</u>
<u>those</u> <u>qualities</u> <u>of</u> <u>truth-speaking,</u> <u>a</u> <u>high</u>
<u>sense</u> <u>of</u> <u>honor,</u> <u>full</u> <u>candor,</u> <u>intellectual</u>
<u>honesty,</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>strictest</u> <u>observance</u> <u>of</u>
<u>fiduciary</u> <u>responsibility</u> <u>-</u> <u>all</u> <u>of</u> <u>which,</u>
<u>throughout</u> <u>the</u> <u>centuries,</u> <u>have</u> <u>been</u> <u>compendiously</u>
<u>described</u> <u>as</u> <u>'moral</u> <u>character.'</u></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>"Membership</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Bar</u> <u>is</u> <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>category</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>mandate</u> <u>to</u> <u>public</u>
<u>service</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>highest</u> <u>order</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lawyer is an oath-bound servant of society whose
conduct is clearly circumscribed by inflexible norms of law and ethics, and
whose primary duty is the advancement of the quest of truth and justice, for
which he has sworn to be a fearless crusader." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Apostacy</span> in the Legal Profession, 64 SCRA 784, 789-790;
underscoring supplied.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Code of Professional Responsibility applies to lawyers in
government service in the discharge of their official tasks (Canon 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as the Code of Conduct and Ethical
Standards for Public Officials requires public officials and employees to
process documents and <span style="">papers
expeditiously (Sec. 5, <span class="SpellE">subpars</span>. [c] and [d]) and
prohibits them from directly or indirectly having a financial or material
interest in any transaction requiring the approval of their office, and
likewise bars them from soliciting gifts or anything of monetary value in the
course of any transaction which may be affected by the functions of their
office (Sec. 7, <span class="SpellE">subpars</span>. [<span class="GramE">a</span>]
and [d]), the Code of Professional Responsibility forbids a lawyer to engage in
unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct (Rule 1.01, Code of
Professional Responsibility), or delay any man's cause "for any corrupt
motive or interest" (Rule 1.03).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A lawyer shall not engage <span style="">in </span>conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice
law, <u>nor</u> <u>shall</u> <u>he,</u> <u>whether</u> <u>in</u> <u>public</u> <u>or</u>
<u>private</u> <u>life,</u> <u>behave</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>scandalous</u> <u>manner</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>discredit</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>legal</u> <u>profession</u>."
(Rule 7.03, Code of Professional Responsibility.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court has ordered that only those who are "competent,
honorable, and reliable" may practice the profession of law (Noriega vs. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, 125 SCRA 293) for every lawyer must pursue
"only the highest standards in the practice of his calling" (Court
Administrator vs. <span class="SpellE">Hermoso</span>, 150 SCRA 269, 278).</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts of dishonesty and oppression which Attorney <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span> committed as a public official have demonstrated
his unfitness to practice the high and noble calling of the law (Bautista vs.
Judge <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, <span style="">142
SCRA 632; Court Administrator </span><span style="">vs.
</span><span style="">Rodolfo G.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Hermoso</span>, 150
SCRA 269).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should therefore be
disbarred.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, it is hereby ordered that Attorney Vicente C. <span class="SpellE">Renomeron</span> be disbarred from the practice of law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
