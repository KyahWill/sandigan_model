spouses Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Albios</span>, their daughter <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Albios</span>, and nieces Ester <span class="SpellE">Tangcay</span>
and Delia Villa, attended the inauguration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of a new school building in <span class="SpellE">Bagwa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sibutad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte. As part of the celebration, a dance was held attended
by the residents of the community. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> and
his family left the dance at about </span><st1:time hour="14" minute="0"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">two o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> in the morning of </span><st1:date month="6" day="25" year="1972"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June 25, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> and proceeded for their residence. As it was
showering, <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> wore a hat, her husband's loafer
and a towel. Domingo covered himself with a banana leaf only, while their other
companions did not have anything on to protect themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While they were walking home in a column, with <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> leading the way,
they heard an explosion or a gunshot. Immediately, Domingo and his companions,
except <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>, hid themselves <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in </span>the bushes nearest them, and almost simultaneously they heard
<span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> saying: "<span class="SpellE">Aguy</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Domingo, I was hit." From his hiding
place, Domingo saw his wife <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> turn around and
fall to the ground. As he was not armed, Domingo ran home to inform the members
of his family that <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> was shot. Likewise, he was
able to report the matter to the policeman who was on duty at the dance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> died on the spot. Her body was
taken to the <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> residence where they found her
wounded at the left side of her back thru the front of the abdomen. Her body
was not examined by a physician before she was buried at the municipal <st1:place><st1:placetype>cemetery</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sibutad</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">The incident was brought to the attention of the Chief of Police
who, together with Patrolmen Palma and <span class="SpellE">Necesario</span>,
went to the scene of the crime immediately after they had received the
information. As the body of the victim was no longer there, they proceeded to
her residence. It came out from the investigation conducted by the said peace
officers that <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>
was a para­mour of one <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>.
As a consequence, said <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> was brought to the
police station where he was investigated and admitted that he hired one Rogelio
<span class="SpellE">Perio-­Perio</span> to shoot Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>,
husband of <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>. In the process, it was <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> who was hit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Chief of Police had <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span>
located and, upon investigation, the latter admitted that he was hired by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> to shoot
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>, husband of <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span> also revealed that it was a home­made<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> shotgun he used in shooting the victim. <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> indicated to
the authorities the place where he hid the fatal weapon. The Chief of Police,
together with Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Balisado</span>, went to the place
indicated (in the plantation owned by a certain <span class="SpellE">Cabilin</span>)
and there they found the weapon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">An information</span> for murder was filed
against Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span>, and only against him
because <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>
died when he was detained in the municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Sibutad</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span> denied his
alleged participation in the commission of the crime charged. In fact, he
claimed that he did not even know where <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagwa</span> is, much less has he ever been there. He admitted his
signature in the document, marked Exhibit "E", but contended that he
had to sign it because the policemen told him that he would be killed if he
would refuse. He was not even asked questions but was only presented with the
said document <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for his signature.
Likewise, he denied having been brought to the Office of Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabasa</span>. It was in the
Office of the Chief of Police where he saw the judge. He also denied the
statement imputed to him that <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> offered him P100.00 to shoot Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>; and, regarding the weapon used in the commission of
the crime, he saw it for the first time only in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the accused <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span>
was rebutted by Patrolman Mario <span class="SpellE">Calizo</span> saying that it
was the Chief of Police who investigated herein accused, and that he did not
maltreat or force the latter to sign Exhibit "E."</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span> guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime
charged in the information. The commission of the crime, however, was attended
with treachery, and as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Penal Code, the penalty imposable is
reclusion temporal in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">its </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">maximum period to death. As there are no
mitigating and no aggravating cir­cumstances to consider, the penalty to be
imposed should be in its medium period.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span> is
hereby sentenced to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"He </span>is further
sentenced to suffer all the accessory penalties provided for by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He is further sentenced <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to
</span>pay the heirs of the victim P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as
indemnity for the death of the victim; P10,000.00 for moral damages; P10,000.00
for exemplary damages and P5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"He is further </span>sentenced
to pay the cost.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As detained prisoner he is entitled to all his preventive
imprisonment if he will agree in writing to abide by all the rules and regu­lations
provided for convicted persons, other­wise he will be entitled to only
four-fifths <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(4/5) thereof. The firearm,
a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">homemade shotgun </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">paliuntod</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> used in the commission is hereby ordered
confiscated in favor of the state and turned over to the Philippine </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Constabulary for proper disposition."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court said that even if it were to disregard the
extrajudicial confession, the following facts appeared <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"(<span class="GramE">a</span>) That on <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="6">June 25,
 1972</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Abao</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> was shot while on her way home from a dance
at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bagacay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place> and died <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on </span>the spot. Her body was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">later </span>taken to her home where police
authorities saw and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">examined it.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(<span class="GramE">b</span>) That the accused <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> had an 'affair of the heart' with the deceased <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Abao</span> de <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c) That there was
a prior attempt to eliminate Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d) That
immediately before the shooting of <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>, the
accused <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>
was seen by witness <span class="SpellE">Warlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Embrado</span>
talking with accused Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span>. <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> was pointing to
accused, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">at several directions around them;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(e) That <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> was shot and killed
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">near </span>the spot where both accused
had been seen talking, the previous day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(f) That accused
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span> was then living with the accused,
now deceased, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(g) That accused
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span>, before his affidavit
(confession) was <span class="GramE">taken,</span> he admitted his participation
in the commission<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">crime.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(h) He admitted
that he was offered by his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">then </span>co-accused
<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> the sum
of P100.00 to shoot Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) Instead of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>
being shot and killed, it was <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>, the paramour of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> who was killed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(j) That the death
weapon, Exhibit ‘F’ was found by the authorities where both Jumawan <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and <span class="SpellE">Perio<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">-Perio</span></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> said <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> hid
it in the mud in a rice field. This particular fact belied the claim of the
accused that he did not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">know </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">anything about the death weapon. As hidden,
it was impossible to find that '<span class="SpellE">paliuntod</span>' unless the
person or persons who hid it were to locate it themselves. Therefore, it is
clear that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">accused, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span>
knew where the gun was hidden, otherwise he could not have divulged its exact
location to the police authorities." (pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appealing to Us, <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span> alleged
that the trial court erred (1) in finding that appellant, before his alleged
extrajudicial confession was taken, had admitted his participation in the
commission of the crime and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">offered by his then co-accused <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> a sum of money to shoot Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>;
and, (2) in finding that appellant knew where the deadly weapon was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Going over the records <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of </span>the
case, it is clear that prosecution witnesses, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>, who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">were </span>then with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">bring to ourselves the </span>relevance

In the first place, <span class="SpellE">Embrado</span> did not hear </span>what <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the two were talking about. On the contrary,
he could only guess that they were referring to the tethering of their <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>. Secondly, it is hard to believe that <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> knew at the time that the <span class="SpellE">Albios</span>

<p class="BODY">Then, there is the Chief of Police, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Camaso</span>, who testified that when he investigated <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>, the latter
pointed to herein appellant as the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">one </span>who
fired the shot intended for Domingo, but instead, hit <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>.
Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Perio-Perio</span> was brought in for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">investigation </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">and </span>the latter allegedly admitted in writing (Exhibit
"E") that <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> hired him for P100.00 to
shoot and kill Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> because the latter's
wife was <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Jumawan's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> mistress. </span>Further, <span class="SpellE">Camaso</span> declared that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">
<span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span> pointed to him the place where he hid the
weapon used in the shooting of the victim - in the coconut plantation of a
certain <span class="SpellE">Cabilin</span>. Accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>
they went </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the place and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

shotgun (Exhibit "F").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only evidence which would pin appellant to the case at bar
are his statement (Exhibit "E") and the recovery of the firearm
(Exhibit "F"). Relative thereto, <span class="GramE">We</span> are
dubious of appellant's guilt because -</p>

<blockquote>1. Why would <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>, a married man, plot the assassination of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Albios</span> when the latter is the offended party in the alleged
liaison of the former with <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>, a mother of ten
(10) <span class="GramE">children.</span> The reverse would be more natural and
logical. And, there is no certainty that <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">is </span>really the mistress of <span class="SpellE">Jumawan</span>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

was arrested and detained he obtained injuries during his investigation and
signing of Exhibit "E". In his decision, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

according to him were scars of the wound when he was hit with the pistol butt
by Patrolman Mario <span class="SpellE">Caliso</span> who warned him that he will
kill him if he will not sign the confes­sion or if he will tell the judge that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
