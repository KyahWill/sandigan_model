<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing application and joint deposition,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> issued Search Warrant No. 181,
commanding the search of the property described in the warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, constabulary officers stationed in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City conducted <span style="">a </span>search of the premises described in the search warrant and
seized the following articles, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1) 272 kilos of galvanized bolts, V chuckle and U-bolts; and 2) 3 and
1/2 feet angular bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipt was

Pc. Sergeant and marked “from Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Siao</span>” p. 21, <u>Record</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">A complaint for violation of the Anti-Fencing Law (P.D. 1612) was
filed against Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Siao</span> with the office of the
City Fiscal by the National Power Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Siao</span> filed a counter-affidavit
alleging that he had previously relinquished all his rights and ownership over
the <span class="SpellE">Kener</span> Trading to herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Erle</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution (pp. 22-23, <u>Record</u>)
dated May 18, 1987, the office of the City Fiscal recommended the dismissal of
the complaint against <span class="SpellE">Siao</span> and the filing of a
complaint for the same violation against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, a complaint (p. 24, <u>Record</u>)
for Violation of the Anti-Fencing Law was filed against petitioner and docketed
as Criminal Case No. 5657 of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case <span style="">was </span>raffled to Branch 47 of the same
court presided over by respondent Judge Enrique T. <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before his arraignment, petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1987</st1:date>, an application for the return of the
articles seized by virtue of Search Warrant No. 181 (pp. 26-29, Record) on the
ground that the said search warrant was illegally issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecuting fiscal filed an opposition to
the application (pp. 31-32, Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
application was subsequently amended to an application for <span class="SpellE">quashal</span>
of the illegally-issued search warrant and for the return of the articles
seized by virtue thereof (pp. 33-38, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1987</st1:date>,
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> issued an order impliedly
denying the application for the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span> of the search
warrant without ruling on the issue of the validity of the issuance
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order states:</p>

<blockquote>“Counsel for accused having admitted in the hearing in open court
that at least one of the seized items bears the identifying mark of the
complainant National Power Corporation, and there being no statement that the
seized items were acquired in usual course of business for value, this court is
constrained to have the case tried without resolving whether or not the
questioned search warrant was issued validly.” (p. 43, Records)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioner but it was
denied on <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1987</st1:date>
(p. 11, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1987</st1:date>,
petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari,</i>
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> with a prayer for a restraining order,
assailing the legality of search warrant No. 181 and praying for the permanent
prohibition against the use in evidence of the articles and properties seized
and the return thereof to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1988</st1:date>, respondent
Court of Appeals dismissed the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellate court found the existence of a probable cause to justify
the issuance of the search warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent court held:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“For reasons indicated, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the
evidence was sufficient to sustain the validity of the issuance of the Search
Warrant No. 181 and to sustain further the ruling of the respondent trial court

seized <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, this petition is hereby DISMISSED, with costs against

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SO ORDERED.”</span> (p. 41, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span><u>)<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration of the above decision filed by
petitioner on <st1:date year="1988" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1988</st1:date>
was denied in <span style="">a </span>resolution (p.
49, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) dated <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue raised in this petition <span style="">is </span>the legality of the issuance of Search Warrant No. 181.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the contention of petitioner that the
application for the search warrant and the joint deposition of the witnesses miserably
failed to fulfill the requirements prescribed by the Constitution and the
rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues that the application of 1st Lt. Rojas and
the joint deposition of <span class="SpellE">Abaja</span> and Reyes failed to
comply with the requisites of searching questions and answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The joint deposition of the witnesses showed
that the questions therein <span style="">were </span>pre-typed,
mimeographed and the answers of the witnesses were merely filled-in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No examination of the applicant and of the
joint deponents was personally conducted by Judge <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>
as required by law and the rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, petitioner also contends that both the application
of Rojas and the joint deposition of <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> and Reyes
show that neither of the affiants had personal knowledge that any specific
offense <span style="">was </span>committed by
petitioner or that the articles sought to be seized were stolen or that being
so, they were brought to Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Siao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the petitioner contends that, even assuming for the sake
of polemics, that the articles belong to the latter, his Constitutional right
prevails over that of NAPOCOR.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right against unreasonable searches and seizures is
guaranteed under Article 111 (Bill of Rights), <span style="">Section </span>2 of the 1987 Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“Sec. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers
and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and
for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant <span style="">or </span>warrant of arrest shall <span style="">issue </span>except upon probable cause to be
determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation
of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly
describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the above provision, the issuance of a search warrant is
justified upon a finding of probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Probable cause for a search has been defined as such facts and
circumstances which would lead a reasonably <span style="">discreet </span>and prudent man to believe that an offense has been
committed and that the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the
place sought to be searched (Burgos, Sr. v. Chief of Staff, G.R. No. 64261,
Dec. 26, 1984, 133 SCRA 800).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
determining the existence of probable cause, it is required that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) the judge (or) officer must examine the **
witnesses personally; 2) the examination must be under oath; and (3) the
examination must be reduced to writing in the form of searching questions and
answers (Marinas v. <span class="SpellE">Sioco</span>, 104 SCRA 403, <span class="SpellE">Ponsica</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ignalaga</span>, G.R. No.
72301, July 31, 1987, 152 SCRA 647).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These requirements are provided under Section 4, Rule 126 of the New
Rules of Criminal Procedure which states:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>“Sec. 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Examination</u>
<u>of</u> <u>complainant;</u> <u>record</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The judge must, before issuing the warrant,
personally examine in the form of searching questions and answers, in writing
and under oath the complainant and the witnesses he may produce on facts
personally known to them and attach to the record their sworn statements
together with any affidavits submitted.”</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been ruled that the existence of probable cause depends to
a large degree upon the finding or opinion of the judge conducting the
examination (Luna v. Plaza, G.R. No. L-27511, <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="11">Nov. 29, 1968</st1:date>), however, the opinion or finding of
probable cause must, to a certain degree, be substantiated or supported by the
record.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the
requirement mandated by the law and the rules that the judge must personally
examine the applicant and his witnesses in the form of <u>searching</u> <u>questions</u>
<u>and</u> <u>answers</u> before issuing the warrant, was not sufficiently
complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicant himself was
not asked any searching question by Judge <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records disclose that the only part
played by the applicant, Lieutenant Rojas was to subscribe the application
before Judge <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application contained pre-typed
questions, none of which stated that applicant had personal knowledge of a
robbery or <span style="">a </span>theft and that the
proceeds thereof are in the possession and control of the person against whom
the search warrant was sought to be issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of Roan v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 71410, Nov. 25, 1986, 145 SCRA
687, citing the case of Mata v. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, G.R. No.
50720, March 26, 1984, 128 SCRA 388, where the applicant himself was not
subjected to an interrogation but was questioned only “to ascertain, among
others, if he knew and understood (his affidavit) and only because the
application was not yet subscribed and sworn to,” We held that:</p>

<blockquote>“Mere affidavits of the complainant and his witnesses are thus not sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examining Judge has to take depositions
in writing of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce and attach them
to the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Such
written deposition is necessary in order that the Judge may be able to properly
determine the existence or non-existence of the probable cause, to hold liable
for perjury the person giving it if it will be found later that his
declarations are false.’</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<u>It</u> <u>is</u> <u>axiomatic</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>examination</u>
<u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>probing</u> <u>and</u> <u>exhaustive,</u> <u>not</u> <u>merely</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>routinary</u></span> <u>or</u> <u>pro</u> <u>forma,</u> <u>if</u>
<u>the</u> <u>claimed</u> <u>probable</u> <u>cause</u> <u>is</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u>
<u>established.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>examining</u>
<u>magistrate</u> <u>must</u> <u>not</u> <u>simply</u> <u>rehash</u> <u>the</u>
<u>contents</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>affidavit</u> <u>but</u> <u>must</u> <u>make</u>
<u>his</u> <u>own</u> <u>inquiry</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>intent</u> <u>and</u>
<u>justification</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>application</u>.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="GramE">underscoring</span>
supplied; p. 695)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the joint deposition made by the two (2) witnesses
presented by the applicant can hardly satisfy the same requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public respondent prosecutor admitted in <span style="">his </span>memorandum that the questions
propounded were pre-typed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The offense which petitioner was sought to be charged was
violation of the anti-fencing law which punishes the act of any person who,
with intent to gain for himself or for another, shall buy, receive, possess,
keep, acquire, conceal, sell or dispose of, or shall buy or sell, or in any
other manner deal in any article, item, object or anything of value which he
knows, or should have known to him, to have been derived from the proceeds of
the crime of robbery or theft (Sec. 2a, P. D. 1612).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four (4) questions propounded could
hardly support a finding of probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first question was on the personal circumstances of the
deponents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second and third were
leading questions answerable by yes or no.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fourth question was on how the deponents knew about their answers in
the second and third questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judge could have exploited this last question to convince himself of the
existence of <span style="">a </span>probable cause
but he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also no
statement in the joint deposition that the articles sought to be seized were
derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or a theft or that applicants
have any knowledge that <span style="">a </span>robbery
or theft was committed and the articles sought to be seized were the proceeds
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not even shown what
connection Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Siao</span> has with <span class="SpellE">Kener</span>
Trading or with the premises sought to be searched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By and large, neither the application nor the
joint deposition provided facts or circumstance which could lead <span style="">a </span>prudent man to believe that an
offense had been committed and that the objects sought in connection with the
offense, if any, are in the possession of the person named <span style="">in </span>the application.</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> [T]he searching questions propounded to the
applicants of the search warrant and his witnesses must depend to a large
extent upon the discretion of the Judge just as long as the answers establish <span style="">a </span>reasonable ground to believe the
commission of a specific offense and that the applicant is one authorized by
law, and said answers particularly describe with certainty the place to be
searched and the persons or things to be seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination or investigation which must
be under oath may not be in public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may even be held in the secrecy of his chambers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Far</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>more</u> <u><span style="">important</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>is</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u><span style="">examination</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>or</u>

must be in writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Meta v. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, 50720, March 26, 1984, 128 SCRA 388) (<span class="GramE">underlining</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">And, in Quintero v. NBI, G.R. No.</span>
L-35149, <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1988</st1:date>, 162
SCRA 467, 483:</p>

<blockquote>“As held in <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Paño</span> No. 69803, October 8, 1985, 139 SCRA 163), the
questions propounded by respondent Executive Judge to the applicant’s witness
are not sufficiently searching to establish probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asking of leading questions to the deponent
in an application for search warrant, and conducting of examination in a
general manner, would not satisfy the requirements for issuance of a valid
search warrant.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Another infirmity of Search Warrant No. 181 is its generality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law requires that the articles sought to
be seized must be described with particularity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The items listed in the warrant, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>“NAPOCOR Galvanized bolts, grounding motor drive assembly, aluminum
wires and other <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">NAPOCOR</span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Towers</span></st1:placetype></st1:place>
parts and line accessories” are so general that the searching team can
practically take half of the business of <span class="SpellE">Kener</span>
Trading, the premises searched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kener</span> Trading, <span style="">as </span>alleged
in petitioner’s petition before respondent Court of Appeals and which has not
been denied by respondent, is engaged in the business of buying and selling
scrap metals, second hand spare parts and accessories and empty bottles.</p>

<p class="BODY">Far more important is that the items described in the application
do not fall under the list of personal property which may be seized under
Section 2, Rule 126 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure because neither the
application nor the joint deposition alleged that the item/s sought to be
seized were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) the subject of an
offense; b) stolen or embezzled property and other proceeds or fruits of an
offense; and c) used or intended to be used as <span style="">a </span>means of committing an offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noted that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>
himself had doubts about the existence of probable cause in the issuance of the
search warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In denying petitioner’s
motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion to quash and application
for articles seized by virtue of search warrant No. 181, he stated:</p>

<blockquote>“The <u>seeming</u> <u>lack</u> <u>of</u> <u>probable</u> <u>cause</u>
<u>during</u> <u>the</u> <u>application</u> <u>for</u> <u>search</u> <u>warrant</u>
in the lower court is cured by the admission for the accused of counsel that at
least one of the items seized bore the identifying mark of complainant National
Power Corporation and the failure to aver in the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span>
motion and in the open hearing that the seized items themselves were acquired
in the usual course of business for value in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this order is without prejudice to
the right of the accused to pursue against the administrative liability of MTCC
Judge Demosthenes <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>.” (p. 54, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his memorandum, City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Mirano</span>
stated that the articles seized by virtue of search warrant No. 181 <span style="">was </span>taken from the possession of
petitioner who signed the receipt in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Kener</span>
Trading, which possession is punishable under Section 5, <span style="">P.D. 1612, </span>which states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“Sec. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Presumption of Fencing.</span> - Mere possession of
any goods, article, item, object or anything of value which has been the
subject of robbery or thievery shall be <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence of
fencing.<span style="">”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No matter <span style="">how </span>incriminating
the articles taken from the petitioner may be, their seizure cannot validate an
invalid warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span style="">in </span>the case of Mata v. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, G.R. No. 50720, <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1984</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">128</span> SCRA 388:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>that nothing can
justify the issuance of the search warrant but the fulfillment of the legal
requisites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might <span style="">be </span>well to
point out what has been said in Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. v.
Herrera:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘It has been said that of all the rights of a citizen, few are of
greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right
of personal security, and that involves the exemption of his private affairs,
books and papers from inspection and scrutiny of others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the power to search and seize is
necessary to the public welfare, still it must be exercised and the <span style="">law </span>enforced without transgressing
the constitutional rights of the citizens, for the enforcement of no statute is
of sufficient importance to <span style="">justify </span>indifference
to the basic principles of government.”</p>

<blockquote>“Thus, in issuing a search warrant the Judge must strictly comply
with the requirements of the Constitution and the statutory provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A liberal construction should be given in
favor of the individual to prevent stealthy encroachment upon, or gradual
depreciation of the rights secured by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No <span class="GramE">presumption of
regularity are</span> to be invoked in aid of the process when an officer
undertakes to justify <span style="">it.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the seized articles were described in the receipt issued
by <span style="">PC </span>Sergeant <span class="SpellE"><span style="">M</span><span style="">a</span><span style="">maril</span></span><span style=""> as </span>galvanized bolts, V-chuckle, U-bolts
and 3 1/2 feet angular bar (p. 21, Record).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no showing that the <span style="">possession
</span>thereof is prohibited by law hence, the return thereof to petitioner is
proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, <span style="">the </span>use in evidence <span style="">of </span>the
articles seized pursuant to an invalid search warrant is enjoined by Section
3(2), Article III of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment is hereby rendered: 1) declaring
