<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution is reproduced below:</p>

<blockquote>At about 10:30 o'clock in the evening of July 21, 1981, at the
market site in <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> arrived home, having just come from their
newly <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">contructed</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> house where he was earlier drinking with
Tony Castillo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told his son, Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, to prepare the flashlight and a gallon of water as
they would sleep in their new house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After checking that the flashlight batteries were weak, Ely told Arthur
to get four new </span>ones.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime, he (Ely) would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">just go to
accompany Tony Castillo home because the latter was already drunk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After around thirty minutes, Arthur followed
his father and proceeded to the house of Tony Castillo which was located near
the footbridge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nearing the place, or
from a distance of five (5) meters from where he stood, Arthur saw his father
being ganged up by <span class="SpellE">Ador</span> <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>,
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span> and Carling <span class="SpellE">Merano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because it was a moonlit night, Arthur
clearly saw <span class="SpellE">Ador</span> <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>
stab his father, while Carling <span class="SpellE">Merano</span> covered the
mouth and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span> held the hands of his
father at the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arthur shouted at
the assailants, "Please don't do that to my father." <span class="SpellE">Ador</span> <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span> then said to his
two companions, "Flee because I can tackle this." Jaime <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span> and Carling <span class="SpellE">Merano</span>
released Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> from their hold and chased Arthur
who immediately ran home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Upon
reaching their house, he awakened his mother, <span class="SpellE">Feligonia</span>,
from sleep and told her about the incident (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 6-12).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> left the house of
Tony Castillo, the latter's wife, <span class="SpellE">Osita</span>, went to the
kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she heard some shouting,
and then a shout for help (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="11">Nov. 12, 1984</st1:date>,
p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she opened the door she saw,
in front of the house of Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Cantillana</span> which
near the footbridge, Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> lying down while <span class="SpellE">Ador</span> <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span> was bending
towards the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> was asking for help so Castillo rushed and pulled
back <span class="SpellE">Ador</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> stood up, she saw that he was hit and she
heard him say, ‘Tama <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Ador</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> may tama <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">durha</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> hospital.’ When Castillo saw <span class="SpellE">Ador</span>
holding a bladed weapon, she got afraid and immediately went back to her
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After ten minutes she came out
again but Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> was no longer in the place where
she found him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Castillo decided to
inform Ely's wife about the incident, <span class="GramE">whose</span>, house was
about two hundred (200) meters away from her place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="10">Oct. 16, 1984</st1:date>,
pp. 5, 11-13, 18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When <span class="SpellE">Feligonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
was awakened and informed by her son Arthur about the attack made against her
husband Ely by <span class="SpellE">Ador</span> and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>
and Carling <span class="SpellE">Merano</span>, she at once changed her clothes
and went out to find out about the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As she went out of the house, <span class="SpellE">Osita</span> Castillo
arrived and informed her that her husband was brought to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Feligonia</span> proceeded
to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>hospital</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Dr.
  Chang</st1:placename></st1:place>, whereat upon arriving, she saw her husband
being brought outside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing her
husband, she immediately embraced him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When she asked him about what had happened, Ely told her that he was
stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Ador</span> (<span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>),
held by Jaime (<span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>) while his mouth was covered
by the hands of <span class="SpellE">Carlihg</span> (<span class="SpellE">Merano</span>)
(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Aug. 13, 1984, pp. 2-5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> was subsequently brought
to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where after a few minutes, he died (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <u>id</u>., pp. 6-7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The medico-legal certificate issued by the attending physician, Dr. Ruth
<span class="SpellE">Almanzor</span>, showed that Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
sustained the following injuries, thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote>’1<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Stab</span>

<blockquote>"According to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Almanzor</span>, wounds
nos. 2, 3 and 4 were fatal, and that Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> died
due to severe hemorrhage because of severe blood loss (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="8">Aug. 9, 1983</st1:date>, pp. 7, 9).<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">For his part, ADOR pleaded self-defense, describing the
circumstances thereof, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence for accused Amador <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>
indicate that on that particular time of the evening of July 21, 1981, while he
was sleeping in his house at Market Site, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, he was awakened by someone shouting outside who
turned out to be Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, the victim, ‘<span class="SpellE">Ador</span> go out and I will <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">kill you, if you will not go out I will go </span>inside and I will
kill you all’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After shouting these
words three or four times, Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> banged the door
of the house of Amador <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Masangkay</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> with a piece of wood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point Amador <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>
rose up from bed, </span>opened the door and went out of his house holding an
opened <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He found Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
just one meter away from him and the latter struck him twice with the piece of
wood which was 2" by 2" and a meter long.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He parried the first blow and was able to get
hold the piece of wood on the second blow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He then stabbed Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> who stepped
backward about three meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
followed and continued stabbing Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> until the
latter fell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then felt someone
holding him by his belt and when he turned he saw that it was <span class="SpellE">Osita</span> Castillo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
became afraid and ran away because he was '<span class="SpellE">nawala</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">sarili</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He finally reached <span class="SpellE">Mayngaran</span>

his brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Merano</span>,
he went to the P.C. Camp and surrendered to Col. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>.</blockquote>

had a misunderstanding about the latter's pigs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ely <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> tied his pigs in front of his dry
goods store in the market and this made his place dirty and attracted
flies."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused JAIME <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span> disclaimed any
participation in ganging up on the victim and offered alibi as his

wife were asleep in their house, which is near the place of the incident, at
the time when the victim was stabbed;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and that he came to know of said stabbing only when Atty. Oscar Amador, the
Municipal Attorney, with some companions, went to see him shortly before 12

in not appreciating bias in the testimony of Arthur and <span class="SpellE">Feligonia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verano</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Except for Errors II and IV, the other errors assigned revolve
around the issue of credibility of witnesses and are unmeritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like the Trial Court, we find no reason to
doubt the testimony of Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, an eyewitness
to the incident, who categorically testified that he saw the appellants ganging
up on his deceased father, with ADOR in the act of stabbing, CARLITO covering
his father's mouth and JAIME holding the victim's hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was only about five (5) meters distant
from them and could see clearly because it was then a moonlit night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And because he dared ask them to spare his
father's life, he was chased by JAIME and CARLITO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
did witness the brutal killing of his father is shown by the fact that about an
hour after the killing the police already set out looking for ADOR who was
nowhere to be found in the locality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Corroborating Arthur's testimony is that of <span class="SpellE">Osita</span>
Castillo, who lived across <span class="SpellE">ADOR's</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She heard a shout for help, rushed out, and
saw ADOR bending over the victim who was pleading that ADOR stop his
attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Osita</span>
pulled ADOR by the latter's belt only to see that the latter was holding a
bladed knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Osita's</span>
declaration that she pulled ADOR by the belt is corroborated by ADOR himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The revelation of the victim's wife that her husband had
disclosed to her the identity of the three assailants and the manner of their
respective participation as he was about to be transferred to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> does form part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE">g<u>estae</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was made within an hour after the stabbing
incident, a startling occurrence, respecting the circumstances thereof, when
the victim did not have time to contrive nor devise a falsehood.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is competent testimonial evidence to support the appellants' conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Feligonia</span>
failed to inform the authorities immediately regarding her husband's
declarations is understandable in view of the state of shock that she was
in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be stated, however, that
even without it, the testimonies of eyewitnesses Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Osita</span> Castillo suffice to sustain appellants'
guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no inconsistencies between the testimonies of Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Osita</span> Castillo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the defense posture, Arthur never
said that he was only informed by <span class="SpellE">Osita</span> of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What he testified to was that it was when
after having been chased by JAIME and CARLITO that <span class="SpellE">Osita</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Tia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cita</span> to him) told him
that she had also witnessed the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was not merely informed thereof by <span class="SpellE">Osita</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was an eyewitness himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relationship of mother and son (<span class="SpellE">Feligonia</span>
and Arthur, respectively) to the deceased would neither militate against the
credibility of their testimonies.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the Trial Court in giving no credence to <span class="SpellE">ADOR's</span> claim of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having admitted the killing, it was incumbent
upon said accused to prove it by clear and convincing evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This, ADOR has not only failed to do, but also, the number of the four (4) stab
wounds he had inflicted, their location on the chest, and their depth of
penetration constitute ample physical evidence <span class="SpellE">belieing</span>
self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the requisites of
self-defense are sorely absent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
alleged shouted threats and pounding on the door of <span class="SpellE">ADOR's</span>
house by the victim do not constitute unlawful aggression, the said accused
having been within the safe confines of his home without having been threatened
with an attack in an immediate and imminent manner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
And even assuming that there was unlawful aggression there was no reasonable
necessity of the means employed by ADOR to prevent or repel it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he had narrated, he had succeeded in
disarming the victim of the piece of wood the latter was allegedly carrying so
that stabbing with such frequency, frenzy and force can no longer be considered
as reasonably necessary.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">ADOR's</span> confession that he alone was
responsible for the killing was correctly ignored by the Trial Court in the
face of the positive declarations and identifications made by a credible
eyewitness, Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">ADOR's</span> attempt to
cover up for his brother and brother-in-law is only too obvious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact must be added that after committing the offense ADOR
fled from the scene of the crime and hid in the house of the grandmother of his
wife at <span class="SpellE">Mayngaran</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As oft-held, flight is considered as evidence tending to establish
guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> contention that he had voluntarily
surrendered is thus negated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defenses of alibi interposed by JAIME and CARLITO deserve no
credence either in the face of the clear and categorical identification by
eyewitness Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and in the absence of any
showing of the physical impossibility of their having been at the scene of the
crime at the time of its commission, their respective houses being near the
place of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the aspect of conspiracy, we affirm the Trial Court's
finding as to its existence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
conspiracy to be <span class="GramE">appreciated,</span> it is enough that at the
time the offense was committed, the participants had the same purpose and were
united in its execution, as may be inferred from the attendant circumstances.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The act of JAIME in holding the victim's hands and CARLITO in covering said
victim's mouth while ADOR hacked away, eloquently show community of criminal
purpose as well as taking advantage of their superior strength.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that JAIME and CARLITO were with the
Station Commander in trying to effect <span class="SpellE">ADOR's</span> arrest
does not negate conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither
would the fact that <span class="SpellE">Osita</span> Castillo saw only ADOR and
not JAIME and CARLITO because at the time she went out of her house, the latter
two had left to chase Arthur <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> and in obedience
to <span class="SpellE">ADOR's</span> behest that they flee since he could tackle
the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy having been
established, the act of one is the act of all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed is Murder, qualified by treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance of abuse of superior
strength, although appreciable, is inherent in treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No other modifying circumstance attended the
commission of the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the imposable
penalty should be <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> as
imposed by the Trial Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
with the abolition of capital punishment in the 1987 Constitution, the penalty
for Murder is now <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its maximum period to <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of any modifying circumstances, the penalty is imposable
in its minimum period, or <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its maximum
period, the range of which is seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1)
day to twenty (20) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">For purposes of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the range of the
penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the
offense, is <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> in its
maximum period to <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its medium period, or,
from (10) years and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby modified
in that each of the three accused shall suffer an indeterminate penalty of ten

as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u>
