Enrique Almario, former counsel of plaintiff-petitioner filed a Notice for Relief as counsel which was approved on September 22, 1986.<br><br></li><li> On December 15, 1986, the services of Atty.

A careful perusal of the records of the case shows that private respondents received a copy of the decision, dated June 30, 1986 on July 2, 1986. On July 7, 1986, or five (5) days later, respondents filed their "Urgent Motion To Set Aside the Order of Default on July 7, 1986, (instead of filing a Motion for Reconsideration or a Notice of Appeal) which was denied outright on the same day by the respondent court. The last day therefore for perfecting their appeal fell on July 17, 1986. That private respondents were fully aware of the fact that the decision had already became final and executory on July 17, 1986, was manifested by the fact of their filing on July 21, 1986 a Petition for Relief from Judgment, a remedy resorted to by party litigants under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, when an appeal is no longer available because the decision has already became final and executory. Thus the court may set aside its own judgment which had become final, when it can be sufficiently shown after due process that such judgment was entered against a party through fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence, by the filing by a party of a petition in such court and in the same cause praying that the judgment, order or proceeding be set aside (Sec. 2, Rule 30, Rules of Court). Said petition must be filed within sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the said judgment or Order but not more than six (6) months after such judgment was entered; and must be accompanied with affidavits showing the fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence relied upon, and the facts constituting the petitioner's good and substantial cause of action or defense, as the case may be (Sec. 3, Rule 38).<br><br>The Petition for Relief was definitely filed within the reglementary period but it was wanting in form and substance, as it lacked the required affidavit or affidavits of merit showing fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence. This fact is clearly confirmed by the respondent court in its Order (Annex "A") granting said petition, when it miserably tried to justify the same by invoking justice, fairness and trial on the merits instead on account of fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence. But even assuming that the Petition for Relief was sufficient in form and substance, the respondent Judge should have conducted the necessary hearing to determine the truth of the allegation contained in the petition as required by Sec. 6 of Rule 38 which reads:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 6. <i>Proceedings after the answer is filed.</i> - Once the answer is filed, or the time for its filing has expired, the court shall hear the petition and if after such hearing, the court finds that the allegations thereof are not true, the petition shall be dismissed; but if it finds said allegations to be true, it shall order the judgment, order or other proceeding complained of to be set aside, upon such terms as may be just, and thereafter the case shall stand as if the judgment, order or other proceeding set aside had never been issued or taken."</blockquote>The respondent Judge therefore committed an error in <i>motu proprio,</i> granting the Petition for Relief of private respondents and outrightly setting aside her decision and ordering plaintiff to turn over the proceeds of the sale at public auction of the levied upon property to the private respondents on the basis of said petition alone without the benefit of hearing as mandated by the Rules.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, finding the petition meritorious, We hereby GRANT the same, and declare the assailed Orders of respondent Judge, dated September 3, 1986 and January 22, 1987 as NULL and VOID.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Melencio-Herrera, (Chairperson), Padilla, Sarmiento,</i> and <i>Regalado, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Annex "A"<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Annex "B"</div>
