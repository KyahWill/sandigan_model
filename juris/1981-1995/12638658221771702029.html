<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version of the facts, as summarized by the
Solicitor-General, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On November 29, 1982, at around 7:00 o'clock in the evening,
a civilian informer came to the Narcotics Command Office in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
City and reported that a cigarette vendor by the name of 'Mama Rose' was
selling marijuana at the corner of 3rd Street and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Avenue in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City (TSN, pp. 4-5, 13, May 4,
1984; pp. 3-4, 11, April 9, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Captain Castillo instructed the informant to conduct a test buy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He gave to the informant two (2) five-peso
bills, noting first the serial numbers in his pocket note (TSN, pp. 5, 14-15,
May 4, 1984; p. 4, April 9, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
informer left and after thirty (30) minutes came back and gave to Captain
Castillo two (2) sticks of marijuana cigarettes (Exhibit 'C-2') which he bought
from appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Captain Castillo again
instructed the informer to make another test buy from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the suspect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>From his
wallet, Captain Castillo extracted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">another</span>
two (2) five-peso bills and before handing the same to the informer, recorded
the serial numbers in his pocket note (TSN, p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">p. </span>19-21, May 4, 1984).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">A </span>team composed of
Captain Castillo, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Tahil</span> <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span>,
CIC <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Santiago and Angel <span class="SpellE">Sudiacal</span>
left with the informer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The informer
proceeded to where appellant was selling cigarettes to conduct the next test
buy while the NARCOM agents waited at the Black and White Open Bar located at <st1:street><st1:address>7th
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(TSN, pp. 6-7, April 9, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bar
was about three (3) blocks away from the place where appellant was selling
cigarettes (TSN, pp. 19, 8, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
forty-five (45) minutes more or less, the informer arrived at the Black and
White Bar and again gave to Captain Castillo two (2) sticks of marijuana
(Exhibit 'C-1'; TSN, p. 23, May 4, 1984; p. 6, April 9, 1986).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The team then proceeded to the place where appellant was selling
cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After identifying themselves
as NARCOM agents, Capt. Castillo told appellant that she was being placed under
arrest for illegal peddling of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant was requested to take out the contents of her wallet (TSN, pp.
6-7, April 9, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The four marked
five-peso bills were found among her possessions and were confiscated after the
serial numbers were confirmed by Captain Castillo from his record (TSN, pp.
23-25, May 4, 1984).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The initial of Sgt.
<span class="SpellE">Tahil</span> <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span> was also found
from the confiscated five-peso bills (TSN, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">9, </span>April 9, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span> searched the stall of appellant and found twenty
(20) sticks of marijuana cigarettes in a trash can placed under the small table
where appellant displayed the wares she was selling (TSN, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">7, </span>April 9,
1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was thereafter brought
to the station (TSN, p. 23, May 4, 1984).</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the station, appellant executed a statement confessing to her
crimes which she swore to before Assistant City Fiscal Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabali</span>, Jr. (TSN, pp. 5-6, June 20, 1984; Exhibit ‘G’).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The marijuana sticks confiscated were sent to the Philippine
Constabulary Crime Laboratory (PCCL) for analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These were confirmed to be marijuana as
evidenced by the Chemistry Report No. <span class="GramE">MD-363-82 of Marlene <span class="SpellE">Salangad</span>, a Forensic Chemist of the PCCL (See Exhibit 'B';
TSN, p. 3, Jan. 13, 1986)."</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
92-94)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the version of the appellant as summarized by
the trial <span class="GramE">court,</span> is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx [O]n November 29, 1982, between
9:00 and 10:00 o'clock in the evening she was at the corner of 3rd St., and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, West <span class="SpellE">Tapinac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City, selling cigarettes and fruits; that she does
not have any table, all she had was a small wooden '<span class="SpellE">papag</span>'
to show her wares and sell them; that she was sitting on the small '<span class="SpellE">papag</span>' when Capt. Castillo came and introduced himself
followed by three or four others who were more <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">or </span>less 6 to 8 meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was surprised why they were there, and that she was invited by Capt.
Castillo to the NARCOM office for investigation to which invitation she said
'yes' after which she was taken to the NARCOM office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before she was taken thereto, the other men
searched the <span class="SpellE">buri</span> bags where she used to place her
fruits (records does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">(sic) </span>not show what fruits she was selling) and also her small
cigarettes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(sic) </span>stand; that they
did not find anything under the '<span class="SpellE">papag</span>'; that when
she was ordered to board the car, Castillo told her '<span class="SpellE">sakay</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> ho, Mama Rose' (please board now, Mama Rose');
that she was told to bring along her cigarette stand; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that </span>inside her brown wallet, she has fifty (P50.00) pesos
consisting of five pesos and ten pesos; that it was <span class="SpellE">Sudiacal</span>
who took her wallet and <span class="SpellE">Sudiacal</span> took five (5) peso
bills and told her that four (4) five peso bills are the same money which was
used to buy marijuana from her; that she told the officer that the money was
hers as she has been saving some for the rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She claimed that she affixed her signatures
on the four (4) five peso bills because she was forced by <span class="SpellE">Tahil</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span> by saying 'Mama Rose', you sign this, if you
are not going to sign this, something will happen to you, you will get hurt’;
that because she is an old woman, she got scared so she signed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Tahil</span> <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span> told her to sign, <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span>
was talking to her in a normal manner and seated in front of her; that she
cannot remember having signed anything because she was nervous, Capt. Castillo
investigated her and thereafter was brought to the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She signed a document at the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office; that she was asked if the <span class="GramE">contents of the document is</span> (sic) true to which she answered
'No, sir'; that she was not assisted by a counsel while being
investigated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also testified that
she stayed at <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> for five (5) days; that Capt.
Castillo alone investigated her for four (4) hours and that she likewise was
not assisted by counsel at the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She claimed that when she was told by the
Fiscal to just sign the document, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Cabali</span> did
not say anything when she said that the contents of the document are not
true." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 72)</blockquote>

the crime of selling them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. de

<p class="BODY">This Court finds that such recital of rights falls short of the
requirement on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pr</span>oper <span class="SpellE">apprisal</span> of constitutional rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We quote the ruling in People v. <span class="SpellE">Nicandro</span> (141 SCRA 289 [1986]):</p>

<blockquote>"When the Constitution requires <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">a </span>person under investigation 'to be informed' of his right to
remain silent and to counsel, it must be presumed to contemplate the
transmission of meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and
perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>rule,
therefore, it would not be sufficient for a police officer just to repeat to
the person under investigation the provisions of Section 20, Article IV of the
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is not only duty-bound
to tell the person the rights to which the latter is entitled; he must also
explain their effects in practical terms, e.g., what the person under
interrogation may or may not do, and in a language the subject fairly
understands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the right
of a person under interrogation ‘to be informed’ implies a correlative
obligation on the part of the police investigator to explain, and contemplates
an effective communication that results in understanding what is conveyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Short of this, there is a denial of the
right, as it cannot truly be said that the person has been 'informed' of his
rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, since the right 'to be
informed' implies comprehension, the degree of explanation required will
necessarily vary, depending upon the education, intelligence and other relevant
personal circumstances of the person under investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that a simpler and more
lucid explanation is needed where the subject is unlettered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although the right to counsel is a right that may be waived, such
waiver must be voluntary, knowing and intelligent (People v. <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>, 95 SCRA 2 [1980]).</p>

<p class="BODY">To insure that a waiver is voluntary and intelligent, the
Constitution now requires that for the right to counsel to be waived, the
waiver must be in writing and in the presence of the counsel of the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Art. III, Section 12(1),
Constitution) There is no such written <u>waiver</u> in this case, much less
was any waiver made in the presence of counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Cabali</span>, who administered the
oath on the appellant's extrajudicial confession, and the police officers who
took it <span class="GramE">down</span> should know by now that the procedure

<p class="BODY">Second,<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the alleged poseur
buyer, who also happens to be the alleged informant, was never presented during
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presence and identity of the
poseur-buyer is vital to the case as his very existence is being disputed by
the accused-appellant who denies having sold marijuana cigarettes to
anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 50
[1986]) Without the testimony of the poseur-buyer, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>no convincing evidence pointing to
the accused as having sold marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. Fernando, 145 SCRA 151 [1986]) In this case, the alleged
informant and the alleged poseur-buyer are one and the same person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We realize that narcotics agents often have
to keep their identities and those of their informants confidential.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For a prosecution involving the sale or
distribution of drugs to prosper in this particular case, however, the informant
has to testify.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the poseur-buyer is rendered compelling by the
fact that the police officers were situated three blocks away from where the
alleged sale took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They did not
see the actual sale of mari<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">j</span>uana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sudiacal</span>

<p class="BODY">It is a known fact that drug dealings are hard to prove in
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Precisely because of this
difficulty, buy-bust operations have to be conducted and every effort is taken
such that the suspected pusher is caught in <span class="SpellE">flagrante</span>
selling prohibited drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the
culprit to be convicted, the element of sale must be unequivocally
established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the alleged
poseur-buyer who could have categorically asserted that she bought marijuana
from the appellant was not presented by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sudiacal</span> could not
attest to the fact of sale because they were three blocks away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sale of marijuana was therefore not
positively <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">proven.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the absence of the testimony of the poseur-buyer, the
court a quo, however, relied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>circumstantial
evidence in concluding that there was indeed a sale:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"In </span>this case,
the accused admitted that she was the only one selling cigarettes at the corner
of <st1:street><st1:address>3rd Street</st1:address></st1:street>; the
informant told the NARCOM Officers that their 'suspect' is a cigarette vendor
positioned thereat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two (2) ‘test
buy’ yielded positive results as the informant was able to buy four (4) <span class="SpellE">handrolled</span> sticks of marijuana cigarettes from her, two at
a time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused did not ask the
reason why when she was invited for investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This act negates innocence and against human
nature, especially after having introduced themselves as NARCOM agents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her control and possession, twenty (20)
sticks of similar <span class="SpellE">handrolled</span> marijuana cigarettes
were recovered from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>trash can
under her small table.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her counsel on
cross-examination asked Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Tahil</span> <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span> the following (TSN, April 9, 1986, p. 14) ‘and in
order to search that trash can under the table, you have to ask or request
‘Mama Rose’ to get out of the way in order to check the contents of the waste
can?’ The question was answered, 'We asked permission from her to stand up so
we can look into the contents of her small table, sir.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When investigated, the accused gave her statement which in
fact was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>confession where she
admitted having sold marijuana cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was taken before the Fiscal to subscribe the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While she alleged that she told the Fiscal<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>(Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Cabali</span>)
that the contents of her statement are not true, why then did she sign it
before the said Fiscal?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>did she not insist that her denial be
registered on the document so as to repudiate it?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fear could not be a valid reason as she has
already boldly spoken out when she said the contents were not true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 'marked money' were recovered from her possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not deny that the four (4) five peso
bills were taken from her wallet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was addressed as 'Mama Rose' not once but twice by the apprehending officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her counsel during the cross-examination of
the prosecution witnesses and direct examination of the accused called and
addressed her as ‘Mama Rose', and the informant identified her not only as
Rosalinda Ramos but also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>'Mama
Rose'." (At pp. 73<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">-</span>74, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds that the cited circumstantial evidence do not
establish beyond reasonable doubt that there was a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">sale </span>of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the severe penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>
imposed on those who sell or distribute drugs, we have to insure that evidence
of culpability must pass the test of the strictest scrutiny.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We also have to take into account the
oft-repeated defense in violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act that the drugs or
the marked money were planted by police officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More direct and positive evidence is
essential.</p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the appellant to ask why she was being invited for
investigation by the NARCOM officers does not ipso facto indicate her
guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fear could have prevented her
from propounding inquiries to the officers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Nor </span>does the fact
that marked money was found in her possession show incontrovertibly that she is
the seller of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
is a cigarette vendor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the nature of
her job, there is a constant exchange of goods for money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be far-fetched but it is possible that
she came into possession of the marked money because she accepted it in the
course of legitimate sales of cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again, it is only the poseur-buyer who could testify that she gave
marked money to the appellant in exchange for marijuana sticks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the appellant signed the extrajudicial confession
despite her insistence that its contents were not true does not necessarily
signify guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated the
extra-judicial confession cannot be accepted as evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is useless for purposes of proof of sale
of prohibited drugs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, this Court fails to see how, from her being addressed as
Mama Rose by the witnesses and appellant's counsel and the alleged
informant-poseur buyer, the sale of marijuana can be inferred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 133, Section 5 of the Rules of Court provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if:</p>

<p class="BODY">(a) There is more than one circumstance;</p>

<p class="BODY">(b) The facts from which the inference are derived are proven;
and</p>

<p class="BODY">(c) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to
produce a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">For not successfully meeting the above requirements, the
enumerated circumstantial evidence cannot be a ground <span class="GramE">for</span>
conviction for the sale of marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Criminal Case No. 5990, however, this Court
upholds the lower court's finding that the appellant is guilty of possession of
marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 113 Section 6 (b) of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 6.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Arrest without warrant.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- <span class="GramE">when</span> lawful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- A peace officer or a private person may,

fact just been committed, and he has personal knowledge of facts indicating

</span>- Search incident to a lawful arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>-<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A person lawfully arrested may
be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the
commission of an offense, without a search warrant.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Sudiacal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ahamad</span> testified that there was an informant who
apprised them of the presence of a drug pusher at the corner of <st1:street><st1:address>3rd
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> and <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting on such information and in their
presence, their superior, Captain Castillo, gave the informant marked money to
buy marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The informant, now turned
poseur buyer, returned with two sticks of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Captain Castillo again gave said informant
marked money to purchase marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
informant-poseur buyer thereafter returned with another two sticks of
marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police officers then proceeded
to the corner of <st1:street><st1:address>3rd Street</st1:address></st1:street>
and <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>
and <span class="GramE">effected</span> the arrest of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above facts, it may be concluded that the arresting
police officers had personal knowledge of facts implicating the appellant with
the sale of marijuana to the informant-poseur buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold therefore that the arrest was legal
and the consequent search which yielded 20 sticks of marijuana was lawful for
being incident to a valid arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the prosecution failed to prove the sale of
marijuana beyond reasonable doubt does not undermine the legality of the
appellant's arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not necessary that the crime should have been established
as a fact in order to regard the detention as legal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legality of detention does not depend
upon the actual commission of the crime, but upon the nature of the deed when
such characterization may reasonably be inferred by the officer or functionary
to whom the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">law at </span>the moment
leaves the decision for the urgent purpose of suspending the liberty of the
citizen (People v. <span class="SpellE">Molleda</span>, 86 SCRA 667 [1978]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The obligation to make an arrest by reason of a crime does not
presuppose as a necessary requisite for the fulfillment thereof the indubitable
existence of a crime (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>, 68 Phil. 415
[1939]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant argues that if the twenty sticks of marijuana were
in a trash can and it was not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
said trash can belongs to the appellant, <span class="GramE">then</span> she
cannot be considered as being in possession of marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">In disposing of this contention, this Court quotes with approval
the following arguments of the Solicitor-General:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant's defense falls against the categorical testimony
of the NARCOM agents that the trash can was found under the table where her
legitimate wares were being sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
fact was not denied by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, she was the only person who had access to the trash can.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same was under her immediate physical
control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had complete charge of the
contents of the trash can under the table to the exclusion of all other
persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">law, </span>actual possession exists when the thing is in the immediate
occupancy and control of the party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
this is not to say that the law requires actual possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In criminal law, possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">necessary </span>for conviction of the
offense of possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute may be
constructive as well as actual (Black's Law Dictionary Abridge, 5th Edition,
pp. 606-607).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only necessary that
the defendant must have dominion and control over the contraband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These requirements are present in the
situation described, where the prohibited drugs were found inside the trash can
<span class="GramE">placed</span> under the stall owned by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the NARCOM agents who conducted the
search testified that they had to ask appellant to stand so that they could
look inside the trash can under the '<span class="SpellE">papag</span>' of the
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the trash can was
positioned in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">such a way </span>that it
was difficult for another person to use the trash can.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trash can was obviously not for use by
her customers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant's arguments are inherently weak <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and </span>improbable and cannot stand against
the clear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">evidence </span>pointing to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">her actual possession of the prohibited
drug.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The raw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">facts testified to</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">by the NARCOM agents were corroborated </span>by
appellant and their conclusion - that she had possession of the marijuana
sticks <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">found </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the trash can - is consistent with law and
reason.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant further contends that it is hard to believe that
she would keep the marijuana sticks in a trash can since it is a precious
commodity to pushers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span>users
thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above argument <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>misleading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The value of the marijuana is not the primary
consideration in the concealment of the contraband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary consideration is escaping
detection and arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the
modus operandi was to dissimulate the act of selling and possession of
marijuana sticks which carries the capital penalty (sic).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant could not display it among her
regular wares of cigarettes and fruits for sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had to hide them from public view, but
near enough to have access to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
trash can, to her thinking, would be the last place to look for the precious
commodity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, she was found
out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The argument that it was an
'unlikely place' to hide the precious contraband is in fact the very
consideration in choosing it as the hiding place for the contraband." (At
pp. 97-100, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We
</span>rule, therefore, that the twenty sticks of marijuana are admissible in evidence
and the trial court's finding that the appellant is guilty of possession is
correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, however, erred in imposing a fixed penalty of
six (6) years and one (1) day for possession of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law
(Republic Act 4103 as amended) provides that in imposing a prison sentence for
an offense punished by a law other than the Revised Penal Code, the court shall
sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which
shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum which shall not
be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The penalty prescribed by the Dangerous Drugs
Act for possession of marijuana is imprisonment ranging from six (6) years and
one (1) day to twelve (12) years and a fine ranging from P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>
