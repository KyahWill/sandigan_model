				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> to annul and
set aside the decision of the then Intermediate Appellate Court dated February
27, 1986<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
affirming the decision of the then Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija,
Fourth Judicial District, Branch VII in Civil Case No. 6244 dated November 25,
1981<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in ordering petitioners to pay private respondents damages, attorney’s fees and
the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears on record that private respondents Andres Ventura,
Antonio Fajardo, Marcelo Fajardo, Alfonso Ventura and Florentino Ventura are leasehold
tenants of a parcel of land consisting of about five (5) hectares of riceland
situated at Sitio Dagat-dagatan, Sto. Rosario, Sta. Rosa, Nueva Ecija.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1967, petitioner National Irrigation Administration
(NIA for brevity) constructed an irrigation canal on the property of Isabel and
Virginia Tecson which passed through the private respondents’ landholdings as
said irrigation canal traverses the Cinco-Cinco Creek which abuts said
landholding.  The irrigation canal has
two (2) outlets which provide private respondents’ landholdings with water
coming from said canal and at the same time serve to drain the excess water of
said landholdings.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 13, 1975, private respondents filed a complaint for
the abatement of nuisance with damages against petitioners NIA and/or the
Administrator of the National Irrigation Administration alleging that the two
(2) outlets constructed on both sides of the irrigation canal were not provided
with gates to regulate the flow of water from the canal to their landholdings
which resulted to the inundation of said landholdings <span style="">causing </span>the former to sustain damages consisting in the
destruction <span style="">of </span>the planted palay
crops and also prevented them from planting on their landholdings.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, a decision was rendered by the court
below on November 25, 1981, the pertinent portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“</span>In
view of the foregoing, the Court finds the complaint meritorious.  However, since there were typhoons and plant
pests that reduced the harvests of the plaintiffs and that there were benefits
that accrued to the plaintiffs by reason of said irrigation canal, the civil
liability of the defendant should naturally be reduced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, judgement is hereby entered:  1) Ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of
P35,000.00 representing damages; 2) Ordering defendant to pay P5,000.00 for
attorney’s fees and the cost of the suit.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with said decision, petitioners elevated the matter
to the appellate court which rendered a decision on February 27, 1986 affirming
<i>in toto</i> the decision of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.  It
is petitioners’ position that the respondent appellate court erred in affirming
the decision of the trial court because NIA is immune from suit for quasi-delict
or tort and assuming NIA could be sued, it is not liable for tort since it did
not act through a special agent as required under paragraph 6, Article 2180 of
the <span style="">Civil </span>Code of the
Philippines.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners are in error.  As correctly ruled by the court below, the NIA “is not immune from suit,
by virtue of the express provision of P.D. No. 552.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A reading of Section 2, sub-paragraph (f) of P.D. No. 552,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
amending Republic Act No. 3601 shows the granting to NIA the power “to exercise
all the powers of a corporation under the Corporation Law, insofar as they are
not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.” Paragraph 4 of said law also
provide that petitioner NIA may sue and be sued in court for all kind of
actions, whether contractual or quasi-contractual, in the recovery of
compensation and damages as in the instant case considering that private
respondents’ action is based on damages caused by the negligence of
petitioners.  This Court had previously
held that “the National Irrigation Administration is a government agency with a
juridical personality separate and distinct from the government.  It is not a mere agency of the government
but a corporate body performing proprietary functions”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> as it
has its own assets and <span style="">liabilities </span>as
well as its own corporate powers to be exercised <span style="">by a </span>Board of Directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 6, Article 2180 of the Civil Code of the Philippines
states that:</p>

<blockquote>“The State is responsible in like manner when it acts through a
special agent; but not when the damage has been caused by the official to whom
the task done properly pertains, in which case what is provided in article 2176
shall be applicable.”<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 2176 of <span style="">said </span>Code
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>“Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being
fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done.  Such fault or negligence, if there is no
pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict
and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.”<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioners are liable for the damages caused <span style="">by </span>their negligent act.  Said the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>“On the issue of negligence, plaintiffs through the testimonies of
Andres Ventura, Florentino Ventura and Prudencio Martin showed that the NIA
constructed irrigation canals on the landholding[s] of the plaintiffs by
scrapping away the surface of the landholding[s] to raise the embankment <span style="">of </span>the canal.  As a result of the said <span style="">construction, in </span>1967 the landholdings
of the plaintiffs were inundated with water.  Although it cannot be denied that the irrigation canal of the NIA is a
boon to the plaintiffs, the delay of almost 7 years in installing the safety
measures such as check gates, drainage[s], ditches and paddy drains has caused
substantial damage to the annual harvest of the plaintiffs.  In fact, Engineer Garlitos, witness for the
defendant declared that these improvements were made only after the settlement
of the claim of Mrs. Virginia Tecson, which was sometime in 1976 or 1977, while
the irrigation canal was constructed in 1976 [1967].  The testimonies of the plaintiffs essentially corroborated by a
disinterested witness in the person of Barangay Captain Prudencio <span style="">Martin, </span>proved that the landholdings
of the complainants were inundated when the NIA irrigation canal was
constructed without safety devises thereby reducing their annual harvest of 30
cavans per hectare (portions flooded).  The failure [,] therefore, of the NIA to provide the necessary
safeguards to prevent the inundation of plaintiffs’ landholding[s] is the
proximate cause of the damages to the poor farmers.  On the other hand, the defendant maintains that the cause of
inundation of plaintiffs’ landholdings was the check gate of the Cinco-cinco
creek known as Tombo check gate.  However, evidence showed that this check gate existed long before the
NIA irrigation canal was constructed and there were no complaints from the
plaintiffs until the canal of the NIA was built.  The uncontested testimony of barrio captain Prudencio Martin that
the former name of the sitio where the plaintiffs’ landholdings were located
was “Hilerang Duhat” but was changed to Sitio Dagat-dagatan because of the
inundation was not without justification.”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With regard to petitioners’ contention that the respondent
appellate court erred in awarding damages to private respondents, We find said
court’s decision in accordance with the evidence and the law.  As correctly held by the appellate court:</p>

<blockquote>“It has been established that the plaintiffs’ landholdings were
actually inundated.  The testimonies by
all the plaintiffs with respect to the amount of the loss they suffered were
not impugned by any contradictory evidence of the defendant.  To Our mind, these testimonies are
sufficient proof to make the grant of damages valid and proper.  Besides, the amount awarded by the lower court
is but just and reasonable considering the circumstances of the case.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
