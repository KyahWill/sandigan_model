San Agustin, <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>, Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about 6:00 o'clock that afternoon, some

</span>Later, while she and her children were eating supper, she again saw said

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 o'clock</st1:time>
that evening, her husband, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Camacho, arrived,
and since he was very tired, went directly to bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later that night, while the family was
asleep, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> was roused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">from </span>her sleep when her husband stood up and went out of the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, she heard a
commotion and the cry of her husband saying that he was hit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
stood up, got her flashlight and went out of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she beamed her flashlight, she saw
appellant Juan <span class="SpellE">Espera</span> holding a piece of wood about
thirty-six (36) inches long, <span class="SpellE">Atilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> carrying a bolo around eight (8) inches <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>length and called <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>"<span class="SpellE">depang</span>,"
and appellant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tolitol</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the three were illumined and revealed by
the light coming from the flashlight, they ran toward the kitchen and
fled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she saw her husband
leaning against the door of their store with his face towards the wall and his
mouth profusely bleeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
immediately called her children to summon help from an uncle who lived nearby
but it was her brother who subsequently brought <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
to the hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that same evening, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
discovered that the amount of two hundred thirty-four pesos (P234.00)
representing the store's earnings that day was no longer in the drawer of a
table near the shelves of the store and her Seiko watch worth five hundred
fifty pesos (P550.00) which was kept in the same drawer was missing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also found out that the three, Juan, <span class="SpellE">Atilo</span> and Francisco, were able to enter the house through
the window shutter which had been destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> immediately reported the incident to
the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> who made an ocular
inspection that very evening.</p>

<p class="BODY">Four days thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> died in<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the hospital, the cause of his death being
severe <span class="SpellE">cranio</span>?cerebral injury secondary to

 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> and who performed the
post-mortem examination, testified that the victim suffered five (5)
wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Testifying on the medico-legal
certificate on the wounds of the victim which are numerically referred to
herein for facility, she explained that the first wound could have been
inflicted by a hard object, such as a piece of wood:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the second wound, by a hard object or a
fistic blow; the third wound, with the use of a sharp-bladed instrument; and
the fourth and fifth wounds could likewise have been inflicted by a hard
object.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The most serious injuries,
according to her, were the first, second, fourth and fifth wounds because they
were fractures which involved the brain.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused denied any participation in the commission of the
offense and interposed the defense of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant Juan <span class="SpellE">Espera</span> alleged that he was at
the house of one Mariano <span class="SpellE">Gularez</span> when the crime took
place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gularez</span>
was then having a party to celebrate the birth of his son and <span class="SpellE">Espera</span> was hired to cook the "<span class="SpellE">lechon</span>"
or roast pig and to thereafter serve as kitchen helper and dishwasher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he did not go home that whole
evening and slept at <span class="SpellE">Gularez</span>’ house until the
following day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This alibi was
substantially corroborated by Mariano <span class="SpellE">Gularez</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other appellant, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tolitol</span>, also alleged that on the same evening he came home
from the field very tired and slept very early, at about 7:00 o'clock in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>He was then sleeping at the house of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> for whom he worked as a hired hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">go </span>out of
the house until the next day when he woke <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">up

<p class="BODY">We have scrupulously reviewed the records and calibrated the
evidence of the parties, and We find no reason to reject the testimony of
prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> Camacho.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That she is the widow of the deceased victim
does not on that score alone affect her credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an established and conceded rule that
the mere fact that the witness is a relative of a victim is not a valid or
sufficient ground to disregard the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> testimony
nor does it render the same less worthy of credit, in the absence of any
ill-motive.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The utter failure of the appellants in this case to show any evil reason or
motive on the part of the witness that could have made her testify as she did
and to implicate them in such a serious crime as robbery with homicide makes
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> Camacho all the more worthy
of full faith and credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is,
thus, nothing in the record which would contradict this observation of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Witness
<span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> Camacho indeed testified serenely and with
composure which the Court observed keenly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her testimony was natural and flawless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The court gives full credence to her testimony."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, We cite the well-settled rule that the findings of
the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are respected by the appellate
courts, the former having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their
deportment and manner of testifying, unless it has plainly overlooked certain
facts of substance and value which, if considered, might affect the result of
the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We are not persuaded by appellants' arguments that their case falls under the
exception, hence the Court finds no reason to disturb the findings of facts of
the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is also no basis to doubt the positive identification of
the appellants by <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> Camacho.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The beam of light from her flashlight was
sufficient to enable her to see and readily recognize the three intruders,
especially because they were her neighbors of relatively long standing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, one of the appellants, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tolitol</span>, worked for the Camacho spouses as an errand boy
for some time and even slept in their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no call either for the defense to denigrate the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> Camacho that she saw and recognized the weapons
held by <span class="SpellE">Espera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span>,
that is, a piece of wood and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>short bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Physical
evidence, reflected by the medical findings, confirm that the wounds sustained
by the victim could definitely have been inflicted by the said weapons seen and
testified to by <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being an absence of any motive on her
part to prevaricate, it would be unnatural for said witness, as the wife of the
deceased victim and who is necessarily interested in seeing retribution exacted
for the crime, to impute the same to any person other than those responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the charge of robbery, however, there is warrant
for an honest difference of opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While, as earlier stated, <span class="SpellE">Teresita's</span> testimony
is deserving of credit, her declaration thereon was limited to the fact that,
after having gone to the hospital and on her return <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
she discovered the loss of the money and the watch alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the
information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No conclusive evidence
proving <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>physical act of <span class="SpellE">asportation</span> thereof by the accused themselves has been
presented by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, under similar facts wherein the complainant
arrived home a few hours after his family was killed by the accused and he
found the money and jewelry missing, this Court declared:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"In the absence of any other known
motive for the crime it would be, in our judgment, to reject the universal
teaching of experience to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">refuse </span>to
draw the inference that the same person who killed the occupants of the house
also committed the robbery."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In said case, however, the stolen items were recovered from a third person who
implicated the accused therein as the author of the crime and the latter
supposedly confessed, although the competence and weight of such evidence would
now be of dubious validity and value under the present rules of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, as cited by the defense, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

robbery charged as the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">constituent </span>element
of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide has to be entirely
disregarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, in <u>People</u>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Moro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Ambahang</u></span> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court also held that the testimony of the witness that he found his personal
belongings gone when he returned to the scene of the killing, but he did not
see who stole said things, the crime of robbery cannot be imputed to the
accused since it is not based on substantial evidence but on mere presumptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the same effect, as noted by <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Mr. </span>Justice Padilla, is the doctrine in <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacala</u></span><u>,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held that absent conclusive evidence that robbery has actually
taken place, there can be no conviction for the composite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">crime </span>of robbery with homicide, but
only for homicide which was duly proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While this holding has been criticized as inaccurate.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
We are persuaded to hold it as an applicable determinant for our present
purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It observes fidelity to the
fundamental rule that criminal law should yield any reasonable doubt in favor
of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At least in the factual
milieu of the present case, the acceptance of the foregoing doctrines would not
constitute an exacting onus on the criminal justice system and the law
enforcement agencies by seemingly demanding that there be an eyewitness to
prove the actual <span class="SpellE"><u>apoderamiento</u></span> in crimes like
robbery or theft.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, further to what
has already been said, in the case at bar there is a paucity of evidence
showing that, other than the accused, no other person had or could have had
access to the premises where the money and the watch were allegedly kept,
either before or after the killing of the victim and until the loss was
supposedly discovered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The possibility
that there could have been other intruders enhances the element of doubt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>favor of
appellants on this score.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of appellants is alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been interminably repeated that this
defense can not prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the
prosecution's witness who has no motive to testify falsely against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To make alibi worthy of credit, the accused
must show that he was at some other place for such a period of time that it was
impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was committed at
the time of its commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
This is not so in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
places where appellants claimed to have been at the time of the incident and
the place of the crime are located within the same barrio and not far from the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, as found by the trial court, appellant <span class="SpellE">Tolitol</span>
was supposed to be in the house of <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> which is just across the street from the Camacho
residence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, however, erred in holding that the killing of
the victim was attended by treachery and evident premeditation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For treachery to be appreciated, it is
necessary to prove that, at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a
position to defend himself and that the offender consciously and deliberately
adopted the particular means, method or form of attack employed by him to
ensure the accomplishment of his purpose with impunity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of evidence to show the means
employed by the assailants and the mode of attack negates the imputed
circumstance of treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Treachery may
not be simply deduced from presumptions; it must be as clearly proven as the
crime itself in order to aggravate the liability of the culprit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither may evident premeditation be considered against
appellants, in the absence of proof that they had a prior plan to kill the
victim, when that plan was agreed upon and the interval of time between such
agreement and its commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the trial court also erred in not considering dwelling <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as an </span>aggravating circumstance.</p>

</span>first, that there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged robbery:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and second, that none of the things allegedly
stolen, namely, the transistor radio and the trunk purportedly containing the
sum of P1,700.00 was ever recovered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
there was, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">therefore, any evidence to
support the charge of robbery, </span>the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacsal</span>
testified that the five accused surrounded the hut, and after <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> fired his pistol, he and his father jumped from the
hut into the ground and ran to a place about sixty meters away where his father
was overtaken and attacked by said accused, and, afterwards, the latter left
and proceeded towards the direction of the hut.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Roque</span> then went to the succor of his father
and tried to assist him until <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

12.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is evident from the foregoing that no iota <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>evidence had been presented showing
that appellants and their companions knew of the existence of the money <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,700.00</span>,
or of the place where it was allegedly kept, much less is there any positive
proof that when they went to the place of the victim their intention was to rob
the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would seem, therefore,
that the trial court's conclusion that it has been ‘established beyond
peradventure of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">doubt that, taking
advantage of the night, five men decided to rob </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">deceased whom they </span>knew to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">have some money in the trunk . . . . .’ is
based on a mere inference, or conjecture and not upon positive evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>It is well-settled that </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

robbery itself be proven as conclusively as any other essential element of a
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for the crime of robbery
with homicide to exist</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, it
is necessary that it be clearly established that a robbery has actually taken
place, and that, </span>as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">consequence
or on the occasion </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">such
robbery, a homicide be committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Where

<p class="BODY">Additionally, it should be stated that penal laws are strictly
construed against the Government and liberally <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
