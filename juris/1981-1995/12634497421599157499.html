Compensation Commission dated 30 January 1976 dismissing their appeal in RO4-WC
Case No. 168534 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Villasan</span>, et al. vs. Republic of the Philippines
(Department of Health)," as well as of the Order dated 15 July 1977 of the
Compensation Appeals and Review Staff of the Department of Labor denying
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneously, they
pray that this case be considered a special civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deceased <span class="SpellE">Apolinar</span> <span class="SpellE">Villasan</span>, husband of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villasan</span>, was employed with the Malaria Eradication
Service of the Department of Health as Epidemiological Aide assigned with the
Malaria Unit at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, from August 1961 to <st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="7">3 July 1974</st1:date>, or a period of 13 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="7">6 July 1974</st1:date>,
he was admitted at the <st1:place><st1:placename>PSGMR</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he died of "irreversible shock secondary to severe hemorrhage and
bleeding peptic ulcer" on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="7">8 July
 1974</st1:date>, or two days after admission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="8">29 August 1974</st1:date>,
his wife and children, petitioners herein, as claimants, filed a Notice and
Claim for Compensation for his death, with Region IV-Workmen's Compensation
Section of the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">11 September 1974</st1:date>,
respondent employer filed its Employer's Report of Accident and Sickness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the Memorandum dated <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="11">15 November 1974</st1:date> of the Committee on Physical Examination
of the Department of Health, which found that there was no relationship between
the nature of the deceased's work as epidemiological aide and the cause of his
death, the Secretary of Health recommended to the Solicitor General that the
claim be <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Solicitor General registered
the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> on the ground that the claim is not
compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 October 1975, the Acting Referee, Regional Office No. 4,
Department of Labor, adopting the report of the physician who attended the
deceased to the effect that the illness which caused the death of <span class="SpellE">Apolinar</span> <span class="SpellE">Villasan</span> was "not
due to or in pursuance of, not a result of and not aggravated by his employment
as epidemiological aide of respondent," dismissed the case for want of
substantial evidence and for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time, petitioners did not have the benefit of counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners received copy of the dismissal Order on <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="12">18 December 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the assistance of counsel this time,
they filed a Motion for extension within which to move for reconsideration on
29 December 1975, but this was denied on 7 January 1976 by the Regional Office
on the ground that Department Order No. 3, Series of 1974, issued by the
Secretary of Labor, does not allow Motions for extension of time to file an
appeal from decisions or orders in Workmen's Compensation cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed a second Motion for extension on <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="1">12 January 1976</st1:date> followed by the
Motion for Reconsideration on <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="1">22
 January 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">30 January 1976</st1:date>,
the Workmen's Compensation Commission rendered a Decision considering the Order
of dismissal by the Acting Referee, dated <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="10">22 October 1975</st1:date>, final and the case closed for failure of
petitioners to perfect an appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, hence, the Commission could not have acquired jurisdiction over the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners moved for reconsideration on <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="3">5 March 1976</st1:date> on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Department Order No. 3, Series of 1974 is
not mandatory and the Motion for extension of time is addressed to the sound
discretion of the Commission;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is in the interest of sound administration
of justice that cases are decided on the merits and not on mere technicality;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doubt should be resolved in favor of labor;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim is meritorious as the illness which
resulted in the death of the deceased arose out of and in the course of
employment." (Annex "N").</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration was denied by the Compensation Appeals and Review
Staff of the Department of Labor on <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="7">15
 July 1977</st1:date> for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior permission of this Court to prosecute their case as paupers
having been obtained, petitioners instituted this Petition with us on <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="11">4 November 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gave due course to the Petition on <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="8">23 August 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="10">30 October 1978</st1:date>, petitioners
submitted a Motion praying additionally for reimbursement of medical and
funeral expenses in the sums of P77.43 and P750.00, respectively.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the deceased contracted his ailment during
his employment as epidemiological aide of respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, petitioners have in their favor
the disputable presumption that when the illness supervenes during employment,
it is to be presumed that the sickness either arose out of, or was at least
aggravated by the nature or conditions of his work and is compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
With this presumption, the burden of proof shifts to the employer and the
employee is relieved of the burden to show causation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The burden to overthrow the presumption and to disconnect, by
substantial evidence, <span style="">the </span>injury
or sickness <span style="">from </span>employment, is
laid <span style="">by the </span>statute at the door
of the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is no more
need for the claimant to carry the burden of proof to establish his case to the
point of demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient
to show that the hypothesis on which he bases his claim is probable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant is relieved <span style="">from </span>the burden of <span style="">proving </span>causation once the illness or
injury is shown to have arisen in the course of employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To the employer then is shifted the burden of proof to establish
non-compensability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case,
respondent employer has failed to overthrow by substantial evidence the
statutory presumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In resolving the
instant claim of petitioners, the Hearing Officer relied mainly on the medical
report of the attending physician that the ailment, which caused the death of
the deceased, was neither caused nor aggravated by the conditions of his work
as an epidemiological aide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the face
of our ruling, however, that physician's opinions cannot prevail over the
presumption established by <span class="GramE">law,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that</span> report can hardly qualify as substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, there is a divergent medical opinion in the sworn
Medical Certificate of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> M. Mendoza, which
categorically states <span class="GramE">that</span> the deceased</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">was</span> under my medical treatment from <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1 to 6, 1974</st1:date> because of Bleeding
Peptic Ulcer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His illness was acquired
by failure to take food on time while having his field trip in connection with
his work with the Malaria Eradication Service."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, it is well known
that one of the contributing causes of peptic ulcer is repeated failure to take
meals on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased, by the
nature of his work, which involved moving from one locality to another to spray
houses or get blood smears from malaria suspects, had to experience hunger ever
so often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the deceased's Unit
Staff Supervisor </span>and Officer-in-charge, in a Joint Affidavit, attested:</p>

<blockquote>"That, more often than not <span class="SpellE">fieldmen</span>
such as the late <span class="SpellE">Apolinar</span> <span class="SpellE">Villasan</span>
experience hunger, fatigue and thirst.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since field work starts on Monday and ends Friday, there are tines
during hiking when there are no houses where you could cook your food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distances involved in hiking ranges from
1 to 15 <span style="">kilometers </span>and 16 to 35
kilometers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As concrete examples are the
distances involved from lowlands to mountain places of the <span class="SpellE">Igorots</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span> and <span class="SpellE">Negritos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are also tines when they became
stranded because of flooded streams during rainy days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence hunger is inevitable."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As it is, therefore,
petitioners not only have the statutory presumption in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have also shown that the deceased's
illness of peptic ulcer arose out of or was at least aggravated by the nature
or conditions of his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That their
evidence may have been presented only after the dismissal of their case by the
Hearing Officer should not militate against their claim considering that
because of their lowly state in life, their being unlettered, and their being
initially unrepresented by counsel, they could not </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">expected to be knowledgeable of the procedures necessary to establish
their claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission had premised its dismissal
Order of <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">30 January 1976</st1:date> on
the alleged failure of petitioners to perfect an appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, grounded on Department Order No. 3,
Series of 1974, which does not allow motions for extension of time to file
appeal in workmen's compensation cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">A strict application of rules of procedure, however, must yield
to the demands of substantial justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners requested for extension within which to file their motion
for reconsideration in order to afford them enough time to secure the services
of a lawyer as they were unassisted by counsel during the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a justifiable reason that called for
the exercise of sound discretion by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ends of fairness and justice would have
been served thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners had no
intention to delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And more importantly,
petitioners had a valid claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
substantial rights should not be defeated or suppressed by adherence to strict
technicalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the avenues
of justice would be closed to petitioners by leaving them without any remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In having adopted such a rigid stand,
therefore, the Commission acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack of jurisdiction correctible by <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<p class="BODY">That the Workmen's Compensation Commission and sub<span style="">s</span>equently the Compensation Appeals and
Review Staff of the former Department of Labor have not been included as party
respondents should be no deterrent either to the prompt disposition of this
case, and they are hereby deemed <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the
spirit of Act No. 3428, which seeks to promote the expeditious disposal of
workmen's compensation cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, as the Secretary of Labor had <span class="GramE">Voluntarily</span>
entered his appearance and submitted a Comment on the instant Petition through
the Compensation Appeals Review Staff, the question has become moot and
academic.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<p class="BODY">To <span class="GramE">effect</span> substantial justice to the claimants
and to terminate the case here and now,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
we hereby fix the compensation to which petitioners are entitled without
remanding the case for hearing on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners may be granted death compensation in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
requested increased amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> must be
rejected since the instant case falls within the purview of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, which allows the maximum aggregate sum of P6,000.00 only.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of P750.00 prayed for by petitioners, representing
burial expenses, although duly supported by official receipts, cannot be
allowed for being excessive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sum
refundable for burial expenses as provided for under Section 8 of the same Act
is P200.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reimbursement of medical expenses may be allowed as substantiated
by the sworn medical certificate of the attending doctor, despite the
opposition of the Acting Solicitor General on the ground that, as they were
incurred in 1970 and 1972, they are too remote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted, however, that the claim for medical expenses was
filed with us, by way of a Motion, on <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="10">30
 October 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that
the illness was contracted by the deceased in 1970, the ten-year prescriptive
period computed from the time of the onset of the illness to the date of the
filing of the claim had not yet elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, too, that the total medical expenses sought to be refunded
is a reasonable and modest amount, and, in the light of the liberal construction
of the Act in favor of the workman and his dependents, the claim should be
granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>
