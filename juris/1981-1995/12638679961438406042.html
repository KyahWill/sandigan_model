Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental in Civil
Case No. </span><span style="">4867, </span><span style="">entitled "Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lugait</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental,
(represented) by the Municipal Treasurer and Provincial Treasurer vs. <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Cement Corporation", ordering defendant to pay
unto plaintiff the amount of P161,875.00 as manufacturer's and exporter's taxes
plus surcharges for the period from January 1, 1974 to September 30, 1975, and
that herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> </span>Cement
Corporation be declared exempted from the coverage of<span style=""> </span>Ordinances Nos. 5 and 10 of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lugait</span> and that the taxes and fees it has paid pursuant to
said ordinances be refunded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, as summarized <span style="">in </span>the decision of the trial court, are <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lugait</span>,
province of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, represented jointly in
this action by its Municipal Treasurer and the Provincial Treasurer of the said
province, filed with this Court a verified complaint for collection of taxes
against the defendant <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Cement Corporation, a
domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic
of the Philippines with business establishment and office address at its
compound in the aforementioned municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lugait</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taxes sought to be collected by the
plaintiff specifically refers to 'manufacturer's' and 'exporter's' taxes for
the period from January 1, 1974 to September 30, 1975, inclusive, in the total
amount of P161,875.00<span style="">&nbsp; </span>plus 25% thereof
as surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff alleged that the
imposition and collection of these taxes is based on its Municipal Ordinance <span style="">No. </span>5, otherwise known as the Municipal
Revenue Code of 1974, which was passed pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 231
dated June 28, 1973 and also Municipal Ordinance No. 10 passed on June 11, 1974
pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 426 dated March 30, 1974, amending Presi­dential
Decree No. 231.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In its answer to the complaint, the defendant set up the defense
that it is not liable to pay manufacturer's and exporter's taxes alleging among
others that the plaintiff's power to levy and collect taxes, fees, rentals,
royalties or charges of any kind whatsoever on defendant has been limited <span style="">or </span>withdrawn by Section 52 of
Presidential Decree No. 463 which provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Sec. 52.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Power to Levy
Taxes on Mines, Mining Corporation and Mineral Products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, no
province, city, munici­pality, barrio or municipal district shall levy and
collect taxes, fees, rentals, royalties <span style="">or
</span>charges of any kind whatsoever on mines, mining claims, mineral
products, or on any operation, process or activity connected therewith.'</p>

<blockquote>Defendant also set up several
special/affirmative defenses, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue; (2) that the complaint
states no cause; (3) that plaintiff has absolutely no cause of action against
defendant; (4) that defendant was granted by the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources a Certificate of Qualification for Tax Exemption, CQTE No.
22, dated July 7, 1960, entitling defendant to exemption for a period of five
(5) years from April 30, 1969 to April 29, 1974 from payment of all taxes,
except income tax, and which Certificate was amended on November 5, 1974 (CQTE
P.D. 463-22), entitling defendant to exemption from all taxes, duties and fees
except income tax, for five (5) years from the first date of actual commercial
production of saleable mineral products that is from May 17, 1974 to January 1,
1978; and (5) that Republic Act No. 3823, as implemented by Mines
Administrative Order No. V-25, and P.D. No. 463 which are the basis for the
exemption granted to defendant are special laws; whereas, the municipal
ordinance mentioned in the complaint which are based on P.D. No. 231 and P.D. No.
426, respectively, are general laws; and that it is axiomatic that a special
law can not be amended and/or repealed by a general law unless there is an
express intent to repeal or abrogate the provisions of the special law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the issues were joined, the parties sub­mitted a written
stipulation of facts under date of <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="5">May
 21, 1976</st1:date> the pertinent portion of which is quoted in full as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'PLAINTIFF and DEFENDANT, by and through counsel, most respectfully
submit the following stipulation of facts:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff a political subdivision of the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
created pursuant to EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 425, entitled "CREATING THE
MUNICIPALITY OF LUGAIT, IN THE PROVINCE OF MISAMIS ORIENTAL", a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of said executive order is attached hereto

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That defendant, as a mining operator of
mineral land/lands situated at <span class="SpellE">Lugait</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, was granted by the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources a Certificate of Qualification for Tax
Exemption, CQTE No. 22, dated July 7, 1960, entitling defendant to exemption
for a period of five (5) years from April 30, 1969 to April 29, 1974, from the
payment of all taxes, except income tax, a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy
of which is attached marked ANNEX "A" to defendant's answer and made
an integral part hereof;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Certificate of Qualifica­tion for
Tax Exemption mentioned in the next preceding paragraph was amended on November
5, 1974, when the Honorable Secretary of Natural Resources, Mr. Jose J. <span class="SpellE">Leido</span>, Jr., upon recommendation of the Director of Mines,
granted to defendant a Certificate of Qualification for Tax Exemption, CQTE
P.D. 463-22, which entitled defendant to exemption from all taxes, duties, and
fees, except income tax, for five (5) years from May 17, 1974 to January 1,
1978, a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of which is attached marked ANNEX
"B" to defendant's answer and made an integral part hereof; and that
a copy of the Certificate of Qualification for Tax Exemption, CQTE P.D. 463-22

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Certificate of Qualifica­tion for
Tax Exemption mentioned in the next preceding paragraph was issued pursuant to
the provisions of Sec. 52, P.D. No. 463, which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="3Q">"Sec. 52.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Power to Levy

therewith."</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on or about July 3, 1974, plaintiff,
through its Municipal Mayor, wired the Secretary of Finance, opposing the
application of defendant for the extension of its exemption from all forms of
taxation, including its application for extension of its exemption from realty
taxes, which opposition was not favorably acted upon by the said Secretary of
Finance, as evidenced by a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the letter
of the Honorable Secretary of Finance, Mr. Cesar <span class="SpellE">Virata</span>,
attached hereto marked ANNEX "C" and made an integral part hereof;</p>

promulgated on June 28, 1973, passed Municipal Ordinance No. 5, otherwise known
as Municipal Revenue Code of 1974, effective January 1, 1974, Section 3 of
which is quoted in paragraph 2 of the complaint and made integral part hereof

including surcharge for the period covering January 1, 1974 to September 30,
1975, broken down as shown in paragraph 5 of the complaint and made integral
part hereof by reference; but defendant refused because of the allegations
found in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hereof.</p>

<p class="2Q">WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that the foregoing
stipulation of <span style="">facts </span>be made the

<p class="BODY">As aforementioned, the trial court rendered its decision on <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1976</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads, as follows:</p>

inclusive, and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was given due course by the First Division of this
Court on <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1978</st1:date> and
both parties were required to submit their simultaneous memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent complied on <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1978</st1:date> while petitioner filed its
memorandum on <st1:date year="1978" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue in this case is whether or not Ordinances
Nos. 5 and 10 of <span class="SpellE">Lugait</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental apply to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Corporation
notwithstanding the limitation on <span style="">the </span>taxing
power of local government as provided for in Sec. 5(m) of <span style="">P.D. </span>231 and Sec. 52 of P.D. 463.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Cement Corporation
holds that since Ordinances Nos. 5 and 10 were enacted pursuant to P.D. No. 231
and P.D. No. 426, respectively, said ordinances do not apply to its business in
view of the limitation on the taxing power of local government provided in Sec.
5(m) of P.D. No. 231, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Common
Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local Governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exercise of taxing power of provinces,
cities, municipalities and barrios shall not extend to the imposition of the

<blockquote>(m) Taxes on mines,
mining operations and mineral products and their by-products when sold
domestically by the operator."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Cement Corporation likewise
contends that cement <span style="">is a </span>mineral
product, relying on the case of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement
Company vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. L-20563, October 29, 1968
(25 SCRA 789), and <span style="">in </span>the case
of Philippine Pipes and Merchandising Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, CTA Case No. 1858, dated July 29, 1970 decided by the Court of <span style="">Tax </span>Appeals (Memorandum for the
Petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> pp. 89-90).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further contends that the partial exemption
aforementioned was rendered absolute by Sec. 52 of P.D. <span style="">No. </span>463 promulgated on May 17, 1974, which expressly prohibits
the province, city, municipality, barrio and municipal district from levying
and collecting taxes, fees, rentals, royalties or charges of any kind
whatsoever on mines, mining claims and mineral products, any law to the
contrary notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said prohi­bition
includes any operation, process or activity connected with its production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manufacture of cement is a process
inherently connected with the mining operation undertaken by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Cement Corporation <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 92-93).</p>

<p class="BODY">On other hand, while respondent municipality admits that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Cement Corporation undertakes exploration,
development and exploitation of mineral products, the taxes sought to be
collected were not imposed on these activities in view of the mentioned
prohibition under Sec. 52 of P.D. No. 463.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said taxes were levied on the corporation's business of manufacturing
and exporting cement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The business of
manufacturing and exporting cement does not fall under exploration, development
nor exploitation of mineral resources as<span style="">
</span>defined in Sec. 2 of P.D. No. 463, hence, it is outside the scope of
application of Sec. 52 of said decree (Memorandum for Respondent, p. 10; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 85).</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipality's power to levy taxes on manufacturers and
exporters is provided in Article 2, Sec. 19 of P.D. No. 231, as amended by P.D.
No. 426 which provides that "The municipality may impose a tax <span style="">on </span>business except those for which
fixed taxes are provided for <span style="">in </span>this
Code:</p>

<blockquote>"(a) On
manufacturers, importers, or producers of any article of commerce of whatever
kind or nature, including brewers, distillers, rectifiers, <span class="SpellE">repackers</span>,

<blockquote>(Comment of the Respondent, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 72)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of whether or not cement is a mineral product,
this Court has consistently held that it is not a mineral product but rather a
manufactured product (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Portland Cement Company, 156 SCRA 535 [1987]; Commissioner of Internal Revenue
vs. Philippine Pipes and Merchandising Corporation, 153 SCRA 113 [1987];
Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Republic Cement Corporation, 149 SCRA 487
[1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While cement is composed of 80%
minerals, it is not merely an admixture or blending of raw materials, as lime,
silica, shale and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
result of a definite process - the crushing of minerals, grinding, mixing, <span class="SpellE">calcining</span>, adding of <span class="SpellE">retarder</span> <span style="">or </span>raw gypsum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, before cement reaches its saleable
form, the minerals had already undergone a chemical change through
manufacturing process (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Portland Cement Company, <u>supra</u>, reiterating the ruling in Commissioner
of Internal Revenue vs. Republic Cement Corporation, 124 46 [1983]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears evident that the foregoing cases
overruled the case of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement Company
vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 25 SCRA 789 [1969] which was cited by
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the exemption claimed by petitioner, this Court has laid down
the rule that <span style="">as </span>the power of
taxation is a high prerogative of sovereignty, the relinquishment is never
presumed and any reduction or <span class="SpellE">dimunition</span> thereof with
respect to its mode or its rate, must be strictly construed, and the same must
be coached in clear and unmistakable terms in order that it may be
applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically stated, the
general rule is that any claim for exemption from the tax statute should be
strictly construed against the taxpayer (Luzon Stevedoring Corporation vs.
Court of Tax Appeals, 163 SCRA 647 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He who claims an exemption must be able to point out some provision of
law creating the right; it <span style="">cannot </span>be
allowed to exist upon a mere vague implication or inference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be shown indubitably to exist, for
every presumption is against it, and a well-founded doubt is fatal to the claim
(Manila Electric Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Ver</span>, 67 SCRA 351
[1975]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner failed to meet
this requirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held by the lower court, the exemption mentioned in Sec. 52 of
P.D. No. 463 refers only to machineries, equipment, tools for production, etc.,
<span style="">as </span>provided in Sec. 53 of the
same decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manufacture and the
export of cement does not fall under the said provision for it is not <span style="">a </span>mineral
product (CFI Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 62).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not cement that is mined, only the
mineral<span style=""> products composing the finished
product (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Republic Cement Corporation, <u>supra</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, by the parties’ own stipulation of facts submitted
before the court <u>a quo</u>, it is admitted that <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
Cement Corporation is engaged in the manufacturing and selling, including
exporting of cement (CFI Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
57).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, and since the taxes sought
to be collected were levied on these activities pursuant to Sec. 19 of P.D. No.
231.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinances Nos. 5 and 10, which
were enacted pursuant to P.D. No. 231 and P.D. No. 426, respectively, properly apply
to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> <span style="">Cement Corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit and
