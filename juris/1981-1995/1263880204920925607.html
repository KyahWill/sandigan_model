issue in this special civil action for <i><u>certiorari</u></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
employees contend that the termination of their employment with the company was
illegally undertaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
the company maintains that the said employees voluntarily resigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus put, the Court is tasked to resolve the
controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The herein petitioners Edmundo Samaniego, Antonio L. Acosta,
Jaime L. Diaz and Pablo Manahan used to be managerial employees of the private
respondent company, <span style="">Sandvik
Philippines, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other private
respondents, Krister Brobeck and Ake Friberg, </span>are <span style="">ranking officials of the said company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime before 1987, the
management was of the view that a serious financial crisis was confronting the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the management
resolved to reorganize the company by streamlining its operations and
eliminating middle management positions, including those of the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The management eventually
decided that the managerial employees so affected by the reorganization should
be given the option of either facing termination of </span>their employment and
receiving separation pay, or resigning voluntarily from the company under terms
more financially advantageous than those as regards the first option.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, as early as
April 1987, three of the petitioners filed a labor case against the company for
the purpose of seeking the payment of certain money claims, and </span>for the
purpose of calling public attention to some alleged anomalous activities of
private respondent Krister Brobeck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
matter, however, remained unresolved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 24, 1987,
representatives of the company held a meeting with the petitioners at the Hotel
intercontinental Manila for the purpose of discussing the company</span>
reorganization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In time, the petitioners
were given the <span style="">following options:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Termination of employment on account of <span style="">the </span>company reorganization, with
payment of separation benefits; or</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Voluntary<span style=""> </span>resignation
from the company, with more benefits.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that the
petitioners negotiated with the company representatives for an improvement of
the benefits under</span> the voluntary resignation option.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the end of the day, no agreement was
reached by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Negotiations were resumed
the next day, August </span>25, <span style="">1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company representatives eventually
offered better benefits under the voluntary resignation option.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three of the petitioners found the proposal
satisfactory and thus accepted the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fourth employee, petitioner Diaz, at first decided to take the first
option but he eventually changed </span><span style="">his
</span><span style="">mind and opted to resign from
the company under the improved terms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners signed company-prepared resignation letters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They acknowledged therein that they have
received the benefits agreed upon and that they have no legal claim against the
company or its officers and repre­sentatives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, the petitioners received the checks corresponding to
their benefits under the voluntary resignation option.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears, however, that
sometime later in </span>the <span style="">day, the
petitioners sent a letter to the company, through </span>registered mail,
informing the latter that they received their benefits under protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, the petitioners deposited their
checks in their respective bank accounts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners Diaz and Samaniego eventually received documents effectively
transferring in their favor the ownership rights over the company vehicles
assigned to them in the course of their employment, pursuant to their corresponding
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In time, the petitioners
received all the benefits appertaining to the voluntary resignation option.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 2, 1987, the
petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, discrimination and damage
against the private respondents before the National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as
NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-09-03062-87 and assigned to Labor Arbiter Ceferina J. </span>Diosana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A formal trial on the merits ensued and upon
the conclusion thereof, the parties submitted their respective memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, the petitioners contended <span style="">that the termination of their employment was
illegally undertaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondents maintained that this case is one of voluntary resignation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 28, 1989, the labor arbiter rendered a <span style="">decision in favor of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The labor arbiter opined that the
reorganization of the company was merely </span>a <span style="">scheme to dismiss the petitioners inasmuch as the same was haphazardly
carried out and considering the haste attending the termination of the
employment of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The labor
arbiter also opined that the termination of the employment of the petitioners
was in retaliation against them for the complaint they filed against the
private respondents earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sum, the
labor arbiter concluded that the petitioners did not voluntarily sign their
resignation letters.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The private respondents
brought an</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">appeal to the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 24, 1990, the NLRC promulgated a
resolution setting aside the decision of the labor arbiter and entering a new
one dismissing the complaint filed by the petitioners.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The NLRC stressed that the issue to be
resolved is not whether the company reorganization was valid, but whether or
not the petitioners voluntarily resigned from the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All told, the NLRC held that the petitioners
voluntarily resigned from the company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pertinent portions of the said resolution are quoted herein --<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The issue <span style="">in </span>this
case is not whether the company's reorganization announced <span style="">to </span>the complainants (the herein
petitioners) on August 24, 1987 is valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, the pivotal issue is whether or not <span style="">the </span>complainants voluntarily resigned from the xxx company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appeal<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is impressed
with merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the findings of
the Arbiter <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, there is nothing on record which will support
her conclusions that the complainants were terminated in due haste, much less
under the guise of a reorganization.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps because of this mistaken impression, the issues were diverted to
whether or not there was an honest - to goodness reorganization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular issue, however, is material
only if the complainants were indeed dismissed from employment due to said
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of the case do not
show that this is the controversy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Although it is true that in the morning of August 24, 1987,
the complainants were notified that their positions would be abolished due to
the company's reorganization program and hence, their services will no longer
be needed, it is equally true that their termination from employment did not
materialize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that
notwithstanding the announced reorganization plan of the company, the
respondents offered the complainants an alternative avenue for exit which is
voluntary resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see nothing
illegal with this approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
practice of allowing an employee to resign instead of being terminated for just
cause so as not to smear his employment record is commonly practiced in some
companies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">xxx.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the present case, the propriety of the choice given to the
complainants by the company is even reinforced by the fact that the separation
benefits due to resignation offered to them were much higher than what they
would receive under termination due to the reorganization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A more attractive scheme, therefore, was
merely tendered to the complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was not imposed upon them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, two
of the complainants, xxx, admitted in their testimonies that they were made to
choose between the two (2) options xxx.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if they eventually chose the alternative of resigning from the
company with greater benefits, as in this case, the complainants cannot
subsequently repudiate their choice nor be heard to say later on that they were
terminated without just cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
inconsistent with dismissal (where the concerned employee is left with no
option).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In termination cases, the
employer decides for the employee and not the other way around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the complainants decided
to resign.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx. In their resignation letters, they all acknowledged
receipt of substantial amounts of money plus the transfer of the company car
assigned to them as part of their compensation package.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also no dispute that this package is
greater than that provided by law or the separation pay that may be d<span style="">ue </span>on account of the reorganization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These benefits, in turn, were obtained <span style="">by </span>the complainants through
negotiations and haggling with the company <span style="">xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Under the circumstan­ces,
it is difficult to believe that the complainants were really forced to resign
so as to render their act nugatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be noted that it took the complainants at least one day before they signed
their resignation letters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
interim, complainant Manahan even admitted that he had already consulted his
lawyer before he signed his resignation letter the following day xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the lapse of time, it is evident
that the complainants had the opportunity to carefully deliberate on <span style="">their </span>choices and evaluate the
consequence thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, there
intervened <span style="">a </span>sufficient period
of time that enabled the complainants to meditate and decide on their
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the absence of force or compulsion
is also evident from the fact that complainants did not sign their resignation
letters <span style="">on </span>that meeting of
August 24, 1987 but rather, they stalled and executed the said documents only
the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We take note that the complainants were not
ordinary laborers who may not be able to fully appreciate the consequences of
their acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were all admittedly
managerial employees holding responsible positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-educated and experienced in various
business dealings on account of their high positions, complainants very well
know that their resignation constituted a bar against any charge of unlawful
dismissal and they cannot now be allowed to conveniently invalidate or
disregard the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this connection, we also doubt the accuracy of the
impression of the Labor Arbiter <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that the company's act was
in retaliation to the actions taken by the complainants against Mr.
Brobeck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx, had the respondent company really wanted
to retaliate against the complainants, then they should have been terminated
outrightly by virtue of the reorganization, rather than being given the
opportunity to voluntarily resign and receive higher financial compensation
packages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, this act of the
respondent company negates any allegation of vindictivenes or retaliatory
attitude.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All <span style="">told, </span>it is
evident that the surrounding circumstances of the case indubitably point to the
conclusion that complainant's resignation from the company was valid and hence,
operated <span style="">to </span>effectively sever the
employment rela­tionship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, the fact that complainant Samaniego, on September
1987, immediately assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer of Universal
Sales, Inc., a corporation similar to, if not in competition with, respondent
company, is highly indicative of <span style="">his </span>intention
to really leave the company and work elsewhere xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His subsequent employment thereat as one of
the highest executives barely a few days after he tendered his resignation is
an unmistakable sign of his decision to relinquish his position at the company
and sever his employment relationship."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 4, 1990, the petitioners
elevated the case to this Court by way of the instant petition.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is alleged therein that the decision of

its “Manifestation In Lieu Of Comment" praying therein that the challenged
resolution be set aside and the decision of the labor arbiter be
reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General opines
that the petitioners did not voluntarily resign from the company inasmuch as
they were forced to choose between two extreme choices, and that the receipt of
separation benefits does not bar them from contesting the validity of their
dismissal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Considering the position taken by the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In due time, the case was
deemed submitted for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After a careful
evaluation of the entire record of the case, the Court finds the petition
devoid of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As correctly pointed out
by the NLRC, the issue to be resolved is not whether the company reorganization
is valid, but whether or not the petitioners voluntarily resigned from the
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The discussions relating
to the validity of the company reorganization are, therefore, immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This matter is pertinent only if the
petitioners were indeed dismissed from their employment due to </span><span style="">such </span><span style="">reorganization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is
convinced that this is a case of voluntary resignation on the part of the
petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be emphasized
that notwithstanding the intended reorganization of the company, the
petitioners were given the option to resign from the company with corresponding
benefits attending such option.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
opted for resignation on account of these negotiated benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In termination cases, the employee is not
afforded any option; the employee is dismissed and his only recourse is to
institute a complaint for illegal dismissal against his employer, assuming of
course that there are valid grounds for doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, the petitioners were
given the option to resign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the
option they chose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there is no
illegal dismissal to speak of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record is devoid of
any indication that the petitioners were coerced into resigning from the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">contrary, the record supports the view that the petitioners chose to
resign without any element of coercion attending their option.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners negotiated for an improvement
of the resignation package offered to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The negotiations lasted for at least two days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">matter of fact, they
managed to obtain a better package under the voluntary resignation option.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Manahan even admitted that he
consulted his lawyer before he signed his </span>resignation letter.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Some of the petitioners managed to obtain ownership rights over the company
vehicles originally assigned to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners admittedly deposited the checks given to them by the
company in their respective bank accounts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If their intention was to <span style="">receive
their benefits in protest, they could have just held on to the checks instead
of depositing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the
resignation letters signed by the petitioners were apparently prepared by the
company, it is important to note that the petitioners signed the same
voluntarily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It must he emphasized as
well that the petitioners are not ordinary laborers or rank-and-file personnel
who may not be able to completely comprehend and realize </span>the <span style="">consequences of their acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="">petitioners are managerial employees holding responsible
positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are educated
individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For his part, petitioner
Samaniego immediately assumed a ranking position in a competing company after
his resignation from Sandvik Philippines, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circumstances, it can hardly be said that they were coerced
into resigning from the company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General
maintains that receipt of separation pay is not a bar to contesting the
legality of dismissal from employment.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The observation is beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, there is no illegal
dismissal in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the foregoing, it
clearly appears that the petitioners voluntarily resigned from the company for
a valuable consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quitclaim
they executed in favor of the company amounts to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a valid and binding
compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow the
petitioners to repudiate the same will be to countenance unjust enrichment on
their part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court will not permit
such a situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>At this juncture, We find it appropriate to
call attention to Our pronouncement in <u>Periquet v. National Relations

<blockquote>"Not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against public
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the agreement was voluntarily
entered into and represents a reasonable settle­ment, it is binding on the
parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only where there is clear proof that
the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting <span style="">or </span>gullible person, or the terms of settlement are unconscionable
on its face, that the law <span style="">will </span>step
in to annul the questionable transaction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But where it is shown that the person making the waiver did so
voluntarily, with full understanding of what he was doing, and the
consideration for the quitclaim is credible and reasonable, the transaction
must be recognized as a valid and binding undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This observation holds
true for the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
