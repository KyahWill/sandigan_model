				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This suit involves a boundary dispute between owners of adjoining
lots situated in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Miag-ao</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judgment was rendered by the former Court of
First <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Instance of Iloilo, Branch III,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> dismissing the Complaint filed by private
respondents, the NICOS, as well as the Counterclaim of petitioners, the
FLORESES.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Trial Court was of the
opinion that "neither the plaintiffs (the </span>NICOS) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nor the defendants (the FLORESES) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">were </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">able to sufficiently establish that the areas claimed by them really
belong to them."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by the NICOS, the then Intermediate Appellate Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
reversed stating that "the discrepancy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">in </span>the area may not justify the position of the lower Court in
refusing to declare who owns the disputed portion to check constant <span class="SpellE">strifes</span> between the neighbors." It then <span class="SpellE">dispositively</span> decreed:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision a quo is hereby REVERSED and set aside and
another one is rendered declaring plaintiffs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">(</span>the NICOS) as the owners of the disputed portion <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span><u>222</u> square meters, more or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">less, as indicated </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

(the FLORESES) to demolish the fence erected by them and intruding into the
land of plaintiff, and directing defendants to surrender possession thereof and
to desist from further disturbing or claiming possession of the disputed
portion awarded to the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
damages and costs." (Emphasis ours).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this recourse by the <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place>
seeking a reversal of the aforesaid judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="7">30 July 1986</st1:date>,
after receiving the Comment of the NICOS, we resolved to deny the Petition for
lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion for reconsideration of the FLORESES, on the ground
that the Appellate Court findings with respect to the areas of the respective
properties of the parties as well as the disputed portion were "totally
without factual b<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a</span>sis," we
remanded the case on 21 September <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1987 </span>to
respondent Appellate Court for determination of the exact area in dispute “in
the interest of a more accurate determination of the controversy" and to
"DECIDE the case accordingly." In effect, we had granted
reconsideration and reinstated the Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="4">12 April 1988</st1:date>,
the Appellate Court promulgated an Amended Decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
modifying the area of the disputed portion to <u>199</u> square meters only and
maintaining the rest of its dispositions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place> moved for reconsideration urging
that the Amended Decision affirm instead the judgment of the Trial Court <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">toto</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This
was denied by the Appellate Court stating that the issue of ownership of the
disputed piece of land was before this Court; that in so far as it was
concerned its finding thereon was final; and that it had already resolved the
true area of the disputed portion as ordered by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners FLORESES then filed before the Appellate Court a
Manifestation and Motion praying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for </span>the
elevation of the case to this Court for proper disposition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was opposed by respondents NICOS on the
ground that the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with this Court had already been
denied for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="8">25 August 1989</st1:date> respondent Court
rejected this contention and ordered the elevation of the records to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">us </span>since it had already complied with
our Resolution of <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="9">21 September 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We received the records on <st1:date year="1989" day="1" month="9">1 September 1989</st1:date>, and the case was
included in the Agenda of <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="9">18 September
 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the area in controversy now accurately determined by
respondent Appellate Court, the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>back
with us for action on the Petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
resolved to give due course and to decide the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts show that the NICOS own Assessors Lot No.
71, located at the corner of <st1:street><st1:address>Delgado Street</st1:address></st1:street>
and the national highway, <span class="SpellE">Miag-ao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Iloilo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The
NICOS claim that the area of their lot is 689 square meters as shown by Tax
Declarations (Exhibits "A", "A-1" and "B") and
the sketch plans duly certified by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Office
</span>of the Provincial Assessor (Exhibits "C" and "D");
and that they have been in possession of that property since 1936.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place>
own the adjoining Assessors Lot No. 72.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their allegation is that this lot has an area of 3,173 square meters
pursuant to the Deed of Sale in their favor dated 11 January 1967 (Exhibit
"11") and as shown by Tax Declarations (Exhibits "1" to “<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">5" </span>inclusive).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A sketch plan however, also indicates that
the area is 3,083 square meters (Exhibit “7”).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both lots are unregistered properties.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1975, the <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place> constructed
a bamboo fence, and in 1978 March, a hollow-block fence to separate the two
adjoining properties, over the strong protest of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">NICOS </span>who alleged that the construction encroached upon a
portion of their property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place>
refused to heed the protest, on <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="4">19
 April 1978</st1:date>, the NICOS filed an action for “Recovery of Real
Property with Damages" before the Trial Court of Iloilo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
thereof, the predecessor-in-interest of the NICOS died and the latter, her
children, were substituted in her stead.</p>

<p class="BODY">As heretofore stated, the Appellate Court, even in its Amended
Decision, ruled that the disputed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">area </span>of 199 square meters belongs to the
NICOS and that the <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place> should demolish the fence
they had erected as it intrudes into the NICOS property.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a review of the evidence, which we had ordered elevated, we
find some misapprehension of facts by the Appellate Court, sufficient to affect
the outcome of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We derive our bearings from Exhibit "N", the Report by
the Commissioners appointed by the Court, and Exhibit "N-1", the plan
they had submitted, both of which have been admitted by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From those documents, we find the following <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>established:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the aggregate area disputed is, indeed,
199 square meters, Lot A of 55 square meters being claimed by the FLORESES, and
Lot B of 144 square meters by the NICOS, (2) the uncontested area belonging to
the NICOS is 419 square meters; while (3) the uncontested area for the FLORESES
is 2,883 square meters (all per Exhibit "N-1").</p>

<p class="BODY">Like the Trial Court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">we </span>find that neither party has proven its
entitlement to the entire disputed portion of 199 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Much less has either party convincingly shown
the dividing line between their two properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">contrary to </span>the basic
rule that in an action to recover, the person who claims that he has a better
right to the property must prove both ownership and identity (<span class="SpellE">Laluan</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Malpaya</span>, L-21231, July 30, 1975, 65 SCRA 494; Article 434,
Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we deem it
best to divide the disputed area between the parties equally, or 99.5 square
meters for each of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This will give
the NICOS 518.5 square meters (419 sq. ms. + 99.5 sq. ms.), short by 170.5
square meters of their claimed 689 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place>, for
their part, will get 2,982.5 square meters (2,883 sq. ms. + 99.5 sq. ms.), also
less by 190.5 square meters from their claim of 3,173 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, to the Court is the most equitable
solution considering the attendant circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court theory of acquisitive prescription by the
NICOS is not well taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the NICOS
may have been in possession of their lot since 1936 in the concept of owners
and planted trees thereon, these are insufficient to delineate boundaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bamboo fences respectively built by the
parties (Exhibit "P"), relied upon by the Appellate Court, do not
conclusively appear either as clear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dividing
</span>lines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sketch, Exhibit
"F", neither unmistakably proves ownership by the NICOS of the
disputed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">area of "222" </span>square
meters, as found by respondent Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place> will necessarily have to
demolish their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">concrete fence </span>and
move it towards the resulting boundary, but they have only themselves to blame
since they proceeded with its construction despite the verbal and written
protests of the NICOS.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment under review is hereby SET ASIDE
and another one rendered declaring the NICOS the owners of Assessors Lot No. 1
with an area of 518.5 square meters, and the FLORESES, the owners of Assessors
Lot No. 2, with an area of 2,982.5 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The resulting boundary between the two lots
will have to be adjusted accordingly, the expenses for survey and <span class="SpellE">monumenting</span> to be borne equally by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The concrete fence that the <st1:place>FLORESES</st1:place>
had constructed shall be demolished at their expense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
