<p class="BODY">It appears that on 25 January 1963, petitioner filed a
Miscellaneous Sales Application for Lot No. 1641, Ts-308 of the Olongapo
Townsite Subdivision, Lower Kalaklan, Olongapo City, with the District Land
Officer, Bureau of Lands, Olongapo City.  Sometime in December 1970, alleging that she was forcibly dispossessed
of a portion of the land by a certain Ben Babol, she instituted a complaint for
forcible entry before the City Court of Olongapo City, docketed as Civil Case
No. 926, stating in pars. 2 and 3 therein that -</p>

<blockquote>x x x plaintiff is the true, lawful and in actual, prior physical
possession of a certain parcel of land situated at Lower Kalaklan, City of
Olongapo, said lot being designated as Lot No. 1641, Ts-308 of the Olongapo
Townsite Subdivision since 1961 and up to the present time, until the day and
incidents hereinafter narrated x x x x  Sometime on December 12, 1970, the defendant, without express consent of
plaintiff and without lawful authority, through scheme, strategy and stealth,
forcibly entered a portion on the southwestern part of Lot No. 1641, Ts-308,
with the assistance of hired helpers, started construction of riprap along the
Kalaklan River perimeter of said portion of land; said entry was further
augmented by removing plaintiff's chain link, fence with galvanized iron posts
embedded in concrete, likewise destroying plants introduced by plaintiff by
removing existing BL (Bureau of Lands) monuments thereon, and by these actions,
defendant started exercising illegal possession of said portion of land which
contains an area of 200 square meters, more or less.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 7 November 1972 the City Court of Olongapo City, Br. 4,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

dismissed the appeal and affirmed the findings and conclusions of the City
Court holding that appellant (herein petitioner) failed to give sufficient
evidence to prove that the area in question was within the boundaries of Lot
No. 1641.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on 17 December 1973, petitioner was granted
Miscellaneous Sales Patent No. 5548 and issued Original Certificate of Title
No. P-3259 covering Lot No. 1641.  Meanwhile, Ben Babol who was the defendant and appellee in the complaint
for forcible entry had sold the property he was occupying, including the
portion of about 200 square meters in question, to a certain Reino Rosete.  Thus petitioner demanded the surrender of
the same area in dispute from Reino Rosete who repeatedly refused to comply
with the demand.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 June 1977, or after about four <span style="">(4) </span>years from the finality of the dismissal of Civil Case No.
926, petitioner instituted a complaint for quieting of title and recovery of
possession with damages against Ben Babol and Reino Rosete before the then
Court of First Instance of Zambales and Olongapo City, docketed as Civil Case
No. 2203-0, alleging in pars. 2 and 3 therein that -</p>

<blockquote>x x x plaintiff is the absolute owner in fee simple of a parcel of

property of about 200 square meters, then by defendant BEN BABOL and now by

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing a responsive pleading, therein defendant Reino
Rosete (private respondent herein) moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground
of <i><span style="">res </span></i><i><span style="">judicata</span></i><span style="">.  </span>Defendant Ben Babol
did not file any pleading.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Order dated 27 January 1978,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> the

sustained the argument of Rosete and granted his motion to dismiss.  Thereafter, petitioner's motion for
reconsideration was denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner contends that </span><i><span style="">res judicata</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">cannot
apply in the instant case since there is no identity of parties and causes of
action between her complaint for forcible entry, which had long become final
and executory, and her subsequent petition for quieting of title.  She argues that private respondent Reino
Rosete, who invokes the defense of<i> </i></span><i><span style="">res judicata</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">was never impleaded in the forcible entry
case, which is an action </span><i><span style="">in</span></i><span style=""> <i>personam</i>; </span><span style="">neither was he </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">purchaser </span><i><span style="">pendente lite</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">who,
perhaps, could have validly invoked the defense of </span><i><span style="">res judicata</span></i><span style="">.  </span><span style="">With regard to the cause of action, she
maintains that there is no identity of causes of action since the first case
was for forcible entry, which is merely concerned with the possession of </span>the
property, whereas the subsequent case was for quieting of title, which looks
into the ownership of the disputed land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent
however submits that there is identity of parties in the two cases since he is </span><span style="">a successor </span><span style="">in interest by title of the defendant in the first case after the
commencement of the first action.  On
the issue of identity of causes of action, he simply states that neither of the
two cases, i.e., the complaint for forcible entry and the subsequent petition
for quieting of title, alleges a cause of action.  Thus, private respondent continues, both cases have to be
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Time and again it has been said that for <i>res judicata</i> to bar
the institution of a subsequent action the following requisites must
concur:  (1) There must be a final
judgment or order; (2) The court rendering the judgment must have jurisdiction
over the subject matter; (3) The former judgment is a judgment on the merits;
and, (4) There is between the first and second actions identity of parties, of
subject matter and of causes of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> The
presence of the first three requirements and the identity of subject matter in
the fourth requirement are not disputed.  Hence, the only issues remaining are whether as between Civil Case No.
926 and Civil Case No. 2203-0 there is identity of parties and of causes of
action which would bar the institution of Civil Case No. 2203-0.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's argument that there is no identity of parties
between the two actions is without merit.  We <span style="">have repeatedly ruled that
for </span><i><span style="">res </span></i><i><span style="">judicata</span></i><span style=""> to apply, what is required is not absolute but only substantial
identity of parties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is fundamental that the application of<i>
</i></span><i><span style="">res </span></i><i><span style="">judicata</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">may </span><span style="">not be evaded by simply including additional
parties in a subsequent litigation.  In
fact we have said that there is still identity of parties although in the
second action there is one party who was not joined in the first action, if it
appears that such party is not a necessary party either in the first or second
action,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or is a mere nominal party.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, Sec. 49, par. (b), Rule 39, Rules of
Court, provides that "x </span>x <span style="">x
the judgment or order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to
any other matter that could have been raised in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">relation thereto,
conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title
subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating
for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, it is evident that private respondent Reino
Rosete is a successor in interest of <span style="">Ben
Babol by title subsequent to the commencement and termination of the first
action.  Hence, there is actual, if not
substantial, identity of parties between the two actions.  But, there is merit in petitioner's argument
that there is no identity of causes of action between Civil Case No. 926 and
Civil Case No. 2203-0.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Civil Case No. 926 is a
complaint for forcible entry, where what is at issue is prior possession,
regardless of who has lawful title over the disputed property.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, "[t]he only issue in an action
for forcible entry is the physical or material possession of real property,
that is, possession <i>de </i></span><i><span style="">facto</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
not possession </span><i><span style="">de jure</span></i><span style="">.  </span><span style="">The philosophy underlying this remedy is that
irrespective of the actual condition of the title to the property, the party in
peaceable quiet possession shall not be turned out by strong hand, violence or
terror."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And, a judgment rendered in a case for
recovery of possession is conclusive only on the question of possession and not
on the ownership.  It does not in any
way bind the title or affect the ownership of the land or building.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, Civil
Case No. 2203-0 while inaccurately captioned as an action for "Quieting of
Title and Recovery of Possession with Damages" is in reality an action to
recover a parcel of land or an </span><i>accion reivindicatoria</i> <span style="">under Art. 434</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the Civil Code, and should be
distinguished from Civil Case No. 926, which is an </span><i>accion interdictal</i>.  <span style="">From
the averments of the complaint in Civil Case No. 2203-0, plaintiff therein
(petitioner herein) clearly sets up title to herself and prays that respondent
Rosete be ejected from the disputed land and that she be declared the owner and
given possession thereof.  Certainly,
the allegations partake of the nature of an </span><i>accion reivindicatoria</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

recovery of ownership and includes the </span><i>jus utendi</i> <span style="">and the </span><i>jus fruendi</i> <span style="">brought in the proper regional trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Accion reivindicatoria</i> <span style="">or </span><i>accion de reivindicacion</i> is <span style="">thus an action whereby plaintiff alleges ownership over a parcel of
land and seeks recovery of </span>its <span style="">full
possession.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is different from </span><i>accion

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 926 petitioner merely claimed a better right or
prior possession over the disputed area without asserting title thereto.  It should be distinguished from Civil Case
No. 2203-0 where she expressly alleged ownership, specifically praying that she
be declared the rightful owner and given possession of the disputed
portion.  Hence, in Civil Case No. 926
petitioner merely alleged that she was "the true, lawful (possessor) and
in actual, prior physical possession" of the subject parcel of land,
whereas in Civil Case No. 2203-0 she asserted that she was "the absolute
owner in fee simple" of the parcel of land "covered by Original
Transfer Certificate of Title No. P-3259." The complaint in Civil Case No.
2203-0 definitely raises the question of ownership and clearly gives defendants
therein notice of plaintiff's claim of exclusive and absolute ownership,
including the right to possess which is an elemental attribute of such
ownership.  Thus, this Court has ruled
that a judgment in a forcible entry or detainer case disposes of no other issue
than possession and declares only who has the right of possession, but by no
means constitutes a bar to an action for determination of who has the right or
title of ownership.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

2203-0 as a petition to quiet title, as its caption suggests, still it has a
cause of action different from that for ejectment.  Consequently, there being no identity of causes of action between
Civil Case No. 926 and Civil Case No. 2203-0, the prior complaint for ejectment
cannot bar the subsequent action for recovery, or petition to quiet title.</p>
