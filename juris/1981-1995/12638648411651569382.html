learning about the delay in the remittance of the money to petitioner, FACETS
informed FNSB about the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On

FACETS informed private respondent about the delay and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

payment through the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank (hereinafter
referred to as PCIB) instead of PNB.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, private respondent, which was also unaware that
petitioner had already received the remittance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of $10,000.00 from PNB instructed the PCIB to, pay $10,000.00 to

<p class="BODY">Private respondent debited the account of FNSB for the second
$10,000.00 remittance <span class="GramE">effected</span> through PCIB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, when FNSB discovered that private
respondent had made a duplication of the remittance, it asked for a <span class="SpellE">recredit</span> of its account in the amount of $10,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent complied with the request.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent asked petitioner for the return of the second
remittance of $10,000.00 but the latter refused to pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="5">May
 12, 1982</st1:date> a complaint was filed with the Regional Trial Court,
Branch CV, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city> which was decided in favor of petitioner as
defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court ruled that
Art. 2154 of the New Civil Code <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>not
applicable to the case because the second remittance was made not by mistake
but by negligence and petitioner was not unjustly enriched by virtue thereof
[Record, p. 234.] On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that Art. 2154 is
applicable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>reversed the RTC
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the Court of Appeals' decision reads as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE

equivalent in Philippine currency, with interests at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">legal </span>rate from the filing of the
complaint on May 12, 1982 until the whole amount is fully paid, plus twenty

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, this petition was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue in this case is whether or not the private
respondent has the right to recover the second $10,000.00 remittance it had delivered
to petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of this
issue would hinge on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">applicability </span>of
Art. 2154 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the New Civil Code
which provides that:</p>

through mistake, the obligation to return it arises.<span style="font-size:

<p class="BODY">This provision is taken from Art. 1895 of the Spanish Civil Code
which provided that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Art. 1895.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If a thing is

<p class="BODY">In <u>Velez</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Balzarza</u></span>,
73 Phil. 630 (1942), the Court, speaking through Mr<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">. </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span> explained the nature
of this article thus:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Article 1895 [now Article 2154] of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This legal provision, which
determines the quasi-contract of <span class="SpellE"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">solutio</span></b></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><b>indebiti</b></span>, </span>is one of the concrete
manifestations of the ancient principle that no one shall enrich himself
unjustly at the expense of another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the Roman Law Digest the maxim was formulated thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Jure</span> <span class="SpellE">naturae</span> <span class="SpellE">acquum</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">est</span></span>, <span class="SpellE">neminem</span>

legislation, in the science of law and in court decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lawmaker has found it one of the helpful
guides in framing statutes and codes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>unfolded in
many articles scattered in the Spanish Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See for example, articles,

</span>It has been accepted by the courts, which have not hesitated to apply it

justice upon which judicial discretion draws whenever the statutory laws are
inadequate because they do not speak or do so with a confused voice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 632.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For this article to apply the following requisites must
concur:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"(1) that he who paid was
not under obligation to do so; and, (2) that payment was made by reason of an
essential mistake of fact" [City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Piccio</span>, 110 Phil. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">558,
</span>563 (1960).]<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that private respondent delivered the second
$10,000.00 remittance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
petitioner contends that the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">solutio</span></b></span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">indebiti</span></span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>does not apply because its requisites
are absent.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, it is argued that petitioner had the right to demand and
therefore to retain the second $10,000.00 remittance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that even after the two
$10,000.00 remittances are credited to petitioner’s receivables from FACETS,
the latter allegedly still had a balance of $49,324.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is argued that the last $10,000.00
remittance being in payment of a pre-existing debt, petitioner was not thereby
unjustly enriched.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contract of petitioner, as regards the sale of garments and
other textile products, was with FACETS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was the latter and not private respondent which was indebted to
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
contract for the transmittal of dollars from the United States to petitioner
was entered into by private respondent with FNSB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, although named as the payee was
not privy to the contract of remittance of dollars.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither was private respondent a party to the
contract of sale between petitioner and FACETS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There being no contractual relation between them, petitioner has no
right to apply the second $10,000.00 remittance delivered by mistake by private
respondent to the outstanding account of FACETS.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next contends that the payment by respondent bank of
the second $10,000.00 remittance was not made by mistake but was the result of
negligence of its employees.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with this the Court of Appeals made the following
finding of facts:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The fact that Facets sent only one remittance of $10,000.00 is not
disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the written interrogatories
sent to the First National State Bank of New Jersey through the Consulate
General of the Philippines in New York, Adelaide C. <span class="SpellE">Schachel</span>,
the investigation and reconciliation clerk in the said bank testified that a
request to remit a payment for Facet<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">Funwear</span> Inc. was made in August, 1980.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The total amount which the First National
State Bank of New Jersey actually requested the plaintiff-appellant
Manufacturers Hanover &amp; Trust Corporation to remit to Irene's Wearing
Apparel was US$10,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only one remittance
was requested by First National State Bank of New Jersey as per instruction of
Facets <span class="SpellE">Funwear</span> (Exhibit "J", pp. 4-5).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>That there was a mistake in the second remittance of US$10,000.00
is borne out by the fact that both remittances have the same reference invoice
number which is 263 80.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits
“A-1-Deposition of Mr. Stanley <span class="SpellE">Panasow</span>" and
"A-2-Deposition of Mr. Stanley <span class="SpellE">Panasow</span>").</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiff-appellant made the second remittance on the wrong
assumption that defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not receive
the first remittance of US$10,000<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.00 </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 26-27.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that the claim of petitioner is anchored on the
appreciation of the attendant facts which petitioner would have this Court
review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court holds that the finding
by the Court of Appeals that the second $10,000.00 remittance was made by
mistake, being based on substantial evidence, is final and conclusive.</p>
