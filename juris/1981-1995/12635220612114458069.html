The question in this case is whether a petition for allowance of wills and to annul a partition, approved in an <em>intestate </em>proceeding by <em>Branch 20</em> of the Manila Court of First Instance, can be entertained by its <em>Branch 38 </em>(after a probate in the Utah district court).
<p>
<em>Antecedents</em>.- Edward M. Grimm, an American resident of Manila, 
died at 78 in the Makati Medical Center on November 27, 1977.  He was 
survived by his second wife, Maxine Tate Grimm, and their two children, 
named Edward Miller Grimm II (Pete) and Linda Grimm, and by Juanita 
Grimm Morris and Ethel Grimm Roberts (McFadden), his two children by a 
first marriage which ended in divorce (Sub-annexes A and B, pp. 36-47, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
He executed on January 23, 1959 <em>two wills </em>in San Francisco, 
California.  One will disposed of his Philippine estate which he 
described as conjugal property of himself and his second wife.  The 
second will disposed of his estate outside the Philippines.
</p><p>
In both wills, the second wife and two children were favored.  The two children of the <em>first marriage</em>
 were given their legitimes in the will disposing of the estate situated
 in this country.  In the will dealing with his property outside this 
country, the testator said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I purposely have made no provision in this will for my daughter, 
Juanita Grimm Morris, or my daughter, Elsa Grimm McFadden (Ethel Grimm 
Roberts), because I have provided for each of them in a separate will 
disposing of my Philippine property." (First clause, pp. 43-47, <em>Rollo</em>).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The two wills and a codicil were presented for probate by Maxine Tate 
Grimm and E. LaVar Tate on March 7, 1978 in Probate No. 3720 of the 
Third Judicial District Court of Tooele County, Utah.  Juanita Grimm 
Morris of Cupertino, California and Mrs. Roberts of 15 C. Benitez 
Street, Horseshoe Village, Quezon City were notified of the probate 
proceeding (Sub-Annex C, pp. 48-55, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
Maxine admitted that she received notice of the <em>intestate petition </em>filed in Manila by Ethel in January, 1978 (p. 53, <em>Rollo</em>).  In its order dated April 10, 1978, the Third Judicial District Court admitted <em>to probate </em>the
 two wills and the codicil.  It was issued upon consideration of the 
stipulation dated April 4, 1978 "by and between the attorneys for Maxine
 Tate Grimm, Linda Grimm, Edward Miller Grimm II, E. LaVar Tate, Juanita
 Kegley Grimm (first wife), Juanita Grimm Morris and Ethel Grimm 
Roberts" (Annex C, pp. 48-51, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
<em>Two weeks later</em>, or on April 25, 1978, Maxine and her two 
children Linda and Pete as the first parties, and Ethel, Juanita Grimm 
Morris and their mother Juanita Kegley Grimm, as the second parties,<em> with knowledge of the intestate proceeding in Manila</em>, entered into a<em> compromise agreement </em>in
 Utah regarding the estate.  It was signed by David E. Salisbury and 
Donald B. Holbrook, as lawyers of the parties, by Pete and Linda and the
 attorney-in-fact of Maxine and by the attorney-in-fact of Ethel, 
Juanita Grimm Morris and Juanita Kegley Grimm.
</p><p>
In that agreement, it was stipulated that Maxine, Pete and Ethel would 
be designated as personal representatives (administrators) of Grimm's 
Philippine estate (par. 2).  It was also stipulated that Maxine's 
one-half conjugal share in the estate should be reserved for her and 
that would not be less than $1,500,000 plus the homes in Utah and Santa 
Mesa, Manila (par. 4).  The agreement indicated the computation of the 
"net distributable estate".  It recognized that the estate was liable to
 pay the fees of the Angara law firm (par. 5).
</p><p>
It was stipulated in paragraph 6 that the decedent's four children 
"shall share equally in the Net Distributable Estate" and that Ethel and
 Juanita Morris should each receive at least 12-1/2% of the total of the
 net distributable estate and marital share.  A supplemental memorandum 
also dated April 25, 1978 was executed by the parties (Sub-Annex F, pp. 
49-61, Annex F-1, pp. 75-76, Testate case).
</p><p>
<em>Intestate proceeding No. 113024</em>.- At this juncture, it should 
be stated that forty-three days after Grimm's death, or January 9, 1978,
 his daughter of the first marriage, Ethel, 49, through lawyers 
Deogracias T. Reyes and Gerardo B. Macaraeg, filed with Branch 20 of the
 Manila Court of First Instance <em>intestate proceeding No. 113024</em> for the settlement of his estate.  She was named special administratrix.
</p><p>
On March 11, the second wife, Maxine, through the Angara law office, filed an <em>opposition and motion to dismiss the intestate proceeding</em>
 on the ground of the pendency in Utah of a proceeding for the probate 
of Grimm's will.  She also moved that she be appointed special 
administratrix.  She submitted to the court a copy of Grimm's will 
disposing of his Philippine estate.  It is found in pages 58 to 64 of 
the record.
</p><p>
The intestate court in its orders of May 23 and June 2 noted that 
Maxine, through a new lawyer, William C. Limqueco (partner of Gerardo B.
 Macaraeg, p. 78, testate case), withdrew that opposition and motion to 
dismiss and, at the behest of Maxine, Ethel and Pete, appointed them 
joint administrators.  Apparently, this was done pursuant to the 
aforementioned Utah compromise agreement.  <em>The court ignored the will already found in the record.</em>
</p><p>
The three administrators submitted an inventory.  With the authority and
 approval of the court, they sold for P75,000 on March 21, 1979 the 
so-called Palawan Pearl Project, a business owned by the deceased.  
Linda and Juanita allegedly conformed with the sale (pp. 120-129, 
Record).  It turned out that the buyer, Makiling Management Co., Inc., 
was incorporated by Ethel and her husband, Rex Roberts, and by lawyer 
Limqueco (Annex L, p. 90, testate case).
</p><p>
Also with the court's approval and the consent of Linda and Juanita, 
they sold for P1,546,136 to Joseph Server and others 193,267 shares of 
RFM Corporation (p. 135, Record).
</p><p>
Acting on the declaration of heirs and project of partition signed and 
filed by lawyers Limqueco and Macaraeg (not signed by Maxine and her two
 children), Judge Conrado M. Molina in his order of July 27, 1979 
adjudicated to Maxine one-half (4/8) of the decedent's Philippine estate
 and one-eight (1/8) each to his four children or 12-1/2% (pp. 140-142, 
Record).  No mention at all was made of the will in that order.
</p><p>
Six days later, or on August 2, Maxine and her two children <em>replaced Limqueco with Octavio del Callar as their lawyer</em>,
 who on August 9, moved to defer approval of the project of partition.  
The court considered the motion moot considering that it had already 
approved the declaration of heirs and project of partition (p. 149, 
Record).
</p><p>
Lawyer Limqueco in a letter to Maxine dated August 2, 1979 alleged that 
he was no longer connected with Makiling Management Co., Inc. when the 
Palawan Pearl Project was sold; that it was Maxine's son Pete who 
negotiated the sale with Rex Roberts and that he (Limqueco) was going to
 sue Maxine for the lies she imputed to him (Annex H, p. 78, testate 
case).
</p><p>
Ethel submitted to the court a certification of the Assistant 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue dated October 2, 1979.  It was stated 
therein that Maxine paid P1,992,233.69 as estate tax and penalties and 
that he interposed no objection to the transfer of the estate to Grimm's
 heirs (p. 153, Record).  The court noted the certification as in 
conformity with its order of July 27, 1979.
</p><p>
After November, 1979 or for a <em>period of more than five months,</em> 
there was no movement or activity in the intestate case.  On April 18, 
1980 Juanita Grimm Morris, through Ethel's lawyers, filed a motion for 
accounting "so that the Estate properties can be partitioned among the 
heirs and the present intestate estate be closed".  Del Callar, Maxine's
 lawyer was notified of that motion.
</p><p>
Before that motion could be heard, or on June 10, 1980, the Angara law 
firm filed again its appearance in collaboration with Del Callar as 
counsel for Maxine and her two children, Linda and Pete.  It should be 
recalled that the firm had previously appeared in the case as Maxine's 
counsel on March 11, 1978, when it filed a motion to dismiss the 
intestate proceeding and furnished the court with a copy of Grimm's 
will.  As already noted, the firm was then superseded by lawyer 
Limqueco.
</p><p>
<em>Petition to annul partition and testate proceeding No. 134559.</em>-
 On September 8, 1980, Rogelio A. Vinluan of the Angara law firm, in 
behalf of Maxine, Pete and Linda, filed in Branch 38 of the lower court a
 petition praying for the probate of Grimm's two wills (already probated
 in Utah), that the 1979 partition approved by the intestate court be 
set aside and the letters of administration revoked, that Maxine be 
appointed executrix and that Ethel and Juanita Morris be ordered to 
account for the properties received by them and to return the same to 
Maxine (pp. 25-35, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
Grimm's second wife and two children alleged that they were defrauded 
due to the machinations of the Roberts spouses, that the 1978 Utah 
compromise agreement was illegal, that the intestate proceeding is void 
because Grimm died testate and that the partition was contrary to the 
decedent's wills.
</p><p>
Ethel filed a motion to dismiss the petition.  Judge Leonidas denied it 
for lack of merit in his order of October 27, 1980.  Ethel then filed a 
petition for <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition in this Court, praying 
that the testate proceeding be dismissed, or, alternatively, that the 
two proceedings be consolidated and heard in <em>Branch 20</em> and that the matter of the annulment of the Utah compromise agreement be heard prior to the petition for probate (pp. 22-23, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
<em>Ruling</em>.- We hold that respondent judge did not commit any grave
 abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, in denying 
Ethel's motion to dismiss.
</p><p>
A testate proceeding is proper in this case because Grimm died with two 
wills and "no will shall pass either real or personal property unless it
 is proved and allowed" (Art. 838, Civil Code; sec. 1, Rule 75, Rules of
 Court).
</p><p>
The probate of the will is mandatory (Guevara vs. Guevara, 74 Phil. 479 
and 98 Phil. 249; Baluyot vs. Paño, L-42088, May 7, 1976, 71 SCRA 86).  
It is anomalous that the estate of a person who died <em>testate </em>should be settled in an <em>intestate</em>
 proceeding.  Therefore, the intestate case should be consolidated with 
the testate proceeding and the judge assigned to the testate proceeding 
should continue hearing the two cases.
</p><p>
Ethel may file within twenty days from notice of the finality of this 
judgment an opposition and answer to the petition unless she considers 
her motion to dismiss and other pleadings sufficient for the purpose.  
Juanita G. Morris, who appeared in the intestate case, should be served 
with copies of orders, notices and other papers in the testate case.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is dismissed.  The temporary restraining order is dissolved.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Guerrero,</em> and <em>De Castro, JJ., </em>concur.
</p><p>
<em>Escolin, J.</em>, in the result.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr.</em> and A<em>bad Santos, JJ., </em>no part.
