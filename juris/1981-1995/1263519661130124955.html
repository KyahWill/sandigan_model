				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">VICENTE PACUDAN was accused of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">murder </span>in the defunct Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>. The information <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">against </span>him reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 1st day of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">October, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">1980, at about 3 o'clock p.m., in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused,
armed with a revolver, with deliberate intent, with intent to kill, with
treachery and evident </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">premeditation </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">did then and
there attack, assault and use personal violence upon one Ricardo B. <span class="SpellE">Varon</span>, by firing of several shots at him (deceased) on
different vital parts of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his (deceased)
body, thereby </span>inflicting upon him the following injuries:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'GUNSHOT WOUNDS, MULTIPLE, HEAD &amp; RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY",</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">as</span> a consequence
of which said Ricardo B. <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> died
instantaneously." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>,
p. 1.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the trial court states:</p>

<blockquote>"Before arraignment, counsel for the accused moved that the
accused be allowed to plead guilty to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">lesser </span>offense of homicide. Since the prosecution vigorously
opposed the motion, the court denied the offer to plead guilty to homicide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, when arraigned in accordance with law, the accused,
assisted by counsel of his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">c</span>hoice,
entered the plea of not guilty to the information for murder." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>, pp. 74-75.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial wherein the only witness for the defense was the accused,
the court rendered the following judgment:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pacudan</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
MURDER described in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> information. While
we consider abuse of superiority or the fact that means were employed by the
accused to weaken the defense, we take into account the relatively tender age
of the accused and, thus, we hold that the accused should be, as he is, hereby
sentenced to the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, with
the accessory penalties of the law; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> by way of compensatory and actual
damages in the sum of P12,000.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">00</span>
and by way of moral and exemplary damages in the sum of P25,000.00, without
subsidiary <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">imprisonment </span>in case
of insolvency; and to pay the costs." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>, p. 82.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant admits having shot and killed Ricardo B. <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> who <span class="GramE">was a fellow security guard</span>
assigned by the Sentinel Security <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Agency
to the Pacific Banking Corporation in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City. He
claims, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">however, that it was <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">done in self-defense.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The following narration
is taken from the appellants brief:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At about three o'clock p.m., the appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pacudan</span>, a security guard then on duty at the main door of
the Pacific Banking Corporation branch in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, was called
by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Varon</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">another security guard, to the security office on the third floor of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">building. After calling another guard to take his place, <span class="SpellE">Pacudan</span> went up to the office where <span class="SpellE">Varon</span>
was waiting for him. <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> immediately berated <span class="SpellE">Pacudan</span> for reporting him to the security officer, Daniel <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, for his misdeeds, calling him a bootlicker, and saying
"I will kill you." <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> then grabbed the
.38 caliber pistol in a holster at <span class="SpellE">Pacudan's</span> waist. They
grappled for the gun </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fell, and went off. Then <span class="SpellE">Pacudan</span>
butted </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Varon</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">his head as <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> tried to grab the gun, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and once he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">had it in his hand, the gun was fired at </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">least more </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">than two
times.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Pacudan</span> then went down and
surrendered the gun to the security guard below, and this guard kept the gun in
the drawer. <span class="SpellE">Pacudan</span> then surrendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to </span>the Philippine Constabulary
officer." <span class="GramE">(Brief, p. 2.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether under the facts supplied by the appellant
himself he acted in self-defense. We hold that he did not.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In </span>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Talaboc</span>, Jr. L-25004, Oct. 31, 1969, 30 SCRA 87, this Court
held that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in self-defense </span>the
burden of proof rests upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the accused.
His duty is to establish <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">self-defense
by </span>clear and convincing evidence. Having admitted the killing <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of the deceased but </span>failing to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">present </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">sufficient evidence to establish self-defense, the accused must be
convicted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, the
claim of self-<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">defense is </span>negated
by the following observations of the trial court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Significant in his answers to questions on cross-examination
is the allegation that, when <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> threatened to kill
him, he admittedly had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">no reason to
fear such a threat because <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> had no gun. It was
he who was armed instead with his service revolver.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The gun of the accused was placed in his holster and it was
safely put in place by a strap with snap buttons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The holster was hooked to defendant's belt and,
notwithstanding the force exerted by the <span class="GramE">protagonists,</span>
neither the trousers nor the belt was destroyed. This casts grave doubt as to
the version of the accused, thus leading <span class="GramE">Us</span> to
conclude that the shooting was deliberate and not perpetrated because of
self-defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While the gun in its holster was tucked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to </span>the right waist of the accused and
the protagonists were facing each other, it was easy for the accused to prevent
the taking. Yet, his mind <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">again
becoming </span>blank at this point, the accused neither saw how <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>deceased relieved him of his gun
nor did he see the hand of the deceased that reached out to take it. He claims
that he did not point his gun at <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> because he did
not want to kill the latter; yet, when asked as to why he fired the gun at all,
he answered that it was a matter of life and death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The foregoing evidence considered, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find the main issue to be, whether or not the accused shot the deceased <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> in self-defense. A threshold question would be
whether the deceased truly grabbed the service firearm of the accused and tried
to kill the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We find the allegation of the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span>this
regard to be fallacious because it is inconceivable. The deceased <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> was admittedly unarmed. The accused, on the other
hand, was fittingly possessed of his service firearm. It would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">be </span>preposterous to assume that the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Varon</span> would threaten to kill the accused in
this situation and try to grab the service firearm of the accused, considering
that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> gun was locked to its holster and,
while the protagonists were face to face, the accused could effectively prevent
the taking and easily get hold of the gun ahead of the deceased. It is a conclusion
conceived in logic and our experience of the affairs of mankind that an unarmed
person will not ordinarily try to kill another who is armed with a gun by
grabbing for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">gun </span>by the skin <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of his <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">teeth, so to </span>speak, so as to kill his
opponent with <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span>opponent's
gun. A person may not have the temerity to attack a man <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">with a </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">gun</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.</span>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">pp. 79-80.)</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The next relevant question is: what is the proper denomination
for the crime, murder or homicide only? The information alleges two qualifying
circumstances neither of which had been proved. There was no treachery because
the adversaries were face to face. There was no <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">evident </span>premeditation because there is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">no</span> proof that the accused had planned the killing. And contrary to
the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> there was not even abuse of superiority
because it was a one </span>on one, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">face
to face confrontation and no means </span>were employed to weaken the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">defense. The crime committed was homicide not
murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant admittedly surrendered voluntarily after the
killing. He is entitled to this mitigating circumstance which calls for the
application of the minimum period of the appropriate penalty.</p>
