				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Our Resolution of 14 August 1992, We directed ATTY. BENJAMIN
M. DACANAY, counsel for petitioner Adez Realty, Inc., to "<i>SHOW</i> <i>CAUSE</i>
within five (5) days from notice why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with
for intercalating a material fact in the judgment of the court <i>a quo</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
thereby altering and modifying its factual findings with the apparent purpose
of misleading this Court in order to obtain a favorable judgment, and thus
failing to live up to the standards expected of a member of the Bar."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his EXPLANATION of 1 September 1992, Atty. Benjamin M. Dacanay
"humbly prostrates himself before the Honorable Court and throws himself
at its mercy," and explains that -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x whenever he prepares petitions either for the Court of
Appeals or the Supreme Court, he dictates to his secretary and if portions of
the decision or order to be appealed from have to be quoted, he simply
instructs his said secretary to copy the particular pages of the said decision
or order.<span style="font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the case at bar, he did instruct his secretary to copy the
corresponding pages in the decision of the Court of Appeals.  Somehow, however, some words were
intercalated on a particular paragraph noted by the Honorable Court he
regrettably is at a loss to explain.  He
remembers, however, that at the time he was preparing the petition at bar there
were other pleadings necessitating equal if not preferential attention from him
which could perhaps be the reason why his secretary committed a very grievous mistake.  Such mistake though he does not condone and
he feels upset at the turn of events.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Attached to his EXPLANATION as Annex "A" is an
Affidavit<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of Alicia A. Castro, purportedly his Secretary, stating among others that -</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>x x x in the preparation of the petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i> filed with the Supreme Court, it was Atty. Benjamin
M. Dacanay who dictated to me the contents of said petition;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>x x x in the preparation of the petition, he
told me, as he is wont to do whenever he prepares a petition, to copy the
particular pages in the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No.
23773 entitled ‘Adez Realty, Inc., petitioner versus The Hon. Judge of the
Regional Trial Court of Morong, Rizal, Branch 79 (not 89 as stated in the
Affidavit), et al., respondents;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>x x x when I copied the particular pages of
the decision of the Court of Appeals as instructed by Atty. Benjamin M.
Dacanay, I did as instructed, but it was only after our office received the
copy of the decision of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 100643 x x x that Atty.
Dacanay confronted me and asked me where I got that portion which was added to
the particular paragraph noted by the Supreme Court; that it was only then that
I realized the mistake I committed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>x x x I surmise that the error could have been
due to the fact that ADEZ REALTY, Inc. has so many cases being handled by the
law office that I presume I could have copied or my intention was distracted by
other pleadings atop my table at the time.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the EXPLANATION of counsel, the First Division
referred his case <i>en consulta</i> to the Court <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">En Banc</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>which
accepted and took cognizance of it in view of the possible sanction that may be
imposed on a member of the Bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due deliberation, the Court <i>En Banc</i> brushed off as
simply unsatisfactory and incredible counsel’s explanation that it was his
secretary who committed the mistake.  This "passing-the-buck" stance of counsel was already aptly
treated in <i>Adaza v. Barinaga,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> where
the Court observed thus -<span style="font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Making the law office secretary, clerk or messenger the
scapegoat or patsy for the delay in the filing of pleadings, motions and other
papers and for the lawyer's dereliction of duty is a common alibi of practising
lawyers.  Like the alibi of the accused
in criminal cases, counsel's shifting of the blame to his office employee is
usually a concoction utilized to cover up his own negligence, incompetence,
indolence and ineptitude."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case of petitioner is no better; it can be worse.  For, how could the secretary have divined
the phrase <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"<i>without notice </i></span><i>to
</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the actual occupants of the </span>property,
</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Adez Realty</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">," </span>without counsel dictating it
word for word?  Could it have been a
providential mistake of the secretary as it was very material, and on which
could have hinged the fate of a litigant's cause?  Whatever be the truth in this regard, counsel cannot elude
administrative responsibility which borders on falsification of a judicial
record to which, by his inveigling, he unfortunately drags his secretary.  Indeed, by no means can he evade
responsibility for the vicious intercalation as he admittedly dictated and
signed the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the bounden duty of lawyers to check, review and recheck
the allegations in their pleadings, more particularly the quoted portions, and
ensure that the statements therein are accurate and the reproductions faithful,
down to the last word and even punctuation mark.  The legal profession demands that lawyers thoroughly go over
pleadings, motions and other documents dictated or prepared by them, typed or
transcribed by their secretaries or clerks, before filing them with the
court.  If a client is bound by the acts
of his counsel, with more reason should counsel be bound by the acts of his
secretary who merely follows his orders.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case originated from a petition for reconstitution of
title over a parcel of land.  Section 13
of R.A. 26, in relation to Sec. 12 of the same statute, on which petitioner
bases one of his causes of action, provides among others that notice should be
given to the occupants or persons in possession of the property.  Compliance therewith is a material
requirement for granting a petition for reconstitution of title.  The inserted phrase "without notice to
the actual occupants of the property, Adez Realty," was just the right
phrase intercalated at the right place, making it highly improbable to be
unintentionally, much less innocently, committed; and by the secretary at
that.  All circumstances herein simply
but strongly sustain Our belief.  Certainly, making it appear that respondent Court of Appeals found that
no notice was given to the occupants of subject property - when in fact it did
not make such a finding - is a clear indication not merely of carelessness in
lifting a portion of the assailed decision but a malicious attempt to gain
undue advantage in the sporting arena of fairplay and, more importantly, to
deceive and misguide this Court, which is the final arbiter of litigations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well-entrenched in our jurisprudence is the rule that, save in
certain instances, factual findings of the Court of Appeals are binding upon
this Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The distortion of facts committed by counsel, with the willing assistance of
his secretary, is a grave <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">offense </span>and
should not be treated lightly, not only because it may set a dangerous
precedent but, rather, because it is a clear and serious violation of one's
oath as a Member of the Bar, Rule 10.02, Canon 10, Chapter III, of the Code of
Professional Responsibility directs that "[<u>a] lawyer shall not
knowingly misquote or misrepresent</u> the contents of a paper, the language or
the argument of opposing counsel, <u>or the text of a decision</u> or
authority, or knowingly cite as a law a provision already rendered inoperative
by repeal or amendment, or assert as a fact that which has not been
proved" (underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Misquoting or intercalating phrases in the text of a court
decision constitutes willful disregard of the lawyer's solemn duty to act at
all times in a manner consistent with the truth.  A lawyer should never venture to mislead the court by false
statements or quotations of facts or laws.  Thus, in <i>Bautista v. Gonzales,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> We
suspended respondent for six (6) months for, among others, submitting to the
lower court falsified documents, representing them to be true <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">copies.  In </span><i>Chavez v. Viola,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> We
suspended respondent counsel for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">five </span>(5)
months after he filed an Amended Application for Original Registration of Title
which contained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">false </span>statements.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.2in">The case at bar, although akin to the
aforementioned cases, has more serious and far-reaching repercussions.  Those who attempt to misguide this Court,
the last forum for appeal, should be dealt with more severely lest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We </span>be made unwilling instruments of
inequity and injustice.  Indeed, counsel
has demonstrated his wanton disregard for truth and fairplay even before the
Highest Court of the land.  Worse, he
compounded his unprofessional mischief by<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">
</span>laying the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>blame on his
hapless secretary whose duty it was simply to obey him.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well to repeat, perhaps to the point of satiety, what W<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">e </span>have already said -</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">“x x x </span>that the
practice of law is not a right but a privilege bestowed by the State on those
who show that they possess, and continue to possess, the qualifications
required by law for the conferment of such privilege.  One of those requirements is the observance of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">honesty and </span>candor.  It cannot be gainsaid that candidness,
especially towards the courts, is essential <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
