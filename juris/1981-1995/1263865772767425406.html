				<H3>HUA BEE SHIRT FACTORY AND/OR CHAN MAN LIN, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC) (FIRST DIVISION) AND CELIA OCAMPO, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition seeks to set aside the decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="10">October 16,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>1987</st1:date>
which is alleged to have been issued with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>the NLRC reversed the decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of the </span>Labor Arbiter dated <st1:date year="1985" day="30" month="5">Ma<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">y 30, </span>1985</st1:date>
which dismissed private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">respondent's </span>complaint
for illegal dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that private respondent Celia <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> was employed as high speed sewer of petitioners <span class="GramE">on</span> a piece work basis in 1978 up to her alleged illegal
dismissal on <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her position paper submitted before the
Labor Arbiter, she alleged that petitioner suspected her of leading in the
formation of a union in the company which caused her outright dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, however, contends that respondent
was not dismissed from work but following their disagreement in the charge of
piece rate scale, she refused to report for work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter, in his decision, stated that during the <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1985</st1:date> hearing, the company, thru
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, categorically informed complainant <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> that she was never dismissed from her work, and she
was informed that the company needs her services and she can report for work
anytime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
however, categorically turned down the offer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further, complainant was allegedly guilty of abandonment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was therefore dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by respondent <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> to
respondent NLRC, the latter reversed the labor arbiter's decision, ruling in
part:</p>

<p class="2Q">"After a careful consideration of allegations and arguments
advanced by the parties, we disagree with the assailed decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's alleged refusal to report back <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">for </span>work while being offered
reinstatement by respondent can not be equated as abandonment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is believed that the offer was not
strongly enforced or could it be an offer without manifest good faith on the
part of respondent that reinstatement did not materialize.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule that abandonment
requires deliberate unjustified refusal to resume employment or a clear showing
that the worker does not clearly intend to report for work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The immediate and vigorous objection to her
dismissal as shown by the filing of the complaint two (2) days after <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">her alleged </span>dismissal negates any
color of abandonment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Flexo</span> Mfg. Corp. vs. NLRC, 135 SCRA 145) At any rate,
considering respondent is willing to re-employ complainants, it is believed to
be the most reasonable and equitable solution to the issue at bar, with payment
of six (6) months <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> computed at the prevailing
statutory rate there being no record of her average daily wage." (p. 2,
NLRC Dec.; p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sole issue is whether the award of six
months <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> is proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answer is in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Had private respondent really abandoned her work, petitioners
should have charged her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with </span>abandonment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, it appearing that the case for
illegal dismissal was filed on <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="10">October
 17, 1984</st1:date> or two days after her dismissal, this fact negates
petitioner's allegation that she did not report for work due to the new piece
rates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Besides
abandonment by the private respondent was never proved by petitioners.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged refusal of private respondent to report for work at
the hearing on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1985</st1:date>,
is not substantiated by the records of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No hearing was held on that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the parties were there, the
resetting of the hearing was the only action made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The labor arbiter's conclusion was merely
based on the position papers submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise for failure of petitioners to serve notice of dismissal
on private respondent, <span class="GramE">We</span> consider the same as
constituting illegal dismissal, a ground for an employee to be entitled to
receive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his </span><span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b><span class="GramE">,</span> the petition
is hereby DISMISSED for lack of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
