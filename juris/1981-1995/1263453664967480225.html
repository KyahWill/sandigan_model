<blockquote>&quot;Milagros Areola, the complainant herein, had her first
assignment as a public school teacher at Barrio San Juan, <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Cagayan</span> (p. 25, <span class=SpellE>t.s.n</span>.,
Jan. 7, 1974, morning session).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Being
her first time to go to barrio <st1:City><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:City>,
she, accompanied by her mother and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anso</span>, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Viloria</span> and Maria Alonzo, went to the said barrio on <st1:date
Year="1973" Day="20" Month="6">June 20, 1973</st1:date> before assuming her
position to orient herself of the place and to look for a suitable boarding
house (id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The nearest house to the
barrio school where she was to teach was the house of Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Miling</span>
Bermudez about 100 meters away (p. 26, id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were only two houses near the school, the other one being the
house of the accused, Reynaldo de la Cruz, which was about 40 meters away from
the house of Mrs. Bermudez (id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of
these two houses, the group chose the house of Mrs. Bermudez, aunt of Reynaldo,
as the boarding house of Milagros Areola (pp. 26-27, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Milagros reported to school for the first time on <st1:date
Year="1973" Day="21" Month="6">June 21, 1973</st1:date> (p. 27, id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On that same day, Mrs. Bermudez introduced to
her the accused (her nephew) and his parents and sisters (pp. 27-28, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;In the afternoon of <st1:date Year="1973" Day="22" Month="6">June
 22, 1973</st1:date>, Milagros, accompanied by <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span>
de la Cruz (Reynaldo's younger sister), went back to the Centro of <span
class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span> to get her school supplies, to submit her
report of enrollment, and to procure her basic needs (p. 28, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;On <st1:date Year="1973" Day="24" Month="6">June 24, 1973</st1:date>,
Milagros and <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span> went to market and while they
were there, <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span> saw her brother Reynaldo and
asked him to go with her and Milagros (pp. 29-30, id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In keeping with <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>Filipino courtesy and hospitality, Milagros requested </span><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'> to invite Reynaldo to take his lunch at her
(Milagros) parent's house in Centro, <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span> (p.
18, 30, id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although Reynaldo obliged
by going to the house of Milagros, he, however, did not eat his lunch there
because he left while Milagros was preparing lunch (id.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;After lunch, Milagros and <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span>
went to the market to wait for a ride to <span class=SpellE>Nararagan</span> on
their way to <st1:City><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While waiting for a ride, Milagros saw
Virgie, her <span class=SpellE>boardmate</span>, and the mother of Reynaldo
(id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They told her that they had not
eaten their lunch yet (id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros
invited them to her house but they declined (id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros then invited them for snack in the
market and there they ate halo-halo and cake (p. 31, id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After taking half of her halo-halo, Milagros
went to pay the refreshment parlor owner about five meters away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon her return to the table, her companions
told her to eat her halo-<span class=GramE>halo,</span> otherwise, they will
not also eat theirs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros obliged
and finished her halo-halo, saying, 'I have to eat it, because I have paid for
it.' <span class=GramE>(p. 32, id.).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Thereafter, the group, unable to wait for the <span
class=SpellE>Herminia</span> Transit, hired two tricycles to bring them to <span
class=SpellE>Nararagan</span> (pp. 32-33, id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They arrived in Barrio San Juan between <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="16">4:00</st1:time>
and <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon (p.
33, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Although she had headache and felt dizzy since the night of
June 24 after coming from Centro, Milagros reported for school on <st1:date
Year="1973" Day="25" Month="6">June 25, 1973</st1:date> (pp. 33-34, id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During recess, Reynaldo went to give her
coffee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was surprised because it was
the daughter of her land-lady who used to serve her coffee at recess time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(id.)<span class=GramE>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After</span> drinking her coffee, her
condition became worse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>(p. 35, id.).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;On <st1:date Year="1973" Day="26" Month="6">June 26, 1973</st1:date>,
despite her worsening condition, Milagros continued to go to school.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During recess, Reynaldo was again the one who
brought her coffee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Noticing bubbles in
her coffee, Milagros became suspicious and asked Reynaldo why there were
bubbles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The latter explained that the
water was boiling when he poured it on the coffee (id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After drinking the coffee, she felt her body
becoming heavier (id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;On <st1:date Year="1973" Day="27" Month="6">June 27, 1973</st1:date>,
Milagros again went to school, this time, with much difficulty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like the previous days, Reynaldo again
brought her coffee during recess (pp. 35-36, id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unable to endure her condition any longer,
Milagros went home at <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning before the regular dis­missal time (p. 36, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Upon arrival at her boarding house, Milagros changed her
clothes, ate a light lunch and, after telling Virgie, Delia and Myrna, her
companions in the house, not to make any noise because she wanted to rest, she
went to bed (pp. 36-37, id.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While
resting, she noticed someone entered her room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Thinking that it was one of her housemates, she paid no heed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then she heard someone asked her if she had
already eaten her lunch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Noticing that
the person who made the inquiry was Reynaldo, Milagros requested him to go out
of the room be­cause she was sickly and she wanted to rest (p. 37, id.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>When she was about to catch
her sleep, Rey­naldo, without a shirt on, suddenly went on top of her.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She struggled against and wrestled with Rey­naldo,
pleading to him to desist from doing what he intended to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She shouted for help but nobody went to her
succor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With her state of health - ­feeling
very weak and dizzy -- Milagros was easily overpowered by Reynaldo who
succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her (pp. 37-39, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;In the afternoon, Reynaldo threatened and forced Milagros to
go with him to his house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her will
overpowered by the intake of drugs administered to her by the accused,
Milagros, acting like a robot, followed the wishes and orders of Reynaldo (Q
&amp; A, No. 16, <span class=SpellE>Exh</span>. B).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her helplessness became greater when, upon
reporting the incident to her landlord, she received the following advice, 'If
I were you, Ma'am, I would follow him because something wrong might happened
(sic) to you if you do not follow him and his wishes.' Still deprived of
reason, coupled with the threats and intimidation of Reynaldo and her
helplessness, Milagros went with the accused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Reynaldo, through the use of force, succeeded in having other sexual intercourses
with Milagros who was still weak and deprived of her mental faculties because
of the drugs previously administered to her (pp. 41-42, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;In the evening of June 28, 1973, Milagros saw the barrio
captain and told him that Reynaldo forced her to follow him under threats and
intimi­dation, to which the barrio captain answered, 'Do not think of that
anymore my daughter, what you should think is how you would settle down.' <span
class=GramE>(p. 42, id.).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;On <st1:date Year="1973" Day="29" Month="6">June 29, 1973</st1:date>,
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anso</span> and a policeman fetched Milagros from the
house of Reynaldo and brought her to the District Supervisor's Office where her
mother and the Supervisor were waiting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She related to her mother and to the Supervisor her harrowing
experience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She told them that she was
ravished by the accused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The accused does not deny
having had sexual intercourse with the complainant on June 27 and 28,
1973.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He however insists that the same
were consummated not only with the consent of the complainant but upon her own
initiative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His version of the facts is
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The accused and the
complainant came to know of each other </span>when he went to the school where
the complainant was teaching and helped the latter sweep the classroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He did not know the date as he was
illiterate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After they had swept the
floor and arranged the chairs, the complainant sat beside him and asked him of
his real name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He gave his name as
&quot;Reynaldo de la Cruz&quot; and in turn asked the complainant of her
name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The complainant answered:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I am called Mila at home, and I am
called Milagros Areola here in school.&quot; After that short conversation, he
went home.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>At noontime of the same
day, Reynaldo saw Milagros at her boarding house which was near his house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was then sitting beside the stairs when
Milagros also saw him and waved her hands at him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He then went to her boarding house where she
offered him a cup of coffee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At first he
refused to drink the coffee but he drank it nevertheless because Milagros
said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Since this is my first time
to offer you, why do you displease me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The next time Reynaldo saw
Milagros was when the former was walking in their yard while the latter was
peeling a pineapple </span>in the kitchen of her boarding house.<span

her hands at him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros then invited
Reynaldo to share the pineapple.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shortly
after they had eaten the pineapple, the landlady of Milagros prepared the
table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros refused to eat if she
could not invite Reynaldo to eat with her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Milagros then poured soup on a plate of rice and mixed it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said to Reynaldo:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Let us see if you can eat this mixed
rice and soup I prepared.&quot; She then took a spoonful of the mixture and fed
it to Reynaldo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

and soup and fed it to Milagros, saying:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;If you really care for me, then try also eating the same kind of
food that you gave me.&quot; The owners of the boarding house who were in front
of them commented that they were like a <span class=SpellE>newlywedded</span>
couple.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And to such comment Milagros
responded:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Would there be anything
wrong, brother and sister, if I can be pitted against Boy?&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>The following day, Milagros again called for Reynaldo to ask for
the latter's permission for his younger sister, <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span>,
to accompany her to <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reynaldo replied that while he was the eldest
in the family, they still had their parents so it would be better for Milagros
to get the permission from their parents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Milagros agreed to get the permission from the parents of Reynaldo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then requested Reynaldo to accompany them
to <span class=SpellE>Nararagan</span> where they could get a ride for <span
class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>On their way to <span class=SpellE>Nararagan</span> Milagros asked
Reynaldo:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Why, Boy, are you not
still going to marry?&quot;</span> Reynaldo replied:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I am very eager Ma'am, but nobody would
like me because I am so <span class=SpellE>wardly</span> and I am difficult in
life.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros said:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;It is only because you do not want
it.&quot; Reynaldo then commented:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;If I could only be pitted against you, then it would be very
good.&quot; Milagros then told Reynaldo to go to <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span>
the coming Sunday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Reynaldo replied:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I will come, Ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>It was still dark when Reynaldo started from their house in going
to <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Upon reaching <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span>, he stayed in front
of the plaza where Milagros and his sister, <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span>,
saw him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros invited them to eat
their lunch in her house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>He agreed but not before Milagros assured him
that she had no sisters in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Milagros' mother and grandparents were in their house when they
arrived.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros told Reynaldo to wait
in the <span class=SpellE>sala</span> while she cooked their lunch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But when Milagros was about to finish
cooking, her sisters arrived.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since
Reynaldo felt uncomfortable, he begged to be excused.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros allowed him to leave when he
promised that he would return for lunch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But Reynaldo did not return; instead he went to a restaurant where he
was invited by some male teachers for a drinking spree.</p>

<p class=BODY>Sometime thereafter, Reynaldo's sister, <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span>,
arrived and told him:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Come now, <span
class=SpellE>Manong</span>, said <span class=SpellE>Manang</span> Mila.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She did not even take her lunch because you
were not there.&quot; Reynaldo answered:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Just go ahead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could not
now come along with you because I am already drunk.&quot; <span class=SpellE>Herminia</span>
then left and went to the tricycle where Milagros was waiting.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Shortly thereafter,
Reynaldo's mother arrived and told him:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;You come at all costs, because she would not like to come and
teach if you do not come with me now.&quot; Reynaldo replied:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You go ahead and I will follow.&quot; A
barrio councilman then pushed Reynaldo so the latter was forced to follow his
mother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They went to the parking place
for trucks and there they met Milagros who invited them to a place where she
ordered &quot;halo-halo&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>After they had eaten
their &quot;halo-halo&quot;, Milagros hired a tricycle where she, Reynaldo and <span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon reaching <span class=SpellE>Nararagan</span>,
Reynaldo unloaded the school supplies and placed them on the sled of his
younger brother who met them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The three
of them then walked home.</p>

<p class=BODY>Upon reaching a muddy portion of the path leading to their
houses, Milagros taunted Reynaldo by saying:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Will you carry me if you could really carry me.&quot; Reynaldo
however refused to carry Milagros saying that he was ashamed because Milagros'
uncle, Alejandro Areola, was then south of them bulldozing.<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh, yes, it is really shameful.&quot;
And they continued walking.</p>

<p class=BODY>When they arrived at the boarding house of Milagros, Reynaldo
asked her to let him see her pictures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Milagros then gave Reynaldo her album.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But when Reynaldo was scanning the album, Milagros grabbed it and
entered the room saying:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;If you
want to see my pictures, come into the room.&quot; Reynaldo entered the room
and sat on a divan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros then gave
him the album.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While Reynaldo was
looking at the pictures, Milagros changed her clothes and sat near
Reynaldo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then told him:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Let us see if you can carry me.&quot; <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Reynaldo accepted the challenge and carried
Milagros.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He then kissed her on the
face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros then said:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You go and see those things that you
placed on the sled and find out if they are wet or not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You will be responsible for them if they are
wet.&quot; Reynaldo ran to meet his younger brother who was pulling the sled
and saw that the articles were not wet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But he ran back to Milagros and told her:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Mila, your belongings are wet.&quot;
Milagros <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>hurriedly went down to see her
things and when she saw that they were not wet, she slapped Reynaldo on the
waist and said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Liar, they are not
wet.&quot; Reynaldo then carried the things upstairs and bade Milagros
goodbye.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros allowed him to go but
shortly, thereafter, she overtook him and gave him her picture with the
following inscription at the back:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;<st1:date Year="1973" Day="26"
Month="6">6-26-73</st1:date></blockquote>

<blockquote>To Boy,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let me know how much you may remember me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sisterly,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mila&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Reynaldo next saw Milagros when he was fetching water and she was
taking a bath.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>That
same day, Milagros, thru Danny Bermudez (the son of her landlord), summoned
Reynaldo to her boarding house and once there requested him to wash her clothes
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>and </span>to press her pant suit.</span></p>

<p class=BODY><span class=GramE>Then came the fateful noon of Wednesday.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reynaldo was sitting on the stairs of his
house when Milagros waved at him from the window of her boarding house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Responding to the call, Reynaldo went to
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros was already crying when
she said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;<span class=SpellE>Tsk</span>,
your smoking is even more precious than I am.&quot; Reynaldo replied:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You have to excuse me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is not easy for me to remove my vice.&quot;
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>He </span>then promised to stop smoking
but when Milagros did not seem <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>to </span>believe
him, he said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;So that I will be
able to prove to you, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>I will </span>throw
away this pack of Marlboro cigarettes in my pocket.&quot; Milagros then invited
him to go inside her room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And after
they entered the room, Milagros spread a mat, lay down and said:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Will you fan me?&quot; Reynaldo was
fanning Milagros when the latter's landlady (an aunt of Reynaldo) entered and
left the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros then said to
Reynaldo:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Come, let us
sleep.&quot; Milagros kissed Reynaldo when the latter lay down beside her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Aroused and emboldened by Milagros'
aggressiveness, Reynaldo likewise kissed her and suggested that they had sexual
intercourse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros asked
Reynaldo:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Will you not forsake
me?&quot; Reynaldo answered: &quot;At any time, I am ready to marry you.&quot;
Milagros then said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Before we do
these things, I am going to tell you one thing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was another man ahead of you and I am telling you so that you will
know.&quot; Reynaldo replied:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;It
is better that you tell me frankly, rather than concealing the same for after
all I will be able to detect it.&quot; Reynaldo then asked Milagros to pull
down her panty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He then went on top of
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After consummating the act,
Reynaldo said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Let us get up and
eat.&quot; And they ate at the kitchen of the boarding house.</p>

<p class=BODY>After eating, Milagros said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I do not want to go and teach anymore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is not easy to be walking there like a
duck.&quot; But Reynaldo dissuaded her from missing her class so she dressed
and went to school while he proceeded home.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the evening of that day, Reynaldo went to the boarding house
of Milagros to ask Milagros' permission to go to <span class=SpellE>Olongapo</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros did not want him to go despite his
assurance that he would stay in <span class=SpellE>Olongapo</span> only for a
short while.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She even got a scissor and
tried to stab herself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reynaldo grabbed
the scissor and pacified Milagros.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
then told her to wait for a while as he was <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>just going to urinate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
Milagros grabbed him by the tail of his shirt and did not let him go.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then got her things and went with
Reynaldo to the latter's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Upon arrival at the house, Reynaldo's mother asked Milagros:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Why did you come, my daughter, we may
be blamed for this.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros
answered:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No, mother, I will be
responsible for <span class=GramE>this,</span> perhaps we are destined for each
other.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Shortly thereafter, the barrio captain (an uncle of Reynaldo),
along with some members of the council, arrived.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The barrio captain told Milagros about the
consequences of her decision to live with Reynaldo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Milagros said:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Never mind, that might have been
already my destiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even my aunties, all
of them got married.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of them was
married to a farmer, and the other is married to a drunkard, how much more with
Boy.&quot; For his part, Reynaldo said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I did not yet want to settle down, Mr. Captain, but because she
was going to kill herself, I could not do anything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have to bring her home already.&quot; The
barrio captain then told Milagros:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;You should know better, ma'am.&quot; The visitors then left and
Reynaldo and Milagros then slept together.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The following morning,
Milagros told Reynaldo:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Let us
have a secret marriage.&quot; Reynaldo asked:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Where?&quot; He then suggested <span class=SpellE>Aparri</span>
but Milagros said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I am afraid in <span
class=SpellE>Aparri</span> because I have an uncle there.&quot; They then
agreed to have their secret marriage in <span class=SpellE>Laoag</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>They were about to leave
for <span class=SpellE>Laoag</span> when Reynaldo's parents told Milagros:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Even if that was the way things have
gone, give </span>us the opportunity to talk with your parents so that they
will not blame us.&quot; On that same morning, Reynaldo's parents went to <span
class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span> to talk to Milagros' parents about the
matter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reynaldo and Milagros put off
their plan to go to <span class=SpellE>Laoag</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, Reynaldo brought Milagros, first, to
the house of his uncle, Jose <span class=SpellE>Beria</span>, and then to the
house of younger brother, Rogelio.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When
the parents of Reynaldo arrived from <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span> they
said they would return to <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span> the following
Saturday and wait for Mila's father before they get married.</p>

<p class=BODY>The plan to go to <span class=SpellE>Ballesteros</span> the
following Saturday did not materialize because Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span>
(a co-teacher of Milagros), along with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rebanal</span> (a
policeman), arrived to fetch Milagros.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;We learned that you have already <span class=GramE>married,</span>
my daughter&quot;, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span> said.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yes, sir, this could be the place where
I am destined to meet my fate&quot;, Milagros replied.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span> then
said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You had a seminar last
Thursday and you did not come, that is why we came here to get you.&quot;
Milagros agreed to go with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span> who then
said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Get all your <span
class=SpellE>clothings</span>.&quot; Milagros got some of her clothes but left
her other things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Anzo</span> then said to the sister of Reynaldo:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;<span class=SpellE>Herminia</span>, you
lend us a bag and I will place the <span class=SpellE>clothings</span> which
could not be contained in the suit case and I will carry them.&quot; But
Milagros said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No more, sir, I was
able to get all of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Shortly thereafter, the parents of Reynaldo arrived.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros went to the kitchen and said:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Mother, father, you better come along
with us because it seems that they are taking me away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do not care if Boy and I would be punished <span
class=GramE>for,</span> after all, we did what we wanted.&quot; Reynaldo then
said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt'>&quot;Yes, </span>but how could I come along when I have no money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My younger brother got the money I have to
buy merchandize.&quot; Milagros then gave Reynaldo P25.00 saying:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Get this and use it in paying the fare
of those whom you will bring along to talk with my parents.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Reynaldo told Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span> that they should
eat first before leaving but the latter refused and left with Milagros and the
policeman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reynaldo ran following them
and was able to overtake them -- as they were then trying to wait for him — at
the road going to barrio <span class=SpellE>Cabayu</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milagros then told Reynaldo to buy some
biscuits and soft drinks as she was already hungry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reynaldo bought some biscuits and a bottle of
Royal <span class=SpellE>Tru</span> Orange and offered them to Milagros. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span> started
his motorcycle and Milagros boarded it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When Reynaldo tried to give the bottle of Royal <span class=SpellE>Tru</span>
Orange to Milagros, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span> said:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No more, never mind the royal.&quot;
And Milagros was able to get only the biscuits.</p>

<p class=BODY>The evidence for the defense is not clear as to what transpired
thereafter except that it shows that Reynaldo, accompanied by his father and
uncle (the barrio captain), followed Milagros, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anzo</span>
and the policeman, and that, subsequently, Reynaldo received a letter (<span
class=SpellE>Exh</span>. &quot;2&quot;) from Milagros which was <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>written in <span class=SpellE>Ilocano</span>.<span

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Of the two conflicting
versions, the trial court found that of the complainant to be more
credible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It reasoned out as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;First, Milagros Areola is a public school teacher.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By reason of her education, she is expected
to be possessed of that character that would set as an example to be emulated
by the people she comes in contact with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Her <span class=GramE>character were</span> things that have not been
destroyed by the defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
presumption stands that she is a reputable woman and possessed of virtuous
character.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such being the case, it is
not expected that she would accuse falsely a man like the accused to have
abused her honor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She would not stand
public trial, come to Court and expose herself to embarrassment, public
ridicule and probably censure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Among all
these, if the act complained of was not committed, it would not be easy to
think of a <span class=SpellE>provinciana</span> taking the value of her honor
lightly and telling publicly that she has been abused several times by a man
whom she did not love.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The frankness and
candor under which she testified in Court are indicative of her intention and
purpose in filing this case, prosecuting the accused and testifying publicly as
to what happened to her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By so doing,
she has exposed herself to the indignation of members of the fairer sex.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she would have done so on fabricated
charges for after all she had everything to lose and nothing to gain by running
after a man like the accused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As aptly
observed and rated by the highest magistracy of the land that notwithstanding
the modern and western culture, the amiability of the Filipino womanhood has
still been retained.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may have been
a modification of the early Maria Clara but most of the virtues have
remained.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By reason hereof, the
testimony of the offended party must be viewed in the light of their purpose in
bringing before the bar of justice the man who destroyed her honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;On second analysis, the Court would now venture on the
defense of the accused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As stated at the
threshold of this decision, it was the accused alone, who testified in his own
behalf.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He presented a version which
tried to establish that he was a very shy man.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>His shyness springs from the fact that he is an unlettered

cause.</p>

became worse <span class=SpellE>everytime</span> she took the coffee served by
the accused cannot be sustained.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For,
why would the complainant continue taking the coffee if indeed her condition

headache became worse on the 25th and her health poorer on the 26th and 27th is
