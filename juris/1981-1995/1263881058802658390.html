				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking to
annul and set aside the August 28, 1978 decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the
then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Civil Case
No. 20435 enjoining the Pro­vincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and any other person in his behalf from proceeding with the auction sale
predicated upon the petition for extra-judicial foreclosure prayed for by
petitioner Josefina B. <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span>; and the December 4,
1978 Order of the same court denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1976, the spouses Jose <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>
mortgaged to <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Savings and Loan Association,
Inc. their land covered by TCT No. 471634, subject of this case, to secure a
loan of P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said mortgage
was registered with the Registry of Deeds on the same date and was duly
annotated in the title of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 18, 1976, the said mortgaged land was levied upon by the
City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City pursuant to a writ of
execution issued by the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City in Civil Case No. Q-2029 entitled, "Milagros C. <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> Manuel-Pulido”, and eventually, on <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1976</st1:date>, the same was sold to
herein petitioner Josefina B. <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span> who was the
highest bidder in the execution sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 18, 1977, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Savings
and Loan Association, Inc. assigned to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span>
all its rights, interests, and participation to the said mortgage, for the sum
of P8,110.00, representing the unpaid principal obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Pulidos</span> as of October 6, 1976, including interest due and
legal expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, petitioner became
the purchaser at the public auction sale of the subject property as well as the
assignee of the mortgage constitu­ted thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1977</st1:date>,
herein private respondent <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. Rosario <span style="">M. </span>Santos redeemed the said property,
paying the total sum of P15,718.00, and was accordingly issued by the City
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City a Certificate of Redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1977</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span>, as the assignee of the mortgage
loan of the <span class="SpellE">Pulidos</span> which remained unpaid, filed with
the Office of the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, a
verified petition for extra-judicial foreclosure of the mortgage constituted
over the <span style="">subject property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the subject property was adver­tised
for sale at public auction on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="15" month="5"><span style="">May 15, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the oth</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">r
hand, private respondents, spouses Antonio P. Santos and <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
Rosario M. Santos, apprised of the impending auction sale of the said property,
filed an affidavit of adverse claim with the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, claiming that they had become the absolute owners of
the property </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">virtue of the Certi­ficate of Redemption,
dated July 20, 1977, issued by the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City; and </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">May 11, 1978, filed with the respondent court
a verified Petition for Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction to enjoin the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> from proceeding with the
public auction sale of the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this petition, petitioners filed their
Answer on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="5"><span style="">May 18, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondents filed
</span>a <span style="">Motion to Amend Petition
together with the Amended Petition, which was opposed by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, in its Order of </span><st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="7"><span style="">July 17,
 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, denied the
motion and ordered the parties to submit simultaneous memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the parties have
submitted their respective memoranda, the trial court rendered its judgment
dated </span><st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="8"><span style="">August 28, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">
in favor of private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the respondent Provincial
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and any other persons acting in his
behalf are hereby enjoined from proceeding with the auction sale predicated
upon the petition for extra?<span style="">judicial
foreclosure prayed for by respondent Josefina B. <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court held that
the redemption of the subject prop­erty effected by the herein private
respondents, "wipe out and </span>extinguished the mortgage executed by
the <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> spouses in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Savings and Loan Association, Inc."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the trial
court, in its Order of <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="12">December 4,
 1978</st1:date>, denied the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The First Division of this Court, in the Resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1979</st1:date>, gave due course to the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners filed their brief
on <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1979</st1:date> while
respondents failed to file their brief within the required period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, this case was consi­dered
submitted for decision without respondent's brief in the re­solution of <st1:date year="1979" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners raised two (2) assignment of errors, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE PRE-EXISTING MORTGAGE
OBLIGATION OF THE JUDG­MENT DEBTOR CONSTITUTED ON HER PROPERTY WAS WIPED OUT
AND EXTINGUISHED UPON THE PAYMENT OF THE REDEMPTION PRICE WITH THE SHERIFF RE­PRESENTING
THE PURCHASE PRICE PLUS INTEREST DUE THEREON WITHIN THE REDEMPTION PERIOD OF
ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE EXECUTION SALE OF THE SAID PROPERTY TO
SATISFY THE JUDG­MENT DEBT OF THE SAID JUDGMENT DEBTOR.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE <span style="">INSTANT ACTION FILED BY THE HEREIN </span>PRIVATE RESPONDENTS FOR NOT
BEING PROSECUTED IN THE NAME OF THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST AS PROVIDED BY
SECTION 2, RULE 3 OF THE REVISED RULES OF COURT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no question that respondents <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
spouses are the real parties in interest in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 29, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, a real prop­erty
sold by virtue of a writ of execution, may be redeemed by -</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment debtor, or his <u>suc­cessor in
interest</u> in the whole or any part of the property;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A creditor having a lien by attach</span>ment,
judgment or mortgage on the property sold, or on some part thereof, subsequent
to the judgment under which the property was sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such redeeming creditor is termed <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The judgment debtor,
whose property was levied on execution, may transfer his right of redemption to
anyone whom he may desire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term
"successor in interest" includes, among others, one to whom the
debtor has conveyed his interest in the property for the purpose of redemption
(<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> </span>v. Viola <st1:city><st1:place>de <span style="">Soto</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, 61 Phil. 80).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
Rosario M. Santos as an assignee of her sister <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Pulido's</span> right of redemption, redeemed the
questioned property as "successor in interest" of said judgment
debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter interposed no
objection thereto </span>while peti<span style="">tioner
Josefina <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span> acceded unconditionally to the
redemption of the property sold on execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, the main issue
in this case is whether or not the redemption of the questioned property by
herein private respondents wiped out and extinguished the pre-existing mortgage
obligation of the judgment debtor, <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> for the security of which (mortgage debt) the
subject property had been encumbered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The answer is in the
negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 30, Rule 39 of
the Rules of Court, provides for the time, manner and the amount to be paid to
redeem a property sold by virtue </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent portion reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and
manner of, and amounts payable on, successive redemptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice to be given and filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The judgment debtor, or <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>,
may redeem the property from the purchaser, at any time within twelve (12)
months after the sale, on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase, with
one per centum per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of
redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser
may have paid thereon after purchase, and interest on such last-named amount at
the same rate; <u>and if the purchaser be also a cre­ditor having a prior lien
to that of the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, other than the judgment
under which such purchase was made, the amount of such other lien, with
interest</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Under­scoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the above-quoted provision, if the purchaser is also a
creditor having a prior lien to that of the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>,
other than the judgment under which such purchase was made, the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> has to pay, in addition to the prescribed
amounts, such other prior lien of the creditor-purchaser with interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, it will be recalled that on <st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1976</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Pulidos</span>
mortgaged the subject property to <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Savings
and Loan Association, Inc. who, in turn, <span style="">on
</span><st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1977</st1:date>,
assigned the same to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1976</st1:date>, pursuant to the writ of execution issued in
Civil Case No. Q-2029 (Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span> is not a
party in this case No. Q-2029), the subject property was sold to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span>, being the highest bidder in the execu­tion
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1977</st1:date>; private respondent <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
Rosario M. Santos redeemed the subject property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, there is no ques­tion that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span> as assignee of the mortgage
constituted over the subject property, is also a creditor having a <span class="SpellE">priof</span> (mort­gage) lien to that of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
Rosario M. Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
acceptance of the redemption amount by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span>,
without demanding payment of her prior lien - the mortgage obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Pulidos</span> - cannot wipe out and extinguish said mortgage
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage directly and
immediately subjects the property upon which it is imposed, whoever the
possessor may be, to the fulfill­ment of the obligation for whose security it
was constituted (Art. 2126, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise stated, a mortgage creates a real right which is enforceable
against the whole world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, even if
the mortgaged property is sold (Art. 2128) or its possession trans­ferred to
another (Art. 2129), the property remains subject to the fulfillment of the
obligation for whose security it was constituted (Padilla, Civil Code
annotated, Vol. VII. p. 207, 1975 ed.).</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that Rule 39 of the Rules of Court is silent as
to the effect of the acceptance by the purchaser, who is also a creditor,
having a prior lien to that of the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, of
the redemption amount, without demanding payment of her prior lien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it provide whether or not the
redemption of the property sold in execution sale freed the redeemed property
from prior liens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, where the
prior lien consists of a mortgage constituted on the property redeemed, as in
the case at bar, such <span style="">redemption does
not extinguish the mortgage (Art. 2126).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, a mortgage previously registered, like in the instant case,
</span>cannot be prejudiced by any subsequent lien or encumbrance annotated at
the back of the certificate of title (Gonzales v. Intermediate Appellate Court,
157 SCRA 587 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it must be stressed that private respondents re­deemed
the property in question as "successor in interest" of the judgment
debtor, and as such are deemed subrogated to the rights and obligations of the
judgment debtor and are bound by exactly the same condition relative to the
redemption of the subject property that bound the latter as debtor and
mortgagor (<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 172 SCRA 125
[1989]; citing the case of <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> vs. Santos, G.R.
No. L-30079, <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>,
69 SCRA 191).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents, by
stepping in the judgment debtor's shoes, had the obligation to pay the mortgage
debt, otherwise, the debt would and could be enforced against the property
mortgaged (<span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> vs. Rehabilitation Finance
Corporation, 176 SCRA 493 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, considering the lapse of time that the parties have
been in status quo and the fact that private respondents erro­neously believed
that the questioned property was freed from any lien after the redemption,
equity dictates that the foreclosure be allowed only after the private
respondents shall have been afforded the chance to settle the mortgage
obligation but failed to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> </span>the questioned <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1978</st1:date> judgment of the trial court is
Reversed and Set Aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
Josefina B. <span class="SpellE">Cenas</span> may proceed with the foreclosure of
the mortgaged property after the private respondents shall have failed to
settle the mortgage debt plus interest and legal expenses, within thirty (30)
days from finality of this decision.</p>
