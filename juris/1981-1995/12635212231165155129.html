Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga 
finding appellant Leonardo Pamintuan guilty of parricide and sentencing 
him to reclusion perpetua and to indem­nify the heirs of the deceased in
 the sum of P12,000.00.
<p>
The judgment of conviction was based solely on circumstantial evidence, 
the prosecution having failed to produce an eyewitness to the crime.  
Contending that the evidence is grossly insufficient to support a 
finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, appellant seeks reversal of 
the judgment.
</p><p>
The facts established by the testimonies of the six (6) witnesses for 
the prosecution, namely:  Pat. Baldomero Maneses and Pat. Cesar Ocampo 
of the Angeles City Police Department, Dr. Ponciano Malonzo, Dr. Leo 
Sabio, Romulo Samonte de Jesus, and Jaime Padilla, are as follows:  At 
about 2:45 in the afternoon of February 18, 1971, Pat. Baldomero Maneses
 received a report that appellant and his wife Corazon de Jesus were 
engaged in a fight at their house in Bo. Lourdes Northwest, Angeles 
City.  Pat. Maneses, Pat. Cesar Ocampo and PC Constable Macapugay 
immediately responded to the call.  When they knocked at the house of 
appellant, the latter and his sister Anastacia appeared at the window 
and informed the police officers that everything was alright and that 
the incident between appellant and his wife was a minor incident.  When 
asked about his wife, appellant replied that she was resting inside 
their bedroom.
</p><p>
After the police left, appellant called Dr. Leo Sabio.  Upon his arrival
 at the appellant's house, the doctor saw Corazon de Jesus ("the same 
woman shown in the picture Exhibit G and G-1") lying on the floor, with 
multiple injuries on her body.  He examined her with a stethoscope and 
found her bereft of any sign of life.  She had no heartbeat and was no 
longer breathing.  The doctor's attempt to revive her was of no avail.  
Before Dr. Sabio left, he told appellant that he could not do anything 
because his wife was already dead.
</p><p>
At 5:00 in the afternoon, Pat. Maneses received a call from a person who
 identified himself as Leonardo Pamintuan, brother of the appellant.  He
 reported that his sister-in-law Corazon de Jesus had been murdered.  
When the policemen arrived at the appellant's dwelling, appellant and 
his sister were no longer in the house.  The lifeless body of Corazon 
was on the floor, lying on a pool of blood.
</p><p>
Dr. Ponciano Malonzo, City Health Officer of Angeles City, who conducted an autopsy, described the victim's injuries as follows:
</p><blockquote>

    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
That evening, appellant's sister Anastacia Pamintuan executed an affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 stating therein, among others, that early that afternoon her younger 
sister arrived to inform her that appellant and his wife were 
quarrelling in their house; that she (Anastacia) ran to the house of her
 brother at Lourdes Northwest; that at said house, she noticed that 
Corazon had a wound on her eyebrow and was moaning in pain; and that 
when she asked what happened, her brother answered that it was none of 
her business.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, appellant had disappeared, leaving no trace as to his 
whereabouts.  He was not apprehended until October 12, 1973, or more 
than two and a half years after the commission of the crime.
</p><p>
The evidence for the defense consists of the lone testimony of the 
appellant himself.  He declared that he and his deceased wife were 
married nine or ten years ago and they had four children.  He was a 
barber at the Airman's Club.  On February 18, 1971, he did not report 
for work because he went to Baby's Kitchenette at Mirasol Village.  When
 he returned home at about 9:00 in the evening, the house was pitch 
dark.  Upon turning on the lights, he saw a man jump out of the window. 
 His wife Corazon was lying on the floor, completely naked and hurting 
from her wounds.  Her hands were tied together with an electric wire and
 her mouth gagged with a piece of cloth.  He untied her and asked what 
had happened.  She cried and embraced him, muttering the name of their 
neighbor "Datda", a policeman named Leonardo Salas, whom he had 
suspected of being his wife's paramour.  At that moment, his wife 
admitted to him that she was carrying on an illi­cit relationship with 
Datda.
</p><p>
Because of the serious condition of his wife, appellant called Dr. Sabio
 and the latter examined her and gave her an injection.  When the doctor
 left, Corazon was still very much alive.
</p><p>
Some policemen later arrived and knocked at the door of appellant's 
house.  Appellant went out; and when the peace officers inquired what 
the trouble was, appellant told them that nothing was the matter.  After
 the policemen had left, appellant told his wife that he was going out 
to take a stroll.  He went to Pauline's Place where he boarded a 
Philippine Rabbit bus.  He alighted at the town of San Fernando.  After 
taking a bottle of coca-cola at a store, he decided to take a bus bound 
for Manila.  He returned to Angeles City on February 2, 1972 when he 
learned that his father died.  According to appellant, he left Angeles 
City because he was being hunted for liquidation by the BSDUs and the 
Monkeys.
</p><p>
We find no cogent reason to set aside the trial court's judgment.  While
 the prosecution failed to present an eyewitness to the crime, the chain
 of circumstances, prior and subsequent to the killing, leaves no room 
for doubt that appellant is the guilty person.  The rule is that before 
conviction upon circumstantial evidence, the circumstances proved should
 constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable 
conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as 
the author of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In the case at bar, this requisite has been fully met.
</p><p>
Appellant testified that when he arrived home at 9:00 in the evening of 
the day in question, he found his wife Corazon a victim of violence; 
that she was covered with blood and completely naked; that her hands 
tied with an electric wire and her mouth covered with a piece of cloth. 
 Yet, when the police officers came to his house and inquired what the 
trouble was, he told them that nothing was the matter.  Obviously, he 
turned away the police officers in order to prevent discovery of his own
 dastardly deed.
</p><p>
The Solicitor General noted that the burns on the nipples, the vulva and
 mons veneris of the deceased demonstrate the sexual motivation of the 
killing.  We agree.
</p><p>
Even before the incident, appellant had been suspicious of his wife's 
infidelity, and this suspicion was confirmed when, according to the 
appellant himself, Corazon admitted to him that she had been carrying on
 an illicit affair with their neighbor Datda.  This fact, coupled with 
the findings of the Assistant City Health Officer as to the sadistic 
nature of the wounds sustained by the victim, lead to no other 
conclusion than that the injuries had been inflicted by an enraged and 
jealous husband.
</p><p>
The conduct of the appellant after the incident strongly establish his 
guilt.  Dr. Sabio testified that when he examined the victim in the 
afternoon of February 28, 1975, the latter was already dead.  Appellant,
 however, insists that his wife was still alive when the doctor left his
 house.  But whether Corazon was dead or alive at that time, it 
certainly appears most unnatural that a husband and father of four 
children of tender years would have abandoned his family, especially 
when his wife was in serious physical condition.  Indeed, appellant fled
 in order to avoid arrest, knowing as he did that the fight between 
himself and his wife had already been reported to the police.  As has 
been enunciated by this Court time again, "flight is considered as 
evidence tending to establish guilt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>
Appellant asserts that Datda or Leonardo Salas could have been the 
author of the crime.  Such theory must be rejected considering that 
appellant himself did not even denounce Datda when the police came to 
his house.  As correctly noted by the lower court:  "The accused implies
 that another man, a certain Datda or Leonardo Salas, was probably the 
one responsible for the death of his wife; however; he admits that this 
person is already dead and therefore' this prevents any verification of 
his claim.  This is his defense which he should prove, and certainly he 
has not proven it."
</p><p>
In fine, the absence of an eyewitness account of the killing 
notwithstanding, the circumstantial evidence established affords 
sufficient basis for a reasonable inference that the victim was killed 
by her own husband, the appellant herein.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.  With costs against appellant.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
