<p class="BODY">The consolidated Decision of the Trial Court convicted ALCANTARA

<span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangaoang</span>, a

La Union, packing his clothes in preparation for his trip to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Josefina, his fifteen year old daughter, and

could not go with the latter to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
as agreed upon, because he was busy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They lingered a while on the Father's invitation that they have supper,
which was almost ready.</p>

<p class="BODY">While waiting, APPELLANT and ALCANTARA commented that COMPLAINANT
was embraced by a man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Father asked
COMPLAINANT about the truth of the remark but was met with silence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Angered, the Father slapped her twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abellera</span> held
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>COMPLAINANT sat down and
cried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT threatened the father
saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"You do what you want and
we will kill you!"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
COMPLAINANT and her two brothers, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>, Jr. (13
years old) and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> (9 years old), then left for
their grandfather's house as was customary whenever their father went to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT and ALCANTARA left also, while <span class="SpellE">Abellera</span> held the father, who was struggling to be
released.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abellera</span>
freed him and jumped down from the kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Father searched for his <u>bolo</u> but could not find it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then followed to his father's house where
he told his children to go, but his children were not there as he had expected.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the three children were walking to their grandfather's
house, APPELLANT and ALCANTARA overtook them and held <span class="SpellE">COMPLAINANT's</span>
hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT pointed a knife at her
breast and warned her not to scream.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>, Jr. ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> clung to his sister's dress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the <span class="SpellE"><u>camachile</u></span>
tree, APPELLANT made indecent advances but she pushed him away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT told ALCANTARA to go back to <span class="SpellE">COMPLAINANT's</span> house and get her trunk, while he stood
guard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, ALCANTARA came
back carrying the trunk on his shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They then proceeded towards the river.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>APPELLANT separated from them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>ALCANTARA was with them as they went on a circuitous way to his
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On reaching <span class="SpellE">ALCANTARA's</span>
hut around <st1:time hour="9" minute="0">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening,
APPELLANT was already there, leaning on a post partly hiding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside the one-room hut, where ALCANTARA, a
widower and three of his minor children lived, ALCANTARA lighted a lamp and
spread a mat, telling COMPLAINANT and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> to lie
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then blew out the light and
went down.</p>

<p class="BODY">COMPLAINANT was roused from her sleep by <span class="GramE">a
heaviness</span> on top of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>ALCANTARA was upon her, facing her while she was lying on her back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His breath smelled of liquor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She screamed but a dagger was pointed at
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT was sitting on the trunk
near her head, holding her hands upward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her skirt was already drawn up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She noticed that she no longer had her panty on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ALCANTARA had carnal knowledge of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt pain and blood oozed from her
private part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT told ALCANTARA
to hurry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">few </span>minutes, she felt something come
out and the world was whirling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>APPELLANT and ALCANTARA exchanged positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT, too, abused her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

APPELLANT left the hut and told ALCANTARA to do as he pleases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ALCANTARA abused her again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She could not resist as she was not even
strong enough to shout.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
At the corner of the room she cried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
siren at the Municipal Hall sounded at <st1:time hour="10" minute="0">10:00

<p class="BODY">APPELLANT, on his way home, passed the house of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Mangaoang</span>, <span class="SpellE">COMPLAINANT's</span>
grandfather.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Father was there and
saw APPELLANT but the Father's sister prevented him from going out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, she asked APPELLANT where
COMPLAINANT was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>APPELLANT denied
knowing COMPLAINANT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Father went
home and saw clothes scattered around and a trunk missing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was then told by <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>,
Jr., that COMPLAINANT was dragged by APPELLANT and ALCANTARA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded to <span class="SpellE">APPELLANT's</span>
house but he was not there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Father
did not know where to locate <span class="SpellE">ALCANTARA's</span> house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next morning, the Father confronted APPELLANT but the latter
denied knowing COMPLAINANT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
early the same morning, ALCANTARA forcibly made COMPLAINANT ride a tricycle to
the highway and from there they took a bus to <span class="SpellE">Paratong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>, La Union, to his aunt's house where he left
her, telling his aunt that COMPLAINANT had run away and was looking for work.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, the Father reported the matter to Sgt. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Zarate</span>, desk officer of the <span class="SpellE">Aringay</span>
Police Force, who instructed Pat. <span class="GramE">Mariano <span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span>

were interrogated and ALCANTARA was ordered to fetch COMPLAINANT from <span class="SpellE">Paratong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon being
reunited with her father, COMPLAINANT narrated how she had been ravished, and
the next day, she went for a physical examination first at the <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> Memorial Hospital
but was referred instead to the Provincial Hospital in San Fernando, La Union
due to "lack of facilities." Dr. Norma <span class="SpellE">Boado</span>
examined her and came up with the following findings:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Vulva - reddened.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Vaginal smear - Positive
for spermatozoa."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Boado</span>
testified that the reddening of the vulva was caused by forcible contact with a
hard object; that COMPLAINANT was a virgin as it appeared that the tear in the
hymen had not yet healed; that there was smearing of blood; and that the
vaginal canal was tight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The laceration
indicated that the sexual act occurred between 24 to 48 hours before the
examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No other injuries were
found on the person of COMPLAINANT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
