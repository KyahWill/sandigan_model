stipulated in the above-said contract, a letter of credit for US $86,142.55 was

dismiss on the ground that it had voluntarily submitted itself to the

issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> in the Motion to Dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case is whether or not respondent Court
has acquired jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner, a foreign
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Motion to Dismiss, petitioner interposed that the court
has no jurisdiction over its person primarily because it is a United States
corporation with principal address at One Industrial Avenue, Lowell,
Massachusetts, U.S.A., is not domiciled in the Philippines, does not have any
office or place of business in the Philippines, is not licensed to engage and is
not engaging in business here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>EXXBYTE
upon whom summons was served on behalf of this defendant is a local company
entirely separate and distinct from and is not the representative of the
defendant (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 57-60).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue is not novel in our jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are three (3) modes of effecting service of summons upon
private foreign corporations as provided for in Section 14, Rule 7 of the Rules
of Court, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) by serving upon
the agent designated in accordance with law to accept service of summons; (2)
if there is no resident agent, by service on the government official designated
by law to that office; and (3) by serving on any officer or agent of said
corporation within the Philippines (Far East Int'l. <span class="GramE">Import

Manila (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 57) as its duly authorized and
exclusive representative and distributor in the Philippines (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 24 and P. 149).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner opposed such service and filed a Motion to Dismiss on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction on its person, being a foreign corporation not
engaged in business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidence presented by private respondent
however, shows that contrary to petitioner's allegations, the various public
advertisements of WANG and EXXBYTE clearly show that Wang has appointed
EXXBYTE, which is domiciled in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
as its authorized exclusive representative in this country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, WANG represents that its office in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is EXXBYTE, while the letterhead of EXXBYTE and its invoices show that it is <span class="SpellE">WANG's</span> representative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 65).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in its Reply to Opposition to

documentary evidence proving that the defendant Wang has properties in the
Philippines consisting of trademarks registered with the Philippine Patent
Office and that WANG designated Rafael E. Evangelista of 638 Philippine Banking
Building, Ayala Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Metro Manila as its
Resident Agent upon whom notice or process <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner insists on its
argument that extra-judicial summons or any kind thereof cannot bind the

S.A. et al., 138 SCRA 118 [1985]), it was held that no general rule or
governing principle can be laid down as to what constitutes doing or
"engaging" or "trading" in business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed each case must be judged in the light
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">its </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

341-342, Annex "S" to Petitioner's Brief).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wang has allowed its registered logo and
trademark to be used by EXXBYTE (<span class="SpellE">Pran</span> Deposition, p.

as published in its advertisements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed it has been held that "where a single act or
transaction of a foreign corporation is not merely incidental or casual but is
of such character as distinctly to indicate a purpose to do other business in
the State, such act constitutes doing business within the meaning of statutes
prescribing the conditions under which a foreign corporation may be served with
summons (Far East Int'l. <span class="GramE">Import and Export Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Nankai</span> Kogyo Co. Ltd., 6 SCRA 725 [1962]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, the issue on the suability of foreign
corporation whether or not doing business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has already been laid to rest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
has categorically stated that although a foreign corporation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>not doing business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
it may be sued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for </span>acts done
against persons in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Court
</span>has ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Indeed if a foreign corporation, not engaged in business in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is not barred from seeking redress from courts in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
a <u>fortiori</u>, that same corporation cannot claim exemption from being sued
in Philippine courts for acts done against a person or persons in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Facilities Management Corporation v. De la <span class="SpellE">Osa</span>, 89
SCRA 131 [1979]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, even though petitioner objects to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the </span>jurisdiction
of the Court over its person, the fact <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">that </span>it alleged non-jurisdictional grounds in
its pleadings indicates that it has waived lack of jurisdiction of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted by the trial court, defendant Wang (petitioner herein)
in its Motion to Dismiss sought affirmative <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
requiring the exercise of jurisdiction, by praying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) for authority to take testimony by way of
deposition upon oral examination; (2) for extension of time to file opposition
to plaintiffs' motion to effect Extraterritorial Service of Summons; (3) to
hold in abeyance any and all proceedings relative to plaintiffs' foregoing
motion and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(4) </span>to consider as a
mere scrap of paper plaintiff's motion to strike out Deposition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 111).</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the records show that petitioner also prayed
for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) authority to reset date of
taking of depo<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sition; (2) admission of
the formal stenographic notes and </span>(3) suspension of time to file
responsive pleadings, not to mention its various participation in the
proceedings in the court other than for the purpose of objecting to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">lack </span>of
jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 169).</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, it is well settled that "A voluntary appearance is
a waiver of the necessity of formal notice." <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Thus, </span>it has been held that when the ap<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

jurisdiction of the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

objecting to the jurisdiction of the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the appearance is for any other purpose, the defendant is deemed to
have submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such an appearance gives the court
jurisdiction over the person (Flores v. <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span>, 37
Phil. 746 [1918]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clarifying further,
the Court has likewise ruled that even though the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">defendant objects to </span>the jurisdiction of the Court, if at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the same time he </span>alleges any
