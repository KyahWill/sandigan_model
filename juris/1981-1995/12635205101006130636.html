going down the stairs, appellant told him to leave, which he did, and then he
proceeded on his way to his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
that, the five men, including <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> -- who did not
talk to him nor did he talk to them -- left and went towards <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>coconut

accused -- without <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> -- ­going back to <span class="SpellE">Generoso's</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So
he hid under <span class="SpellE">Generoso's</span> house (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., April 22, 1970; pp. 36-38, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

house, all the four accused, including <span class="GramE">appellant,</span> went
up the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he heard

<p class="BODY">After seeing all these horrible events, <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span>
hurriedly left the place and proceeded to his home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He went up his house and hung the guitar he
borrowed earlier from <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, and then went down
and hid in a pile of cogon grass, near his house, which was intended for
roofing (p. 13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., April 22, 1970; p. 55, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., May 21, 1970).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

including the appellant herein, approaching.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon arriving in front of his house, they called for him, but he did not
respond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, with the aid of a
flashlight, they went up his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
finding him, they left.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He remained in
hiding in the pile of cogon grass until early the next morning of May <span class="GramE">6, 1965.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he went
out of his hiding place, he heard Loreto <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
son of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, shouting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He went to the place where Loreto was and
there he saw <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> dead, with wounds in his body
and with his neck almost severed from the body (pp. 13-15, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
April 22, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove the motive behind the crime, the State presented Loreto <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, son of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> and
Victoria, and brother of <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among other things, this witness testified
that about a week before May 5, 1965, appellant came to their place at Port
Junction and asked his father to redeem a plow, which was earlier lost by his
father, for the sum of P50.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
father refused, saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Why should
I redeem, since the plow is mine," and adding that he would bring the
matter to the attention of the PC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant never­theless promised to produce the plow within one week but
he failed to make good his promise (pp. 3-4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
June 9, 1970).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, in the afternoon of
May 5, 1965, while he and his father were plowing their land in barrio <span class="SpellE">Luhung</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ragay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, the accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Basit</span> and Pedro Suarez came and asked his father whether it
was true that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">suspected both of them
of having stolen his plow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>His
father replied in the affirmative and, after that, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Basit</span>
and Pedro Suarez said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"You <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">(will) </span>have your day" (pp. 4-6, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., June 9, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">Loreto <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> further testified
that aside from the two incidents narrated above; there was a grudge between
the appellant, on one hand, and his parents, on the other; because David <span class="SpellE">Panga­niban</span>, a brother of appellant, raped his mother
Victoria <span class="SpellE">Gunda</span> sometime in 1965, although the act of
David was later forgiven and the case never reached the court (pp. 9-10, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., June 9, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, appellant denied participation in the crime imputed
to him and put up the defense of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">alibi.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Among
other things, the appellant testi­fied that he and <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>
were first cousins, their fathers being brothers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He declared that at about 7:00 o'clock in the
morning of May 5, 1965, he left his house at Port Junction, <span class="SpellE">Ragay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and
proceeded to the law office of Atty. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ser­vano</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City to get from the latter certain documents
pertaining to the land of his parents and to bring the sum of P200.00 due to
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Servano</span> for legal services rendered to his
(appellant's) father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After delivering
the money to, and receiv­ing the land title from, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Servano</span>
at about 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, he strolled around the
city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about 8:00 o'clock in the
evening he went to the railroad station of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City,
and at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, he boarded an express train for
Manila, stopping at <span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
from where he could take a rail-bus the following morning for Port
Junction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He passed the night of May 5,
1965 in the <span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span> railroad station and when a <span class="SpellE">railbus</span> from <span class="SpellE">Hondagua</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, arrived at about 4:00 o'clock in the morning of May
6, 1965, he boarded it; but the <span class="SpellE">railbus</span> left <span class="SpellE">Tagkawayan</span> bound for <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>,
passing Port Junction, at about 5:30 o'clock already in the morning of the same
day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arriving at Port Junction an hour
later, he disembarked and proceeded to his home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arriving home, his wife told him that <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, his wife Victoria and their daughter <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> "were already dead" (pp. 17-22, 28, 29,
38, 40, 42, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Sept. 2, 1970).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being a close relative of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>,
he went to the place of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Arriving there, he saw <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> and Victoria dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">remained in the house of the
dead couple and their daughter until they were buried on May 7, 1965, and
during that period he helped in preparing </span>the food for the
visitors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further testified that in
the house of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, he also saw his cousins, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eufracio</span>, both
brothers of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, and his uncle Diego <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, who is also an uncle of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> <span class="SpellE">Panga­niban</span> and
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He concluded his direct testimony by stating that his father <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his wife </span>and family were also in the
house of the victims on that day and that Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span>
also helped them on that occasion (pp. 22-25, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Sept. 2, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further testified that after the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Ragay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, dismissed the case against him, he and his family
moved their residence, in January, 1966, from Port Junc­tion, <span class="SpellE">Ragay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, to <span class="SpellE">Guinayangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, where he was arrested by the PC on February 12,
1968 after residing there for about two years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also testified that when he left Port Junction to reside in <span class="SpellE">Guinayangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, he told
Diego <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, his uncle and also an uncle of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eufracio</span>, a brother of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, and of course his father, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, about the transfer of his residence (pp.
43-44, 46, 47, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Sept. 2, 1970).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>transfer of his resi­dence in 1966, he returned to Port
Junction about two (2) times -- the first in May, 1966 when he visited and
stayed with his father for two days and got some seedlings, and the second,
sometime in the year 1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
categorically declared also that when he was still residing in Port Junction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and even </span>after he had transferred his
residence to <span class="SpellE">Guinayangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
he never received any sub­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">poena,
whether through a policeman or from anyone </span>else, from the Provincial
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did his father, much less any other
person, tell him about the existence of a warrant for his arrest the second
time that he visited his father in the year 1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, sometime before January, 1966, one <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span> told him that he
would have a trial, so he went to his lawyer, Atty. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ser­vano</span>,
who accompanied him to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span> of the Office
of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(pp. </span>49,
50-51, 54, 57, 58-59, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Sept. 2, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also testified that the other accused -- Vicente Suarez,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Basit</span> and Pedro Suarez -- were also in the
house of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> at about 2:00 o'clock in the
afternoon of May 6, 1965 (pp. 110-111, Sept. 3, 1970 <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He concluded his testimony by flatly denying
having received any subpoena issued by the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">D, E and F, which were later on
withdrawn by the prose­cution), for him to appear before the investigating
fiscal on July 19 and 20, 1966.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, no policeman ever came to him to deliver such sub­poena;
besides at that time he was already residing in <span class="SpellE">Guinayangan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
likewise denied having signed such subpoena or the return thereof (pp. 89­-93, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Sept 3, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">A searching analysis of the foregoing testimony of <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> shows that, contrary to the usual pattern of human
behavior and the normal reaction of man in times of stress, this star witness
for the prosecution did not report the killing of his brother-in-law, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">latter's wife and daughter to the PC at the
earliest opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the
record, the PC finally came up with a complaint before the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Ragay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, only on May 18, 1965, or thirteen (13) days after the

15.0pt">that <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> revealed the identity of the
alleged killers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It taxes credulity that
<span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> made no effort to expose the accused either
on May 6 or May 7, 1965 when, according to him, he saw the brothers of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> on those days in the house of the victims and that
Sgt. Gonzalez of the PC first questioned him on May 6 and 7, 1965 on what he
knew of the killing (p. 62, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., May 21,
1970).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Catapang's</span>
silence for about thirteen (13) days casts serious doubt on his subsequent
identification of the appellant and the three other accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had he really recognized the appellant and
the three other accused as the per­petrators of the crime, he would have
spontaneously reported the crime and revealed the identity of the killers at
the earliest opportunity, as would be expected according to the natural
reaction of man under such circumstances, especially when the murdered victims
were his close relatives and neighbors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Catapang's</span> claim that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was </span>afraid that he might be killed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">is </span>not supported by the evidence of
record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was not threatened by any of
the killers, If he were afraid of reprisal, he would have avoided going with
the appellant to a place about 150 to 200 meters away from the house of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> for the purpose of getting bamboos with which to
carry the remains of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, if he were afraid, he would
not have gone home after witnessing the gruesome murders; instead, he would
have instinctively dashed off to the barrio captain or any other authority, or
to one of the brothers of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, like <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, whose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">house was only 80 meters away from the place
where the incident happened, and there sought refuge and told everything he
witnessed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, would it not be more in consonance with common
experience for <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> to have at least whispered to
Sgt. Gonzalez of the PC, or to any one of the brothers of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>,
like <span class="SpellE">Mar­cial</span> or <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span>,
when he saw them the day after the murder -- on May 6, 1965 -- in the house of
the victims, that the real culprits were the appellant and the three other
accused, especially considering that on that day, as the records show, all the
accused were present in the house of the victims?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Pp. 110-111, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Sept. 3, 1970).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this way, the culprits could have been
easily and safely held in prison or detained in the con­stabulary barracks and
thus prevent them from frustrating justice by flight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it were, the accused were not ordered
arrested until May 18, 1965 (p. 11, Vol. <span class="GramE">I, rec.), when Sgt.
Gonzalez of the PC filed the corresponding criminal complaint before the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Ragay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> (p. 1, Vol. 1, rec.).</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another fact of substance and value which was
not fully appreciated by the trial court in favor of the appellant is the
presence -- on May 6 and 7, 1965 -- of the appellant in the house of the
victims after the incident on May 5, 1965, which fact stands <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

which to carry the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>remains of the
victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the appellant were one of
the authors of the heinous crime or that he had in some way participated
therein as a co-conspirator, as the State would want this Court to believe, it
strikes Us as rather highly improbable and contrary to the natural instinct of
man for self-preservation for the appellant too have the temerity and the bold­ness
to expose himself to the danger of being the object of vengeance from the
relatives of the victims, who were practically all present with <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> during the autopsy, dressing and burying the
remains of the victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Apropos</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

any of the relatives of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, who knew of the
transfer of his residence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In short, he
did not attempt to elude justice when he transferred his residence because he
even visited Port Junction, his former residence, twice after he left <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> -- once in May
1966, when he visited </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">stayed

<p class="BODY">WE find the explanation of the appellant credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the delay in the trial of this case

there is one, is located behind the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> or towards

<p class="BODY">Analyzing the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> declaration
of Loreto on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1965</st1:date>
as against his testimony before the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">of </span>June 9, 1970, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the two
sets of testimony suffer from the same vice as the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span>, earlier discussed above, since they are
contradictory to, and inconsistent with, each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before Judge <span class="SpellE">Huertas</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Ragay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, this witness declared that he knew for the first time
that his mother and sister were dead at about <u>7:00 o'clock P.M. of May 6,
1965,</u> when he saw his mother and his sister dead with wounds still
"lying on the hammock on the floor"; while before the trial court
about five years later he declared that he saw his father, his mother and his
sister dead <u>in the morning of May 6, 1965.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two declarations, being contradictory to
each other, one or the other must be incorrect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, a doubt is cast upon the credibility of this witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not to count the fact that he is a
son of the victims <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">Gunda</span> and a brother of the third victim, <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">possibility of the existence of bias is not remote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, if it is true, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as claimed </span>by this witness, that he returned
home at 12:00 midnight of May 5, 1965, and woke up between 5:00 and 6:00
o'clock in the morning of May 6, 1965, to tend to his cows in the field, it is
almost unbelievable that he did not see his mother and his sister already dead
in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of their house with bolo wounds in their
necks measuring about six inches in length (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">B and C, pp. 64-65, Vol.</span> <span class="GramE">I, rec.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, appellant's defense of <u>alibi</u> becomes
significant since, as pointed out earlier, there is a total absence of positive
and clear identification of the appellant as one of those responsible<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>for the death of the victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, <span class="GramE">We</span> have
time and again stressed that <u>alibi</u> is the weakest of all defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is easy to concoct, difficult to disprove
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, L-17599, April 24, 1967, 19 SCRA
769, 783, citing U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Olais</span>, 36 Phil. 828, 829;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, 51 Phil. 965, 966; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, 76 Phil. 265, 272; People vs. Bautista, L-17772,
Oct. 31, 1962, 6 SCRA 522, 529; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dayday</span>,
L-20806 &amp; L-20807, Aug. 14, 1965, 14 SCRA 935, 942).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, where, as in the case at bar,
the evidence for the prosecution is weak and betrays lack of concreteness on
the question of whether or not appellant is the author of the crime charged, <u>alibi</u>
as a defense assumes significance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>, et al. (L-12005, Aug. 31, 1960, 109 Phil. 241, 250),
pointed out:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"The rule that <u>alibi</u>
must be satisfactorily proven was never intended to change the burden of proof
in criminal <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">cases; </span>otherwise,
we will <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">see </span>the absurdity of an
accused being put in a more difficult position where the prosecution's evidence
is vague and weak than where it is strong" (cited in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pampaluna</span>, 96 SCRA 790, 815).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Criminal Case No.</span> L-437 where
accused-appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment <u>(reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>) by the trial court, should be deemed also
included in this automatic review of the death penalty imposed on him in the
other two cases, L-438 and L-439, although accused-appellant did not expressly
appeal his convic­tion in L-437.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Judiciary Act, otherwise known as R.A. 296, as amended,
"the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction in all criminal cases
involving offenses for which the penalty imposed is death or life imprisonment;
and those involving other offenses which, although not so punished, arose out
of the same occurrence or which may have been committed by the accused on the
same occasion, as that giving rise to the more serious offense, regardless of
whether the accused are charged as principals, accomplices or accessories, or
whether they have been tried jointly or separately" (par. 1, Sec. 17).</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision, the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over other offenses not
so punished by death or life <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">imprisonment,
but arising "out of the same occurrence <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">or </span>committed by the accused on the same occasion, as that giving
rise to the more serious offense," even if the accused is merely charged
as an accomplice, or accessory and even when the cases are tried separately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be emphasized that the subject matter under automatic
review in these cases, G.R. Nos. L-33822-<span class="GramE">23,</span> is the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">joint decision</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>of the trial court in the three
criminal cases Nos. L-437, L-438 and L-439 against the same accused-appellant
for the murder of the spouses and their 13-year-old daughter on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">same night of May 5, 1965, and not three
separate deci­sions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It would be absurd to require accused-appellant, under the
peculiar circumstances, to file a separate appeal in L-437 because the three
criminal cases of which he was convicted by the trial court in a single
decision are so intertwined with each other, the three cases having arisen on
the same occasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore patent that criminal case <span class="GramE">No</span>.
L-437 is deemed <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> appealed together with the two death
sentence cases (L-438 and L-439) notwithstanding the absence of an express
appeal by the accused-appellant in said criminal case No. <span class="GramE">L-437.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All the three criminal cases are necessarily
involved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in and affected by the
discussion and the prayer (the Solicitor General prayed for the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the judgment of conviction by the trial court
in the three criminal cases) in the briefs filed by the State, by the defense and
Our review of the joint decision in these three cases which relate </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the entire tragedy that resulted in three
murders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The principal target was the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
of whose murder appellant was sentenced by the trial court to only <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the accused-appellant who is a mere farmer, must have
assumed that when the clerk of court forwarded the cases to the Supreme Court
on automatic review, all three cases (L-437, L-438 and L-439) were so
forwarded, as in fact they were as shown by the endorsement or transmittal (pp.
80-83, rec.) of the transcript of the three cases by the branch clerk of court
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> to the Clerk of Court, Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it would be a burden too heavy if, under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>circumstances of these cases, the
accused-appellant had to file a separate petition for review in Criminal Case
No. <span class="GramE">L-437.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, rules of procedure should not be given a strict or rigid
interpretation where, as in the case at bar, the life and liberty of an accused
are at stake.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The life and liberty of
the accused-appellant should not be sacrificed at "the sophisticated altar
of technicalities."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> WE FIND THAT THE GUILT OF THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT
MOISES PANGANIBAN HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>THE JUDGMENT APPEALED FROM IS, THEREFORE,
REVERSED AND SET ASIDE, AND THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT IS HEREBY ACQUITTED OF THE
CHARGES AGAINST HIM IN ALL THE THREE CASES -- L-437, L-438 and L-439 -- AND HIS
IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE FROM CUSTODY, UNLESS HE IS HELD ON SOME OTHER VALID CHARGE,
IS HEREBY ORDERED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>NO COSTS.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J</i>.:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the single
decision, which Judge Augusto L. Valencia rendered in the three murder cases
filed against Moises Panganiban (tried jointly)<span class="GramE">,</span> he
sentenced Panganiban to <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> in Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">L-437, involving the killing of Generoso Panganiban, and to two <u>death
penalties</u> in Criminal Cases Nos.</span> <span class="GramE">L-438 and L-439
for the killing of Generoso's wife Victoria Gunda and his daughter Anatalia
Panganiban.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Panganiban did not appeal from that decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the two death penalties are under
automatic review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The murder case wherein
reclusion perpetua was imposed is not under auto­matic review</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, only <u>two (2</u>) cases are docketed
in this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third case, the <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u> case (Case No. L-437 in the lower court), was not docketed.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">The branch clerk of court of the trial court in elevating the
records to this Court said in his letter of transmittal that he was forwarding
the records of Criminal Cases Nos. <span class="GramE">L-438 and L-439, where the
death penalty was imposed.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
in this Court two docket numbers were given to the two cases, L-33822 and
L-33823.</p>

<p class="BODY">The branch clerk of court clarified in his letter of trans­mittal
that he had to forward to this Court also the <u>expediente</u>' of Criminal
Case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">No. </span>L-437,
the <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> case, where "no appeal had been
taken", because the papers pertinent to Cri­minal Cases Nos. L-438 and
L-439 are attached to L-437 in view of the joint trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statement in the dispositive part of the majority opinion
that the whole judgment in the <u>three cases</u> rendered by Judge <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is set aside and that Panganiban "is hereby acquitted of the charges
against him in <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">all the <u>three </u></span><u>cases</u>"
is not well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot set aside that portion of the judgment imposing <u>reclusion
perpetua</u> because <u>it is not under review</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>It has long become final and executory
because there was no appeal from that portion of the judgment</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should have been appealed in order to be
reviewed by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the death penalties imposed for the killing of
Victoria Gunda and her daughter Anatalia (Cases Nos. L-438 and L-439), I am of
the opinion that the guilt of Moises Panganiban, as co-conspirator in the
killing of the two victims, was established beyond reasonable doubt by the
testimony of Ernesto Catapang, 20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, I vote for the imposition of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,
not death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The four accused are related to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moises Panga­niban was the son-in-law of
Vicente Suarez who died and was not tried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pedro Suarez was Vicente's son.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pedro Basit and Moises Panganiban married sisters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motive for the killing was the loss of the plow of Gene­roso
Panganiban which came into the possession of Vicente Suarez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Generoso threatened to report the loss of the
plow to the Constabulary.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Moises' alibi, Judge Valencia found that the fact
that Moises was in the law office of Pedro Servano at about noontime on May 5,
1965 did not preclude him from returning within seven hours to Sitio
Kabayagasan, Barrio Port Junction, Ragay to help in the killing of the victims
at seven o'clock in the evening of that day.</p>
