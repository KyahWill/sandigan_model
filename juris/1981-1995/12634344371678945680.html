for reformation of contract, recovery of possession and damages, docketed
therein as Civil Case No. 4,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>alleging,
among others, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"2. That
defendant is in charge of the implementation of the Irrigation Program of the
national government to increase food production nationwide, and in pursuance of
this policy, the Magat River Multi-Purpose Project was undertaken <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to p</span>rovide irrigation in the Cagayan

multi-billion loan from the world <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">bank;
that as an indispensable component of the project, massive infrastructure
improvements such as buildings and the like, were constructed to house the
different offices monitoring the actual implementation of the project;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. That for
the purpose above mentioned, and sometime on June 5, 1975, herein plaintiff and
defendant, thru its Officer-in-Charge, Magat River Multi-Purpose Project (MRMP)

made, entered into a CONTRACT OF LEASE, over plaintiff's urban parcel of land,
more particularly described as follows:</blockquote>

meters, more or less, and forming part of that parcel of land with a total area
of thirty thousand and five (30,005) square maters, more or less, embraced in
TCT <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">No. T-85689 of the land records of

months before the expiration of the ten (10) year period, LESSOR shall request
LESSEE in writing about the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">latter's
final intention on the herein </span>(property) leased; likewise, LESSEE shall
inform LESSOR in writing about LESSEE'S definite intention on the area; failure
of parties to make bilateral communication shall be deemed that this contract is
in force and effect even after the ten (10) year period, <u>as if LESSOR, his
successors, or assigns allowed continued use of the property by LESSEE </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">without any additional compensation

Twenty Five Thousand (P25,000.00) Pesos, the land owner, <u>Estanislao Gamit

xerox copy of the contract is hereto attached as Annex "B", to form
part hereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>5. That prior to
the signing of the contract of lease as stated in the immediately preceding
paragraphs, serious negotiations were made, the first was, when the Municipal
Mayor and Chief of Police of the Municipality of San Manuel, Isabela,
approached plaintiff in behalf of defendant, to allow the latter thru its
Project Manager or his duly authorized representatives and equipments to enter
into and occupy three (3) hectares or 30,000 square meters of his land on which
to establish the Office of Division III, of the Project, and plaintiff and his
wife signed a written permit dated April 24, 1975, witnessed by Mayor Paulino
A. Domingo and Chief of Police Pedro R. Pascua, which permit was granted ‘<u>pending
the perfection of documents pertinent to a </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">formal lease contract with the right to purchase</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">' to be executed by and between plaintiff </span>and
defendant.  Certified xerox copy of the
permit is hereto attached as Annex "B-1", to form part hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That further negotiations followed, and a document denominated as
'AGREEMENT' was prepared by herein defendant for the signature of plaintiff and
the latter and his wife signed the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">same,
with one Engr. Antonio A. Ramos, then the Chief of Division III, MRMP, San
Manuel, Isabela, signing as an instrumental witness; for reasons known only to
the Asst. Project Manager, the document was not however signed by him, for
which reason, the contract of lease was not perfected possibly because
defendant's Assistant Project Manager wanted to prolong plaintiff’s anxiety and
the same was aggravated by the latter's deep financial need, which fact is
known by the Assistant Project Manager during the negotiations, thereby exercising
undue influence or advantage over that </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">plaintiff, when the contract of lease was finally signed on June 6,
1975.  Certified xerox copy of the
unperfected agreement is hereto attached as Annex "B-2", to form part
hereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.  That contemporaneously or subsequently
thereafter and sometime on August 27, 1975 or thereabout, the whole rental of
the leased premises was offered to be paid by the defendant and the plaintiff
being then in need of cash, as he was then in financial distress, accepted the
offer, and finally received the whole amount, as evidenced by a certified xerox
copy of the corresponding voucher, hereto attached as Annex "C", to
form part hereof; </blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.  That only recently, in a letter dated
November 23, 1984, sent by the Assistant Project Manager to the plaintiff,
herein defendant notified the former, of the election to purchase the leased
premises, allegedly in accordance with stipulation No. 8 quoted above, and
contained in the contract of lease (Annex "B").  Certified xerox copy of the same is hereto
attached as Annex "D", to form part hereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.  That the contract of lease entered into, by
and between herein plaintiff and defendant does not express the real agreement
or intention of the parties, as there was error or mistake of fact on the part
of plaintiff, aggravated by his state of financial distress at the time the
contract was signed, and herein defendant acted fraudulently or inequitably,
exercising undue influence over plaintiff on account of the latter's financial
distress, in such a way that their real agreement was not reflected or
expressed in the contract of lease signed by the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.  That the real agreement or intention of the
parties was only for the lease of the twenty five (25,000) thousand square
meters by defendant at the rate of P0.10 centavos per square meter, for a
period of ten (10) years from date of execution with the right of defendant to
purchase the area upon the termination of the lease, on a price certain or
consideration to be negotiated and agreed upon, by and between the parties
after the lapse of the ten (10) year period;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“10. That it was
not the real agreement or intention of the parties, at least that of herein
plaintiff, to have the rentals paid as forming part of the purchase price later
to be negotiated or agreed upon, much less was it their intention at least on
the part of herein plaintiff, that the price shall not exceed P25,000.00 (see
stipulation No. 4, Lease of Contract), otherwise, there will be a gross
inadequacy of the purchase price, enough to shock the conscience of man and
that of the court; that it was not also the intention or agreement of the
parties, at least that of herein plaintiff, that in case the lease contract is
not renewed after the lapse of the ten (10) year period, for failure of the
parties to make bilateral communication, the lessor or his successors or
assigns are deemed to have allowed continued use of the land in suit without
any additional compensation whatsoever (see stipulation no. 8, contract of
lease) and neither was it the true agreement or real intention of the parties,
at least on the part of herein plaintiff, that upon payment of the rental
amount of P25,000.00, herein plaintiff shall be deemed to have conveyed and
ceded all his rights and interest on the subject property, in favor of herein
defenant.  (see stipulation No. 9);</blockquote>

<blockquote>“11. That herein
defendant acted fraudulent­ly and inequitably, taking advantage of the
financial distress of herein plaintiff, when it caused the unlawful insertion
of the stipulation contained in paragraphs 4, 8 and 9 quoted above, in the
contract of lease, and the same are all contrary to law and void <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ab-initio</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">, </span>because the fixing of the price of the land to be purchased
can never be left to the discretion or will of one of the contracting parties;
and in this case, it was defendant alone who determined the price and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">if </span>this is so, then the validity or
com­pliance of the contract can not be demanded by herein defendant, for the
reason that a contract of sale, is essentially bilateral in character;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“12. That
evidently, the contract as drafted and prepared by herein defendant for the
signa­ture of herein plaintiff is a contract commonly known as ADHESION
CONTRACT, which is one where one party (plaintiff herein) merely signs care­fully
prepared contracts of big companies, such as contracts of insurance,
construction and the like; as in the case of herein defendant where the project
involves multi-billion contracts funded from the World Bank, thus, the same
should be strictly interpreted against defendant, and liberally in favor of
herein plaintiff, because the latter was virtually helpless to bargain for
better terms on account of his financial need at the time;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“13. That the fair
and reasonable price or market value of the land in suit which is an urban land
located at the Poblacion or Centro of the town of San Manuel, this province, is
no less than Fifty Pesos (P50.00) per square meter, and plaintiff makes this
offer, subject to the acceptance of herein defendant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“14. That as
agreed upon, the area to be leased is only twenty five (25,000) thousand square
meters, as evidenced by the encumbrance registered at the back of TCT No.
T-85689, in the name of plaintiff leaving a portion of five (5,000) thousand
square meters, as free from the lien and encumbrance;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“15. That after
the lease contract was executed and registered, herein defendant fenced the
area leased, but in the process, the latter stealthily and surreptitiously
expanded its occupation and it included the remaining portion of five (5,000)
thousand square meters, unencumbered, as evidenced by a relocation survey
conducted by one Geodetic Engineer Apolinar P. Alvarez in the premises, a blue
print copy of the sketch map is hereto attached as Annex "E" to form
part hereof, and the xerox copy of the letter of plaintiff dated August 27,
1984, addressed to the Manager of Division III, Magat River Multi-Purpose
Project, San Manuel, Isabela, requesting for a relocation of the leased
premises, is hereto attached as Annex "E-1", to form part hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“16. That the
encroached area of five (5,000) thousand square meters which is irrigated, can
be easily planted to palay and would yield an average of no less than one (100)
hundred cavans of palay at 46 kilos per cavan, per crop, for three (3)
croppings a year, with a selling price of P3.50 per kilo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“17. That herein
plaintiff failed to realize the expected income stated in the immediately
preceding paragraph due to the unlawful occupation of the area by defendant
since the year 1975 to the present, and despite repeated demands, the defendant
refuses to deliver the possession of the encroached portion of 5,000 square
meters to the plaintiff, with accounting of its corresponding produce, up to
the present; however, should defendant desires to purchase the remaining
portion of 5,000 square meters, plaintiff offers a price of no less than P50.00
per square meter which is the fair and reasonable market value of the land;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“18. That due to
the unlawful, inequitable and malicious actuations of herein defendant,
plaintiff was forced to engage the services of counsel for a contingent fee of
30% of whatever is due plaintiff, plus P300.00 as appearance fee, for the
protection, respect, and preservation of his rights and interests in the
premises; </blockquote>

<blockquote>“19.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>That likewise, for the fraudulent and
inequitable acts committed by defendant, plain­tiff is entitled to actual or
compensatory damages representing unrealized income of the 5,000 square meters
encroached portion, which is estimated to be no less than 25 cavans of palay
(25% of 100 as rental per crop, for three (3) croppings a year), or a total of
75 cavans per year and/or a grand total of 750 cavans of palay at 46 kilos per
cavan for ten (10) years, at the current price of P3.50 per kilo; and entitled
to nominal or temperate damages in the sum of P30,000.00 plus moral and
exemplary damages of no less than P60,000.00 for the public good;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully
prayed of this Honorable Court that judgment be rendered in favor of your
plaintiff and against herein defendant by:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.  Ordering, that the contract of lease with
right to purchase (Annex "B") be reformed, so that the real and true
agreement or intention of the parties be reflected and/or expressed therein;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  In the alternative, should the defendant
pursue to BUY the land in suit (30,000 square meters) at a price certain agreed
upon by the parties after serious negotiations at the rate of P50.00 per square
meter, then the necessary and proper document be drawn and prepared, under the
strict supervision of the Court, and the corres­ponding purchase price or
compensation to be paid by defendant, be deposited with the court under <u>custodia
legis</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. Ordering the
defendant to pay plaintiff, the unrealized income or profit, plaintiff
suffered, by virtue of the unlawful occupation by defendant of the remaining
portion of 5,000 square meters from 1975 to the present or until possession is

and the sum of P60,000.00, by way of moral and exemplary damages, for the
public good, plus attorney's fees on a contingent basis of 30%, depending on
the amount finally adjudicated in favor of plaintiff, plus appearance fee of
P300.00 when the case is called <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for </span>hearing
or for any other purpose;</blockquote>

continuation of their relationship and the lease contract ordered terminated,
and/or, should the defendant elects not to purchase the whole 30,000 square
meters, defendant be ordered to deliver the possession of the land in suit to
the plaintiff, and the defendant allowed to remove the infrastructure
improvements introduced on the land, with right of retention to the
former;"</blockquote>

denies the rest of the allegation therein, more specifically that plaintiff's
land is urban land, the fact of the matter being that it is riceland at the
time NIA took possession of the same;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The parties are not ordinary parties to a contract and the
court is of the opinion, that they intended their contract to be a contract of
lea<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">s</span>e not sale.  If it were otherwise, the party could have
denominated their contract a deed of sale not a contract of lease with right to
purchase.  If the parties intended to
execute a contract of sale over the two and one-half hectares they should have
executed a deed of sale and not a contract of lease.  The plaintiff much less the defendant could not claim ignorance
of the con­tract executed by them because the latter is represented by a
battery of corporate counsel aside from the office of the Solicitor General and
a project Manager whose educational qualifi­cation is above an ordinary citizen
or individual.  The court cannot
therefore sustain the contention of the defendant that the contract entered
into is that of sale and hereby holds that it is a lease <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contract </span>with the right to purchase
not sale.  The mere fact that there is a
period agreed upon by the parties which is ten (10) years from June 6, 1975 to
June 6, 1985 clearly indicate that the contract between them is a lease
contract not sale.  A contract of sale
does not have any period because it is final and absolute.  Likewise, the contract cannot be deemed to
be that of sale because the defendant is given the option to buy and if the
latter chooses to buy the land in question the price should be that which has
already been paid the plaintiff as the consideration of the lease which was
paid in advance in the amount of P25,000.00.  The option to buy is not embodied in a contract of sale but it is a term
which maybe agreed upon in a contract of lease.  The agreement of the parties that the P25,000.00 paid in full to
the plaintiff to be the purchase <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">price</span>
of the two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>one-half hectares
however, cannot be considered as the consideration for purposes of the option
to buy of the defendant for the reason that the said amount was paid to the
plaintiff as rentals for the use of the property during the period of ten (10)
years when the option to buy of the de­fendant is not yet being exercised by
the latter otherwise it will be considered as pactum commissorium which in the
eyes of the law is illegal per se.  To
hold otherwise, would deprived the plaintiff the reasonable rentals of the two
and one-half hectares during the duration of the lease contract because then
the P25,000.00 would be considered as advance payment of the land.  x x x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x.  Hence, there
is no need to reform the agreement.  First, because it has already expired and second, the contract is very
clear that it is only a contract of lease with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

its option to buy the amount of P25,000.00 paid as rental should be considered

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the complaint at bar and the relief prayed for

Articles 1359 and 1362<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> of

<blockquote>"8.  That the contract of lease entered into, by
and between herein plaintiff and defendant does not express the real agreement
or intention of the parties, as there was error or mistake of fact on the part
of plaintiff, aggravated by his state of financial distress at the time the
contract <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>signed, and herein
defendant acted fraudulently or inequitably, exercising undue influence over
plaintiff on account of the latter's financial distress, in such a way that
their real agreement was not reflected or expressed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"9.  That the real agreement or intention of the
parties was only for the lease of the twenty five (25,000) thousand square
meters, by defend­ant at the rate of P0.10 centavos per square meter, for a
period of ten (10) years from date of execution with the right of defendant to

period;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10. That it
was not the real agreement or intention of the parties, at least that of herein
plaintiff, to have the rentals paid as forming part of the purchase price later

the part of herein plaintiff, that the price shall not exceed P25,000.00 (see
stipulation No. 4, Lease of Contract), otherwise, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

shock the conscience of man and that of the court; that it was not also the
intention or agreement of the parties, at least that of herein plaintiff, that
in case the lease contract is not renewed after the lapse of the ten (10) year
period, for failure of the parties to make bilateral communication, the lessor
or his successors or assigns are deemed to have allowed continued use of the
land in suit without any additional compensation whatsoever (see stipulation
no. 8, contract of lease) and neither was it the true agreement or real
intention of the parties, at least on the part of herein plaintiff, that upon
payment of the rental amount of P25,000.00, herein plaintiff shall be deemed to
have conveyed and ceded all his rights and interest on the subject property, in

because the fixing of the price of the land to be purchased can never be left
to the discretion or will of one of the contracting parties; and in this case,
it was defendant alone who determined the price and if this is so, then the
validity or compliance of the  contract
can not be demanded by herein defendant, for the reason that contract of sale,
is essentially bilateral in character;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">and prays, among others, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1. Ordering,
that the contract of lease with right to purchase (Annex "B") be reformed,
so that the real and true agreement or intention of the parties be reflected
and/or expressed therein;”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Otherwise stated, the complaint at bar alleges that the contract
of lease with right to purchase does not express the true intention and
agreement of the parties thereto due to mistake on the part of the plaintiff

by unlawfully inserting the stipulations contained in paragraphs 4, 8 and 9 in
said contract of lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, parol evidence is not admissible for the
purpose of varying the terms of a contract.  However, when the issue that a contract does not express the inten­tion
of the parties and the proper foundation is laid therefor -- as in the present
case -- the court should hear the evidence for the purpose of ascertaining the
true intention of the parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing premises, we hold that the trial court erred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>holding that the issue in this case
is a question of law and not a question of fact because it merely involves the
interpretation of the contract between the parties.  The lower court erred in not conducting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a </span>trial for the purpose of determining the true intention of the
parties.  It failed to appreciate the
distinction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">between </span>interpretation
and reformation of contracts.  While the
aim in interpretation of contracts is to ascertain the true intention of the
parties, interpretation is not, however, equivalent to reformation of
contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Interpretation" is the act of making intelligible what
was before not understood, ambiguous, or not obvious.  It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>method by
which the meaning of language is ascertained.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> The
"interpretation" of a contract is the determination of the meaning

which a written instrument is made or construed so as to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">express </span>or conform to the real
intention of the parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>In granting reformation, therefore,

Article 1362 of the Civil Code, provides:  "If one party was mistaken and the other acted fraudulently or
inequitably in such a way that the instrument does not show their true
intention, the former may ask for the reformation of the instrument.  In <u>Ong Chua <i>vs</i>. Carr, et al</u>., this
Court held that reformation will be given "where there is a mistake on one
side and fraud or unfair dealing on the other." (53 Phil. 975).</p>
