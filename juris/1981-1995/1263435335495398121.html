(Branch 169, Malabon) in Criminal Case No. 8197-MN, for Violation of Section 4,

<p class="BODY">The case for the prosecution, as summarized by the Solicitor
General, is as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Three (3) weeks before August 20, 1989, Pfc. Roberto Dayag, Pat. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Rizalino Francisco </span>and Pat. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Nemesio Era, all </span>of the Anti-Narcotics
Unit of the Navotas Police Station, conducted a surveillance on appellant to
confirm a confidential information that he was engaged in selling <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">marijuana at Roldan Street, </span>Tangos,
Navotas, Metro Manila (TSN, March <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6, </span>1990,
pp. 2-3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having confirmed that appellant was a "drug pusher," a
buy-bust operation was hatched by Pfc. Dayag, Pat. Francisco, Pat. Era and
P/Cpl. Rolando Mabbun (TSN, March 13, 1990, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">pp. </span>9-10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On August 20, 1989, at around 2:30 o'clock <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>the afternoon, Pat. Dayag, Pat. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Era and P/Cpl. Mabbun </span>hid themselves inside <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a sari-sari </span>store five (5) to eight
(8) meters away from the corner of Roldan Street, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Navotas, </span>Metro Manila.  Then, Pat. Francisco, as poseur-buyer, approached appellant who was
standing at the corner of Roldan Street and told the latter that he (Pat.
Francisco) wanted to buy “marijuana.” Appellant informed Pat. Francisco that
one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(1) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">tea bag of marijuana cost Ten Pesos (P10.00) [TSN, March 6, 1990, pp. </span>3-5;
TSN, March 13, 1990, p. 9].</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pat. Francisco then handed to appellant a marked Fifty Peso
(P50.00) bill (Exh. G).  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">In </span>turn, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">appellant gave </span>Pat. Francisco five (5) <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<blockquote>Whereupon, Pat. Francisco disclosed himself to appellant as a
police officer.  At this point, Pfc.
Dayag, Pat. Era and P/Cpl. Mabbun came out from the store and apprehended
appellant.  The latter voluntarily
returned the P50.00 marked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">money </span>to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Pat. Francisco (TSN, Mar. 6, 1990, p.
5).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant was brought to the Navotas Police Station for
investigation.  Thereat, a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">ppellant </span>surrendered another five (5)
tea <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">bags of marijuana (TSN, March 13,
1990, p. 8).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon the request of P/Cpl. Mabbun (Rec., Vol. II, p. 1), the
National Bureau of Investigation conducted chemical, microscopic and
chromatographic examinations of the contents of the ten (10) tea bags <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">forwarded to it for laboratory tests.  The contents of the ten (10) tea bags were
found to be "marijuana" (TSN, Feb. 27, 1990, pp. 1-6; Exhs. D &amp;
E).  (pp. 55-58, Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, accused-appellant Alejandro Esguerra proferred a
different story and denied the buy-bust operation as narrated above.  Interposing alibi as a defense, he testified
that on the afternoon of August 20, 1989, he was in his parents' house at No. 4
Leongson Street, San Roque, Navotas to ask for money from his mother,
Purificasion Seminiano, in order to buy milk for his child.  Upon receipt of the money, he boarded a
tricycle and went to Tangos, Navotas but he was not able to return to his house
as he was apprehended by P/Cpl. Roland Mabbun who informed him that a case was
filed against him.  Later on, he was
incarcerated at the Navotas Municipal Jail by Pfc Roberto Dayag and P/Cpl.
Mabbun.  He denied the testimony of Pat.
Rizalito Francisco concerning the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">P50.00
taken from him, </span>saying that the same was given <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">to </span>him by his mother.  On
cross-examination, he admitted that he was arrested by P/Cpl. Roland Mabbun, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Pfc </span>Roberto Dayag, and Pat. Rizalito
Francisco and that he was brought to the Navotas Police Station after his
arrest (p. 12, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Rollo).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>for proper disposition.  (p. 14,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Dissatisfied, </span>accused-appellant
interposed the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">appeal, arguing </span>that
the trial court erred in <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">giving </span>more
weight to the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution and consequently
further erred in finding him guilty of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's defense is anchored on the circumstance that
5 other marijuana tea bags were recovered or taken from his possession not at
the time of his arrest, but when he was already at the police station.  He reasons thus:  The normal and standard procedure followed by police officers in
the arrest of offenders is to frisk and search the persons of the violators for
weapons or evidence during or immediately after the arrest.  Assuming that there was a buy-bust operation
and further assuming that he had the 5 marijuana tea bags subject of the sale,
then, accused-appellant continues, when he was arrested, and following the
standard procedure, he should have been frisked which would then have resulted
in the discovery of the 5 other marijuana tea bags.  As those other 5 tea bags were discovered only at the police
station, accused-appellant concludes (a) there was no buy-bust operation and
(b) the P50.00 and the 10 marijuana tea bags are planted evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's manner of reaching his conclusions is
flawed.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">A number </span>of causes may exist why no immediate body search of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">suspected offender is done </span>in any particular
arrest.  The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">most obvious, we suppose, is lack of proper training on the part of the
arresting officer or officers.  It could
also </span>happen that the arresting officers may conclude that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">offender poses no danger and </span>that it
would be best to defer to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>later
time a more thorough body search to be conducted in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the </span>presence of witnesses thus obviating any later charge o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">f</span> evidence-planting.  This was what probably happened <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">case.  As </span>the Solicitor
General correctly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">points </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">out, accused-appellant did not pose an
imminent danger to </span>the law enforcers because he was clearly outnumbered
by the policemen.  It may not be amiss
then to conclude that there was no need to frisk accused-appellant for any
hidden weapon o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">r </span>other
evidence.  What <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is </span>significant is that accused-appellant was caught red-handed
in the act of selling the prohibited item.  The prosecution has proven with certainty all the elements necessary for
a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">charge </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">of illegal sale </span>of marijuana which are:  (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and
consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(<u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Rumeral</u>, </span>200
SCRA 194 [1991]).  Suffice it to say
that there was no need for the policemen to concoct a story with regard to the
other 5 marijuana tea bags recovered at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">police s</span>tation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant further contends that <span style="color:windowtext">because</span>
he and the poseur-buyer had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not </span>previously
met, it would have been foolhardy for him to fearlessly enter into an illegal
transaction with a complete stranger (p. 36, Rollo).  The argument is baseless.  It is a well-settled rule in this jurisdiction that what matters is not
the existing familiarity between the buyer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">and </span>the drug user, but rather the agreement and the acts
constituting sale and delivery (<u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Fernandez</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">, 209 SCRA 1 [1992]; <u>People</u> </span><u>v.</u> <u>Mendoza</u>, G.R. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">No. 92387, Dec. 18, </span>1992).  In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">People</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><u>v</u>.
<u>Rumeral</u> (200 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">SCRA 194 [1991]),
this Court held that drug pushers, </span>especially small quantity <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or retail </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">pushers </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">sell </span>their prohibited wares to anyone <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">who </span>has the price for the drug, be they strangers or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Credibility-wise, we are inclined to believe the testimony of the
poseur-buyer, Pat. Rizalito <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Francisco.  </span>His testimony was corroborated on
most material points by P/Cpl. Roland Mabbun who testified that, together with
Pat. Nemesio Era and Pfc. Roberto Dayag, he witnessed the illegal transaction
from a certain place near Pat. Rizalito Francisco <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">(p. 11, Rollo).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">On </span>the other hand,
the defense of alibi and frame-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">up </span>is
not persuasive.  The testimony of the
lone witness Purificasion Seminiano, mother of accused-<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">appellant, does </span>not inspire belief, the mother instinct to protect
a child <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">being obvious.  Her testimony was </span>not buttressed by
any other evidence.  The defense theory <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">bears </span>the badges of a concoction easy
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">formulate but hard to prove (<u>People</u>
<u>v</u>. <u>Acuram</u>, 209 </span>SCRA 407 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">[1992]).  Moreover,
accused-appellant failed </span>to explain the presence of the marks
"RIZ" and "RCM" <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(the
initials of Pat. Rizalito Francisco and Pat. </span>Roland Mabbun,
respectively) on the P50 bill (Exhs. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">G </span>and
G-2, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Original Records).  As between the positive </span>declarations
of the prosecution witnesses and the negative statement of the accused, the
former deserves more credence (<u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Doctolero,</u> 193
SCRA 632 [1991]).  We recognize the rule
that generally, when an appeal hinges on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">credibility </span>of witnesses, the
assessment by the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">court is accorded </span>highest respect (<u>Mendoza</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>, 198 SCRA 312 [1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the positive identification of accused-appeIlant by
the prosecution witnesses, We sustain the finding of the trial court that
herein accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  Absent a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">showing that t</span>he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">law </span>enforcers
were moved by ill-motive or improper reason to falsely impute a serious c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">harge</span>
against the accused, it is presumed that they have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">acted in the </span>regular performance of
their duty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed
