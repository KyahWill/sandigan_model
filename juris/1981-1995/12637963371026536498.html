in <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1980</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> was shot in the back while driving his
tricycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rushed to the hospital, he
died shortly upon arrival, of severe bleeding from the wounds he had
sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of the same
day, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span> was
picked up at his residence and thereafter investigated for the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was subsequently charged with the murder
of <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> and convicted after trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
sentencing him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
and to pay the victim's heirs P14,000.00 indemnity plus P3,000.00 for burial
expenses and P10,000.00 as moral damages is now before us on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the doctor who testified on the results of the
autopsy he conducted on the victim, four witnesses were presented by the
prosecution to prove <span class="SpellE">Sequerra's</span> guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The most important of these was Rowena <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span>, a 15-year old girl, who was the victim's passenger
when he was shot that fatal morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to her, the tricycle had just passed by the accused, who was
standing along the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> road, when he fired at
the victim and then immediately ran towards the fields, still carrying his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Terrified, she jumped from the tricycle and started shouting that her
uncle had been shot by <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span>.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This testimony was corroborated by Carolina <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span>,
her stepmother, who declared that she had been brought that morning by <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> in his tricycle to her house from the market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">way,
</span>they had passed the accused standing in front of a neighbor's
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding that she had left some of
her purchases behind, she asked Rowena to go back <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
19.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the tricycle and
fetch them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a few minutes later,
while she was about to enter her house that she heard a gunshot and looked in
the direction of the sound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From where
she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">standing, about 30 meters from the tricycle,
she saw the accused running toward the fields after apparently having shot <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span>.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear from the declaration of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barsuela</span>, another prosecution witness, that <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> was still able to walk after he was shot for she
found him in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her front yard lying face
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She immediately went to give him
assistance and asked him who had shot him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to her, he thrice identified his assailant as "Danny <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span>."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span>, the victim's wife,
testified about the civil damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
also declared there was bad blood between her husband and the accused because
the latter resented <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonete's</span>
acquittal of the murder of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">relative
of <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span>; her husband had discovered <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span> </span>stealing chickens; and <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span>
had stoned their house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, the accused claimed he was not in <span class="SpellE">Calaba</span> at the time of the killing, being then in a bus
bound for <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, where he arrived at <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1980</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
By then, the crime had already been committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In corroboration, his sister, Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span>,
testified that she had gone with him to the Philippine Rabbit Bus terminal in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="7">7:30 a.m.</st1:time> on that date, and
seen him off as he boarded the bus for <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before he left, she said, the accused had
stayed with her at her brother-in-law's house in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>

<p class="BODY">Another witness for the defense was Domingo <span class="SpellE">Gapuz</span>,
the driver of the bus the accused claimed to have taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gapuz</span> swore he
talked to <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span> at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 a.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1980</st1:date>, when his bus stopped over at <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Tarlac</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, and even invited him to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">take </span>coffee with him.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span> himself testified in his
behalf and averred that in February 1980, after the town fiesta of <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, he went to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he stayed at the house of his brother-in-law with his student sister,
Cecilia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There he remained until March
31, 1980, when at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8 o'clock</st1:time> in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">morning, he boarded </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

him off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
he had a snack with Domingo <span class="SpellE">Gapuz</span>, the driver </span>of
the bus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He arrived in <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span> at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon and proceeded to his house where, being
tired, he lay in his bed to rest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
soon afterwards that policemen arrived to place him under arrest on suspicion
of the murder of <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He remonstrated that he had just returned
from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> but they nevertheless
brought him to the municipal building, and then to the NBI Office in <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
where he was fingerprinted and paraffin-tested.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The decision of this case
hangs mainly on the credibility </span>of the witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This matter in turn depends heavily on the
impressions of the trial judge, who had the opportunity to observe their
demeanor on the stand and distinguish by their conduct between fact and
fabrication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there is no clear
showing that he has committed a grave abuse of discretion in arriving at his
judgment, we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">shall </span>sustain him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime was committed in broad daylight, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, in a quiet and
uncluttered place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the witnesses
for the prosecution, Rowena <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span>, was actually
riding in the tricycle driven by the victim when he was shot only <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>few meters after they had passed
the latter, who was standing by the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The other witness, Carolina <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span>, who heard
the shot and looked on the scene of the crime was only 30 meters <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">away </span>and had a clear view of what was
happening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were no other persons
in the vicinity except the killer and his victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, both these witnesses knew the
accused well and categorically identified him <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>the killer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
could not have been, in the circumstances, any possibility of mistaken
identity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for witness <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Barsuela</span>, she was also
positive in pointing to the accused as the person whom the victim identified as
the person who had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">shot him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said the victim mentioned the defendant's
name thrice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused claims he <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">was </span>not in <span class="SpellE">Calaba</span> when the killing
occurred, being then in <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">having </span>coffee at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 a.m.</st1:time> with the driver of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>bus taking him to <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Gapuz</span> affirms <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">this,
and </span>so in effect <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">does Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span>, who </span>testified that she saw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">her </span>brother off at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>terminal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

morning of <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense also stresses that the result of
the paraffin test <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>negative,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
suggesting that <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span> could not have fired the
fatal shot even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">if </span>it be assumed
that he was in <span class="SpellE">Calaba</span> in the morning of March 31,
1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is an inherently weak defense and is not accepted in the absence
of a clear showing that the accused was not, nor could he feasibly have been,
at the scene of the crime when it was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the defense is based mainly on <span class="SpellE">Sequerra's</span> own self-serving testimony and with rather
feeble corroboration at that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This corroboration
<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is also </span>testimonial only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>single shred of documentary evidence to prove that the accused
was many kilometers away from <span class="SpellE">Calaba</span> when the victim
was shot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span> on
behalf of her brother is understandable as a manifestation of sibling loyalty
and is for that reason also suspect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
for <span class="SpellE">Gapuz's</span> own declaration, a reading thereof shows
it is flawed with inconsistencies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Testifying on direct examination that the accused boarded his bus on <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1980</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

he contradicted himself on cross and said the date was <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1981</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and then even went further to say that the accused never rode in his bus on <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1980</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also notes that although defense witness <span class="SpellE">Onesimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paa</span> disclaimed expertise
on paraffin-testing, being assigned at the NBI as fingerprint examiner, he was
nonetheless questioned without objection on the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified that the negative result thereof
might be due to the use of gloves by the person who fired the shot or of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">chemicals that can prevent deposit or
detection of nitrate </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the said test.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Carolina <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> is the wife of <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonete's</span> brother,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and Rowena <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> is her stepdaughter and the
victim's niece.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The defense claims that the relationship with the victim <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">makes </span>them biased and perjured wit<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">nesses </span>whose testimony could not be
relied upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same charge is made
against <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Barsuela</span>,
although she testified that while related to the deceased, her relationship
with the accused was in fact closer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused also said <span class="SpellE">Barsuela</span> held a grudge against
him because she suspected him of complicity in the killing of her brother.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It did not appear to the trial court that such circumstances had
vitiated or falsified their testimony; and there is no indication either that
they had conspired to testify against the accused out of spite for him or for
some other dubious purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, each of them had her own story to tell, and what is more, these
stories jibed with each other to point a common finger at <span class="SpellE">Sequerra</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is just one curious item in Carolina <span class="SpellE">Bonete's</span>
narration, and this is her declaration that upon hearing the shot and seeing
the accused fleeing from the scene of the crime, what she did was to
immediately go to Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> to inform her that
her husband had been shot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Carmelita confirms this.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Strangely, what they did next was to report the matter to the PC authorities
without first going to the fallen victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was only later that they inquired about him and were told that he had
died in the hospital.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is unnatural behavior, to say the least, considering that
Carmelita was the wife of the victim and <st1:city><st1:place>Carolina</st1:place></st1:city>
his sister-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The normal impulse in
such a situation would have been to go to the victim to find out how he was, if
he was still alive or already dead, and to help him if it was not yet too late.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, what these women did was to
immediately report the crime, ignoring the man who was bleeding to death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The only possible
explanation for this unseemly conduct is that these women panicked and so acted
</span>irrationally.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This should account
for their apparent lack of anxiety over the stricken <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonete</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>he
lay dying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any case, as the Court
sees it, this odd behavior, which neither of them denies, does not detract from
but, indeed, by its very imperfection, strengthens the veracity of their
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the trial judge did not err in giving
credence to the witnesses for the prosecution and in finding the accused guilty
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Against his
positive identification, all he offered was the feeble defense of alibi, which
he and his witnesses failed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
substantiate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is condemned, of
course, not because he failed to prove that he was in <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
but because the prosecution succeeded in proving that he was in <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Confronted by the full panoply of state authority, the accused is
accorded the presumption of innocence to lighten and even reverse the heavy
odds against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere accusation is not
enough to convict him, and neither is the weakness of his defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence for the prosecution must be
strong <u>per</u> <u>se</u>, strong enough to establish the guilt of the
accused beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, he is entitled to be freed.</p>

<p class="BODY">But as solicitous as the Bill of Rights is of the accused, the
presumption of innocence is not an automatic or blanket exoneration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is at best only an initial protection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the prosecution succeeds in refuting the
presumption, it then becomes the outlook of the accused to adduce evidence that
will at least raise that inkling of doubt that he is guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once the armor of the presumption is pierced,
so to speak, it is for the accused to take the offensive and ward off the
attack.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attack has not been repelled in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has disarmed and vanquished the accused
and his guilt has been laid bare.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
face of the weighty evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">against
him, his invocation of the constitutional </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
