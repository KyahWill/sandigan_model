<span>y </span><span class="SpellE">Condayan</span>, who was subsequently included 
with the two aforesaid accused in an amended complaint, because of his refusal 
to testify in behalf of the complainant (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 
90) was acquitted by the trial court, finding no convincing evidence to show his 
participation in the commission of the crime.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 77, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, as found by the trial court, are briefly as 
follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">On January 16, 1970, complainant, <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Elus</span>, then a fifteen 
(15) year old country lass, was staying in the boarding house of Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Mahoy</span> located at <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuk</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kalinga-Apayao</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 60, 66).<span>&nbsp; </span>At about 2:00 o'clock in 
the afternoon of that day, while complainant was conversing with her <span class="SpellE">boardmates</span>, her third degree cousin, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span>, arrived and told 
her to go home to <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span> because her mother was sick 
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 66-67).<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> also informed her 
that he will fetch her later<span> that same afternoon 
(<em>ibid.</em>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time hour="16" minute="0">4:00 oâ€™clock</st1:time> 
in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span>, together with <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lingbawan</span> came to 
fetch the complainant in her boarding house (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., 
p. 68).<span>&nbsp; </span>She <span>asked permission from Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Mahoy</span> to go home and requested <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Omang</span>, her <span class="SpellE">boardmate</span>, to accompany her (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 68-69).<span>&nbsp; </span>They then rode on a 
passenger jeep owned and driven by <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The latter stopped the jeep by the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> 
Station to load some cargoes, and from there, they went towards the 
market.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the market place, <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> 
told <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Omang</span> not to go 
with them because <span class="SpellE">Emilia's</span> father might scold 
her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Leaving <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Omang</span> behind, they proceeded towards <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 
69-70).<span>&nbsp; </span>Somewhere at <span class="SpellE">Bulanao</span>, they 
passed by the boarding house of Sylvia <span class="SpellE">Bongawen</span>, a 
niece of <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span>, whom they said will be the 
complainant's companion, but Sylvia was not there.<span>&nbsp; </span>They continued 
their journey and somewhere at barrio <span class="SpellE">Tuga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tabuk</span>, the jeep stopped because of some alleged 
defects.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> offered her a bottle of <span class="SpellE">Tru</span>-Orange and biscuits, respectively.<span>&nbsp; </span>They 
stopped at said place for thirty minutes, after which they again continued their 
trip.<span>&nbsp; </span>At barrio <span class="SpellE">Camcamalog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span>, the jeep stopped again because of what they 
claimed to be another defect.<span>&nbsp; </span>They told the complainant to go down 
and as soon as she alighted, <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> held her two 
hands and dragged her away, saying to her that he would tell her something 
(<em>ibid.</em>).<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> then started 
kissing her, mashing her breast and holding her nipples (<em>ibid.</em>).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The complainant cried and shouted for help and ran towards <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span>, who instead of helping <span class="GramE">her,</span> did just what</span><span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Paganao</span></span><span> had done (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 71-72).<span>&nbsp; </span>After this incident, they 
continued their trip but the jeep again stopped somewhere below the ranch of 
Engineer Marana.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was again the excuse of another 
defect.<span>&nbsp; </span>There she was told once more to alight and <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> approached her and held </span>her hands and dragged 
her away from the jeep.<span>&nbsp; </span>She stumbled and <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> started kissing her and at the same time mashed her 
breasts.<span>&nbsp; </span>The complainant pleaded to <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> not to molest her, they being relatives, but the 
latter bluntly replied, "<span class="GramE">whatever</span> you do you are mine 
tonight" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 73-74).<span>&nbsp; </span>When the 
complainant was able to free herself from the hold of <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> met her, and 
again, she was subjected to indignities by <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>When she was able to free herself, 
she went to sit at the back seat of the jeep but <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> pursued her, <span class="GramE">then</span> boxed 
her in the stomach, rendering her unconscious.<span>&nbsp; </span>When she came to 
her senses, <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> was on top of her and was having 
sexual intercourse with her.<span>&nbsp; </span>She pushed and kicked <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> but she was too weak to put up a strong 
resistance.<span>&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, she noticed that her panty was below her 
knees.<span>&nbsp; </span>All this time, <span class="SpellE"><span>Pagan</span>ao</span> and<span> </span><span class="SpellE">Lingbawan</span> were keeping watch at the back of the jeep that 
was parked on the road (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span>pp. 
75-76).<span>&nbsp; </span>Having consummated his lustful desire, <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> called <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lingbawan</span> and they then proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The complainant was dropped at the 
house of Mary <span class="SpellE">Bonggawon</span> where she spent the 
night.<span>&nbsp; </span>The following morning, she went out to urinate and noticed 
blood in her panty and felt pains in her stomach.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she 
requested one of her <span class="SpellE">townmates</span> to look for her brother 
to whom she later related the sordid incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>They then reported 
the matter to the police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On January 19, 1970, the complainant submitted 
her</span>self for physical examination to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> Fernando, Provincial Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Kalinga-Apayao</span> Province, who reduced his findings in writing 
(Exhibit "A"), to wit:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) Swelling and marked reddening with 
<span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> of the vaginal orifice; (b) Wound, lacerated, 
<span class="SpellE">fourchette</span>, vaginal orifice; (c) Hymen completely 
lacerated with oozing of small amount of blood; and (d) non-presence of 
spermatozoa.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In his defense, appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> declared that it was only he and <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> who fetched the complainant at 4:00 P.M. of January 
16, 1970; that <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> alighted at <span class="SpellE">Bulanao</span> and it was only he (<span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span>) with the complainant and his niece Sylvia <span class="SpellE">Bongawen</span> (whom they passed by at <span class="SpellE">Bulanao</span>) who proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span>; that he did not box the complainant, and did not 
have sexual intercourse with her, as she was seated in front of the jeep with 
</span>his niece, and there was no space at the back seat of the jeep which was 
then full of baggage; that he dropped the complainant and his niece before the 
crossing at the <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span> junction; and that he 
proceeded to the junction where he slept alone in his jeep.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> also testified that the complainant had already 
been his sweetheart for around one year prior to January 16, 1970; that he had 
had numerous instances of sexual intercourse with her; and that <span class="GramE">said</span> complainant charged him in court because he did not 
accede to her request that he divorce his wife so he could marry her.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> put up 
alibi as his de</span>fense, claiming that he went to <span class="SpellE">Tabuk</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kalinga-Apayao</span> t<span>o 
have his appointment renewed as provincial <span class="SpellE"><em>caminero</em></span>; </span>that at about 4:00 o'clock p.m. of 
January 16, 1970, he boarded the jeep of <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> 
which was then leaving <span class="SpellE">Tabuk</span> for the provincial 
capital of <span class="SpellE">Bulanao</span>; that they fetched the complainant 
from her boarding house because earlier that day, the latter (whom he met near 
the school) told him to tell <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> to pick her up 
as she was going on a vacation; that he never told the complainant that her 
mother was <span>sick; </span>that on reaching <span class="SpellE">Bulanao</span>, he alighted to see the provincial governor, while 
<span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> and the complainant proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span>; that he failed to see the governor because he 
found out later that the latter was in Manila; and that he proceeded to the 
house of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Gunnawa</span> where he slept that night.</p>
<p class="BODY">Finding the clear and positive testimony of the complainant 
credible, the trial court convicted the accused-appellants <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> as charged, 
and sentenced them to death.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The issue, therefore, rests on credibility, and after a 
careful review of the evidence on record, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no 
plausible reason to hold otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The complainant's categorical and straightforward testimony, 
narrating the sequence of events that transpired and the behavior of the 
appellants from the time they fetched her <span>in </span>her boarding house in 
<span class="SpellE">Tabuk</span>, up to the time they reached <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span>, is logical, probable and has the earmarks of 
truth.</p>
<p class="BODY">The complainant's testimony, which was partially corroborated by 
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Mahoy</span> (the landlady of the boarding house) and 
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Obal</span> (a <span class="SpellE">boardmate</span> of 
the complainant), <span>clearly established that she was fetched by the 
appellants at 4:00 o'clock that afternoon, and that she was molested by them on 
their way to <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said prosecution 
witnesses positively identified the appellant, whom they already knew very well 
before the incident, because appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano's</span> 
nieces were staying in the same boarding house, (p. 12, TSN) and appellant <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> is witness Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Obal's</span> 
second cousin (p. 54, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Likewise, the findings of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> 
Fernando, the examining physician, corroborated the testimony of the complainant 
that she had been sexually abused on that fateful night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">There is no evidence to show that the complainant and the 
aforesaid prosecution witnesses were actuated by any evil motive to testify 
against the appellants.<span>&nbsp; </span>We cannot doubt the sincerity of the 
complainant, for it is unthinkable that a young woman and a third year high 
school student like her, would go to court and air a dishonorable act performed 
upon her by someone if the same is not true, knowing fully well that she would 
be exposing herself to public shame, embarrassment and humiliation.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(<em>People vs. Reyes</em>, 137 SCRA 99).</p>
<p class="BODY">The main thrust of appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelanoâ€™s</span> 
testimony is focused on the testimony of the complainant that after she regained 
consciousness, she noticed the former having sexual intercourse with her, and 
that her panty was below her knees (p. 75, TSN).<span>&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> claims that it was physically impossible for him 
to have had sexual <span>intercourse with the complainant, who was then fifteen 
years old and presumed to be a virgin, because her panty was never removed (p. 
7, Appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano's</span> Brief).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>There is obviously an absence of sincerity and consistency 
in appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano's</span> testimony.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>During the trial, he testified that the complainant </span><span>was 
</span><span>his sweetheart and that he had had sexual intercourse with her many 
times.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 198, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Moreover, the circumstances obtaining in the case at bar 
negate appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano's</span> proposition that it was 
impossible for him to have raped the complainant.<span>&nbsp; </span>It must be 
recalled that when the complainant resisted the appellants' attempts to molest 
her and went inside the jeep, appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> 
followed her and boxed her on the stomach, </span><span>rendering 
</span><span>her unconscious.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was while complainant was lying 
prostrate and defenseless when appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> 
sexually attacked her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Considering the physical state of the 
complainant, she was an easy prey to his bestial instincts although her panty 
was only below her knees.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the complainant explained 
that the garter of her panty was loose.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, on cross 
examination, she testified:<o:p></o:p></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> tried to extricate 
himself by alleging â€œ. . . if what the offended party said was true to the 
effect that she struggled with appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span>, 
the latter must have been able to insert his fingers inside her vagina several 
times, thereby causing the laceration of the hymen, the lacerated wound of the 
vaginal orifice and the swelling and marked reddening with <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> of the vaginal orifice".<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 10, Appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano's</span> 
Brief).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The vacillating nature of this defense is apparent.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>At one instance, appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> would say 
that "nothing unusual happened during the trip" (p. <span>6, 
</span><em>Ibid.</em>) and then he would say that "he must have inserted his 
fingers inside her vagina several times", thus causing the injuries (p. 10, 
<em>ibid.</em>).<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this story is not only far-fetched but 
quite ridiculous.</p>
<p class="BODY">The incredibility of appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano's</span> version is further aggravated by his failure to 
present his niece, Sylvia <span class="SpellE">Bongawen</span>, whom he alleged to 
be with them on their trip to <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span> (pp. 70, 181, 
<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span>&nbsp; </span>Considering the gravity of the 
offense charged against him, he should have presented Sylvia <span class="SpellE">Bongawen</span> to corroborate his testimony that indeed, nothing 
happened between him and the complainant.<span>&nbsp; </span>The suppression of this 
piece of <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence only leads us to inescapable 
conclusion that the testimony of said witness, if produced, would tend to 
sustain the charge.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> 
interposed<em> alibi</em> as his defense, and assails the trial court's 
<span>finding that he conspire with appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> in the commission of the 
crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It cannot be gainsaid that alibi is a weak defense.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In the face of the clear and positive testimony of the prosecution 
witnesses, regarding his participation in the crime, his alibi dwindles into 
nothingness.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>People vs. Tuscano</em>, 137 SCRA 203).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>While it may be true that appellant <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> never had coitus with the complainant, the <span class="SpellE">latters's</span> testimony established that he was responsible in 
inducing her to go with the group on the pretext that her mother was sick; that 
at barrio <span class="SpellE">Camcamalog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pinukpuk</span>, appellant <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> told 
her to alight from the jeep and then he dragged her away and started kissing 
her, mashed her breasts and held her nipples; that somewhere below the ranch of 
Engineer Marana, appellant <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> repeated his 
dastardly acts; that when complainant reminded him that they were relatives, he 
ominously answered, "whatever you do you are mine tonight"; and that while 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> was having sexual intercourse with 
her, appellant <span class="SpellE">Pagano</span> was somewhere on the road, at 
the back of the jeep, keeping watch.<span>&nbsp; </span>His anterior, <span class="SpellE">concommitant</span> and posterior acts indicate that he 
participated and confederated with appellant <span class="SpellE">Hortelano</span> 
in bringing to fruition their criminal design.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Paganao</span> argues that if 
complainant's version is true that both appellants were determined to molest 
her, her natural reaction should have been to run away from her 
aggressors.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, she went to sit at <span>the back of the 
jeep, thus manifesting such conduct which is a little short of 
seduction.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
