<p class="BODY">Before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is a Petition for 
<i>Certiorari</i> assailing the order of the respondent Court dismissing the 
complaint of the petitioners for "Recovery of Possession" on the ground that 
this is an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case within the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the City Court of Manila.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="BODY">In their complaint, plaintiffs (petitioners herein) allege that 
they are the owners of a parcel of land with an area of 199.4 square meters more 
or less, located in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila; that defendant 
(private respondent herein) constructed a house on said lot without plaintiffs' 
permission; that on November 14, 1980, plaintiffs thru counsel made a written 
demand for the removal of said house as well as for the recovery of damages for 
the reasonable use and occupation thereof; and that defendant refused and failed 
to comply despite repeated demands.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="BODY">Upon defendant's motion for dismissal, respondent court issued the 
following ruling:<o:p></o:p></p>
<blockquote>"It is clear on the face of the complaint that at the time of the 
filing of this case on <st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1981">February 19, 
1981</st1:date>, the defendant was in possession, as tenant, of the 
premises.<span>&nbsp; </span>When plaintiffs' counsel, therefore, sent a written 
notice on <st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1980">November 4, 1980</st1:date> 
requiring defendant to vacate the premises when this action was brought, the one 
(1) year period after the unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession has 
not yet set in.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is clear that this is an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case within the exclusive jurisdiction of the City 
Court of Manila.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, the complaint is hereby dismissed.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Plaintiffs moved for a reconsideration contending that there 
has never been any <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-lessee relationship between 
plaintiffs and defendant, that while defendant "has been a lessee of the 
premises of the owner, <span class="SpellE">Fejosera</span> Investment, Inc. but 
when the subject lot was sold to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> on December 7, 1973, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-lessee relationship between them has automatically 
been extinguished; and therefore from December 7, 1973, the occupancy of the 
defendant of the lot by his house standing thereon had become illegal, and that 
plaintiffs' present action is for </span><span class="SpellE"><em>accion</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 
publiciana</span><span>, because the withholding of the lot in question by the 
defendant had been without their permission and consent."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent court denied said motion for reconsideration, hence the 
present petition on the following grounds:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -18.9pt; margin-left: 40.5pt;" class="NUM">I.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span>The respondent court has decided a question of substance, not theretofore 
determined by the Supreme Court, with respect to the issue of <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-lessee relationship.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -18.9pt; margin-left: 40.5pt;" class="NUM">II.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span>The respondent court has decided this case in a way probably not in 
accord with law.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners raise the issue of <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-lessee relationship to determine whether the Court of 
First Instance (now known as the Regional Trial Court) or the City Court of 
Manila (now known as the Metropolitan Trial Court) has exclusive jurisdiction 
over this case.<span>&nbsp; </span>If there had been such a relationship, still the 
issue boils down as to how long the private respondent had been unlawfully 
withholding from petitioners the possession of the lot in question.</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent Court ruled that the unlawful withholding should 
commence from the time the demand letter of November 14, 1980 was received by 
private respondent and not from the time the petitioners bought the lot on 
December <span>7, 1973, and that when the action was brought on February 19, 
1981, the one-year period had not yet lapsed, therefore the City Court of Manila 
had exclusive jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that the unlawful withholding was for seven 
years or for more than one year because when the property was sold the lease 
contract between the former owners, <span class="SpellE">Fejosera</span> 
Investment Incorporated and defendant was automatically extinguished, as the 
right of the seller to lease the property has ceased to exist.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioners maintain that it is their prerogative as the new owners 
whether or not to lease the property to the private respondent.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Their inaction cannot be considered as their tacit approval or consent 
for the private respondent to prolong his stay in the premises and even if it 
can be so considered the non-payment of rentals has been for <span>more 
</span>than a year.</p>
<p class="BODY">We have noted that while petitioners allege in their complaint 
that they are the owners of the lot on which the house of the private respondent 
is constructed, their attached TCT shows that the lot is still in the name of 
<span class="SpellE">Fejosera</span> Investment Incorporated.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Private respondent and said company entered into a contract of lease in 
1950 for the use and occupation of said lot.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners allegedly 
bought the lot in question in 1973, and they must have been fully aware of the 
occupancy of the private respondent of the premises in question.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Yet, they did not take any action to remove the house of the private 
respondent or to inform the respondent that they had become the new owners of 
the lot in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is clear therefore that the lease was 
allowed to continue.</p>
<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, petitioners are in error when they say that 
because they are the buyers of the lot involved herein, they <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto </span>have the right to terminate an 
existing lease.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can do so but only if the lease itself is not 
recorded, and they, as buyers, are not aware of the lease's existence and 
duration, thus Art. 1676 of the Civil Code says:</p>
<blockquote>"The purchaser of a piece of land which is under a lease that is not 
recorded in the Registry of Property may terminate the lease, save<sub> 
</sub>when there is a stipulation to the contrary in the contract of sale, or 
when the purchaser knows of the existence of the lease.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"If the buyer makes use of this right, the lessee may demand that he 
be allowed to gather the fruits of the harvest which corresponds to the current 
agricultural year and that the <span class="GramE">vendor indemnify</span> him for 
damages suffered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"If the sale is fictitious, for the purpose of extinguishing the 
lease, the supposed vendee cannot make use of the right granted in the first 
paragraph of this article.<span>&nbsp; </span>The sale is presumed to be fictitious 
if at the time the supposed vendee demands the termination of the lease, the 
sale is not recorded in the Registry of Property.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(1571a)"</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the present case, the lease is not recorded, and although 
petitioner knew of its existence, there was no fixed period for its duration â€” 
hence the lease was </span><em>generally</em> <span>terminable at the will of 
the buyers - petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>But of course they had to make a demand 
for its termination.<span>&nbsp; </span>This demand, they actually made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>C</span>onsequently, the possession of private respondent 
over the lot in question became illegal only on <st1:date month="11" day="14" year="1980">November 14, 1980</st1:date>, when the formal demand to pay and 
vacate the premises was sent to him.<span>&nbsp; </span>The case is clearly one of 
illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> which must be filed within one year 
from the date of the last demand.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the complaint against 
private respondent was filed on <st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1981">February 19, 1981</st1:date>, the one year period had not yet 
lapsed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such being the case the court <em>a quo</em> did not 
acquire jurisdiction over the case and the proper action should have been one of 
Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span> which necessarily falls within the 
original and exclusive jurisdiction of the City Court.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span>,</span> the instant petition is hereby 
DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>
