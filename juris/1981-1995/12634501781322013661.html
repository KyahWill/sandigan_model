</span>The trial court based its judgment of conviction principally on his tes­timony.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the prosecution, on August 11, 1968 Gonzalo Perez,

a jobless neighbor and friend of De la Cruz, residing at 7374 San <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, offered to them the mission of killing <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span> Tan in consideration of a reward of twenty thousand

<p class="BODY">Gonzalo said that the persons interested in the liquidation of
Tan were Captain Jesus Buenaventura and Detective Corporal <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
San Miguel, 31, of the Manila Police Department.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few days later, Gonzalo brought De la Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Dacer</span> to the house of his brother <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>

Chinese businessmen and that the assassination could be consummated with

the attempt of De la Cruz to extort P15<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied having taken part in the four
surveillance operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he was
not on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Escolta</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
when Tan was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in the <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place> doing his job as manager of
the family trucking business.</p>

<p class="BODY">Raul Mendoza, the driver of the family of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
Perez, did not present any evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court characterized the alibi of Gonzalo Perez as a
fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gonzalo mentioned the
birthday of his son as a reason for his alleged presence in <st1:city><st1:place>Santa
  Maria</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> on the day
when Tan was killed but because he could not tell the dates of birth of his
wife and other children, the trial court did not believe his alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court also disbelieved the alibi of Ricardo Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reasoned out that from the South Harbor
Ricardo could have gone to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> in a short time.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the defense of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Perez, the
trial court observed that his denials cannot prevail over the positive
testimony of De la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It noted that
there was no showing that <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> desisted from having
any further participation in the implementation of the conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also noted that the plan was for the conspirators
to meet in <span class="SpellE">Alipio's</span> house after the
assassination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fertile imagination is
not required to surmise that the purpose of that last rendezvous would be the
payment of the reward and its apportionment among the conspirators.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> and Mendoza assail
the trustworthiness of the testimony of De la Cruz because it came from a
"polluted source" and was not entirely corroborated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of De la Cruz is a confirmation of his 24-page
extrajudicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. U and U-1) made to
Congressman <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> and Fiscal Francisco C. Burgos
on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1968</st1:date> (24
days after the killing) and before he was discharged as defendant in the trial
court's order of <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">His confession and testimony contain details that would be
difficult to fabricate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was utilized
as a State witness because the prosecution had no evidence on the conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of a co-conspirator should be received with caution
because, as is usual with human nature, a culprit, confessing a crime, is
likely to put the blame as far as possible on others and thus minimize his
culpability.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator may be
sufficient for conviction when it is shown to be sincere in itself, because
given unhesitatingly and in a straight-forward manner, and in replete with
details which, by their nature, could not have been the result of a deliberate
afterthought or concoction (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, 69
Phil. 740, 742).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the testimony of De la Cruz to be
satisfactory and convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had not
been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified at eight hearings between
October 21 and <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He withstood the rigorous cross-examination
of able defense lawyers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two bellboys of the Morocco Hotel, Tan's driver and an
eyewitness, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Pallan</span>, corroborated portions of
the testimony and confession of De la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No error was committed by the trial court in giving credence to his
testimony and written ad­missions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants argue that there was no motive for them to conspire to
kill Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That contention cannot be
taken seriously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was the reward to
be paid for the killing of Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If those
interested in the liquidation of Tan were willing to pay P20,000 to the
triggerman, it stands to reason that they would pay another amount to the <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> and their driver, Mendoza, who cooperated in
looking for the triggerman and who took part in the surveillance operations in
order to enable the triggerman to consummate the assassination.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no doubt that <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>
and San Miguel were the two persons contacted by the enemy or enemies of Tan to
encompass his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two strove hard
to fulfill their commitment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They sought
the assistance of the Perez family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Perez appellants cooperated with them because <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
was a <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span> of <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>
while Ricardo was a <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span> of San Miguel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span> relationship is a
strong bond of loyalty and friendship which binds a person to his <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That circumstance plus the opportunity to make money on the side is the
motive which impelled the <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> and Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Alipio's</span> driver, to take part in the liquidation of Tan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not disclose who instigated <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>
and San Miguel to stultify <span class="GramE">themselves</span> and engineer the
killing of Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De la Cruz in his
confession said that he was not aware of any person surnamed <span class="SpellE">Tankeh</span> nor any employee of the Ace Line (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. U) <span class="GramE">who</span>, as intimated in the
questions of Fiscal Burgos, might be involved in Tan's killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court took an unfavorable view of <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>'s
failure to take the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rule is that a defendant's "neglect or refusal to be a witness shall not
in any manner prejudice or be used against him" (Sec, 1[d], Rule 115,
Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">What the trial court meant was that <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
did not present any evidence at all to controvert De la Cruz's testimony that
he was a co-conspirator who took part in the surveillance missions and was
present at the scene of the crime and, therefore, had community of design with <span class="SpellE">Dacer</span> and De la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>'s failure to present
evidence means that the testimony of De la Cruz against him remains <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> or <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the complicity of the Perez brothers and of Ricardo
Perez and Mendoza in the killing of Tan was proven beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See Resolution
of January 29, 1969 in Perez vs. Robles, L-30089-90, sustaining the trial
court's order denying bail to the herein four appellants).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly characterized the killing of Tan as
murder qualified by evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The aggravating circumstance of treachery is offset by the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the trial court imposed <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> on Mendoza, Gonzalo Perez, <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Perez and Ricardo Perez.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to Gonzalo Perez, there is ample justification for convicting
him as a co-principal of San Miguel and <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>
and for sentencing him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gonzalo was very active in planning the killing
and implementing the conspiracy to liquidate Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contacted the triggerman and his
collaborator, De la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took part
in the surveillance missions, using his jeep for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was present at the scene of the crime,
having brought thereto <span class="SpellE">Dacer</span>, De la Cruz, Ricardo
Perez and Mendoza.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the other three appellants, it is true that they were
co-conspirators and had community of design with <span class="SpellE">Dacer</span>,
San Miguel and <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first blush, they should be re­garded as
co-principals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once conspiracy is
established, the act of a co-conspirator is the act of all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three appellants must have been induced to take part in the
conspiracy because of the promised reward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is reasonable to assume that they must have received already some advance
payment, like <span class="SpellE">Dacer</span> and De la Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the stubborn fact remains that their participation
in carrying out the conspiracy was not very indispensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Perez was
not present at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His house was used as a meeting place of the co-conspirators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took part only in the first surveillance
operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is testimony that he
suggested surveillance in the morning at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Cuneta</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> because Tan
would bring his children to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> allegedly gave money to <span class="SpellE">Dacer</span>
and De la Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ricardo Perez, the son of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>, was
drawn into the conspiracy because he was San Miguel's <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
was the family driver of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance explains why he was
embroiled in the conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is doubtful whether the roles of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
Perez, Ricardo Perez and Mendoza in the assassination of Tan are sufficient to
justify their conviction as co-principals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold that the rule in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, 44
Phil. 38, that in case of doubt the courts lean to the miner form of criminal
responsibility, applies to this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those three appellants should be regarded as accomplices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Nierra</span>, L-32624, February 12, 1980, 96 SCRA 1).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment as to Gonzalo Perez is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court's judgment as
to Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Perez and his son Ricardo Perez is
