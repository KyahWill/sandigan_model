<p class="BODY"><span style="">The victim Epitacio
Aganan was a fish vendor.  On October
26, 1989, he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">to go to Navotas Fishport to buy fish.  At around 10:35 P.M., that </span><span style="">same day, </span><span style="">Epitacio, his daughter Rhodora Aganan, and two (2) other companions,
namely, Flora Fuentes and Sancho Ignacio, headed for the fishport on board a
Tamaraw pick-up vehicle.  Epitacio was
the driver.  Seated beside him was
Rhodora.  Sancho and Flora, on the other
hand, sat at the back portion of the Tamaraw.  While they were passing along Janet Street, more or less one (1)
kilometer from the Aganan residence,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> three </span>(3) men flagged down their

<span style="">Rhodora thus asked her father who those

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching Ledesma Court, along Visayas Avenue, the three men
requested Epitacio to stop the Tamaraw as they were going to alight.  As soon as they alighted, accused Perciano,
walked towards the right side of the vehicle, announced a “hold-up” and poked <span style="">a </span>gun on Epitacio.  Nervous, Rhodora looked out of the window
and saw Restituto from half a meter distance holding a gun with his left
hand.  The gun <span style="">was </span>fired and Epitacio was hit on the right armpit.  Epitacio stepped on the accelerator, leaving
behind the hold-uppers who immediately fled.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a short distance, the wounded Epitacio lost control of the
vehicle which crashed against <span style="">a </span>Meralco
lamp post.  He collapsed on Rhodora’s
lap.  Rhodora shouted for help.  People came and rushed Epitacio to the East
Avenue Medical Center.  He was dead on
arrival.</p>

the victim revealed the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the accused and two (2) other men within the vicinity.  They were walking back and forth across the

(3) years, passed by.  She saw Rhodora
and two other companions on board the Tamaraw.  Accused and his companions then left without paying for the

Restituto.  Rufo then checked on
Restituto and found the latter sleeping at his post.  He woke him up.  Restituto
stood up and blew his whistle as Rufo returned to his post.  The next day, October 27, 1989, at 6:00
A.M., Rufo and Restituto went home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At 8:00 <span style="">P.M. </span>of

<p class="BODY">Her credibility is enhanced by the fact that she had <span style="">no ill-motive to testify falsely against the
accused?appellant.  She did not
know accused-appellant before the incident.  It is a rule that “when there </span>is <span style="">no evidence indicating that the principal witness for the prosecution </span>was
<span style="">moved by improper motive, the
presumption is that he was not so moved and his testimony is entitled to full
faith and credit.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, </span>as <span style="">between the alibi of accused-appellant and the positive declaration of
Rhodora identifying the accused-appellant </span>as <span style="">the gunman, the latter deserves greater credence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are not convinced of
accused-appellant’s claim of innocence.  His left hand was positive for gunpowder nitrates.  He did not explain the presence of these
nitrates.  Instead, he tried to prove
that he is right handed.  But the fact
that he is right handed does not negate the possibility that he fired at the
victim using his left hand.  The gun in
question is a .38 caliber pistol which could easily be fired.  More importantly, the prosecution had proved
that the fatal bullet came from the service gun of accused-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evidence that
accused-appellant reported for work, on October 26, 1989, at around 8:00 P.M.,
is not indubitable.  Buen Nicol, the custodian
of the attendance logbook of the San Pedro IV Subdivision, testified as

that time.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q:  And you could not also remember Mr. Nicol
if the security guards assigned to the subdivision where you are the board
member reported for work on October 26, 1989?</blockquote>

because you were not present at that time although you are the custodian of
this logbook?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
signed,<span style=""> </span>sir, in the morning of October 27.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q:  So, the procedure of these security guards in signing their names in
this logbook is that when they reported for example on October 26, 1989, they
did not immediately sign their names?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
they only signed their names the following day, October 27, 1989 in the
morning?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>IN

<blockquote>“Q:  So that you are not in a position to tell us whether or not these guards

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The unexplained presence
of gunpowder nitrates on the left hand of accused-appellant, the slug recovered
from the body of the victim which matched the test bullets from
accused-appellant’s service gun, the nature of the wound sustained by the victim
and the positive identification of accused-appellant as the gunman cannot be
overcome by the alibi of accused-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court did not
err in finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Attempted
Robbery with Homicide.  Craft was
employed in the commission of the offense since accused-appellant and his
