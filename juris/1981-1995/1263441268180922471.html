				<H3>FLAVIANO S. GASPAY, JR., AND ERIBERTA S. GASPAY, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND GUADALUPE GASPAY ALFARO, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PUNO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeking to reverse the
Decision of the respondent Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 25872.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts reveal that Flaviano Gaspay died without a last will
and testament on October 14, 1983 in Tacloban City.  He was then married to Agueda Denoso.  They were childless.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 6, 1988, private respondent Guadalupe Gaspay Alfaro filed
a petition in the trial court<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
alleging, among others, that she is the acknowledged illegitimate daughter of
the deceased Flaviano Gaspay, who died without a will and left certain real and
personal properties.  She identified her
mother as Claudia Pason with whom decedent allegedly had an illicit
relationship.  She prayed for issuance
of letters of administration of the decedent's estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners Flaviano S. Gaspay, Jr., and Eriberta Salvatieva
Gaspay opposed the petition with motion to dismiss.  Flaviano, Jr., is an adopted son of the decedent while Eriberta
is also not a next of kin.  They alleged
that private respondent is a stranger and even assuming her illegitimate status,
there is no proof of her recognition or acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss was denied.  The trial court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
ruled it was not based on indubitable grounds.  Evidence was then adduced by private respondent.  In an Order dated December 6, 1989, the
trial court dismissed the petition.  It
held:  (1) the testimonial and
documentary evidence<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
failed to prove the purported status of private respondent; (2) they also
failed to show that private respondent, then already of age consented to her
recognition as an illegitimate child;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and (3) even if the petition were to be treated as an action to compel
recognition, it would not prosper because it should have been filed during the
lifetime of Flaviano Gaspay.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent appealed to the respondent Court of Appeals.  In a Decision promulgated September 30,
1991, the Special Third Division<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
of the respondent court reversed the trial court.  It held:  (1) the evidence
is ample to prove the filiation and recognition of private respondent as an
illegitimate child of the decedent; (2) the evidence is also sufficient to show
that private respondent consented to her recognition by the decedent; and (3)
actions based on voluntary recognition can be instituted after the death of the
putative father.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, private respondent filed the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
contending:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THE APPELLATE COURT ERRED IN DISTURBING THE
FINDINGS OF FACT OF THE TRIAL COURT WITH REGARDS TO THE CREDIBILITY OF WITNESS
MARTIN GARIN WHICH WAS NOT EVEN MADE AN ASSIGNED ERROR IN APPELLANT'S BRIEF (IN
VIOLATION OF SECTION 7, RULE 51 OF THE RULES OF COURT)</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>THE APPELLATE COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT
THE ALLEGED OPEN AND CONTINUOUS POSSESSION OF GUADALUPE OF THE STATUS OF AN
ILLEGITIMATE CHILD CAN STILL BE BROUGHT AFTER THE DEATH OF THE ALLEGED PARENT
(WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE <span style="">PROVISIONS OF
ARTICLE 175 IN RELATION TO SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE 172 OF THE FAMILY CODE).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>THE APPELLATE COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT
GUADALUPE IS ENTITLED TO LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first error, it cannot be gainsaid that private
respondent assailed on appeal the correctness of the trial court’s conclusion
of fact that the evidence failed to prove her allegation that she was
recognized as an illegitimate daughter by the decedent.  In resolving this factual issue, the
respondent court did not err in exhaustively examining each and every specie of
evidence relevant thereto and one of them involves the truth of the testimony
of witness Martin Garin.  Indeed, this
key issue cannot be resolved authoritatively without considering the testimony
of Garin, the principal witness of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the competence and credibility of witness
Garin.  The trial court did not give any
value to his testimony.  The respondent
court did.  We sustain the respondent
court.  Garin testified that the two (2)
letters marked as Exhibits "K" and "L" were written by the
decedent.  These letters are vital
evidence for the private respondent for they show that the decedent acknowledged
her as his daughter.  Exhibit
"K" written in "waray" dialect was translated in the trial
court as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Tomalisties
Caibiran Leyte</p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">  March 10, 1980</p>

<blockquote>My dear Child,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lupe, I received your letter and I understood your purpose that you
are asking for money in the sum of P500.00 pesos because you are going to use
it for the operation of the feet of your child Marilyn.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But Lupe, because I am short of money, accept in the meantime this
P200.00 pesos because this is the only amount I can raise to send you here at
Southern Island Hospital Cebu City, for I pity you because you are my child and
Marilyn my grandchild.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Your father,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Sgd.) Flaviano Gaspay"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On the other hand, Exhibit "L"
also written in "waray" was translated as follows</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 5in; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"Tomalities, Caibiran,
Leyte<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>My children Toming and Lupe,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Because I feel my body is about to weaken already.  I urge you to verify my lands located in
Culaba and in Caibiran so that the share of Lupe will be assured.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Toming, this letter to you is my gift on your birthday today.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Your father,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Sgd.) Flaviano Gaspay”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court dismissed the testimony of Garin on two (2)
grounds.  First, it held that Garin did
not even bother to examine the letters, Exhibits "K" and
"L".  The records do not
sustain this ruling.  We quote the
relevant testimony of Garin, <u>viz</u>:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Secondly, the trial court noted that the
last time Garin received a letter from the decedent was in 1961 and the last
time he saw him write was in 1959.  It
held that Garin had no competence to testify about the authenticity of Exhibit
"L" written in 1980 and Exhibit "M" written in 1983.  In reversing this ruling, the respondent
court held and we agree that the trial court “unfairly assumes that Flaviano
Gaspay's penmanship actually metamorphosed into something divergent or
different from what Garin saw him write in 1959 and 1961.  For it is a fact that there are people whose
hand remain steady over the years, and whose eyes even acquire better vision in
their twilight years.” We hasten to add that petitioners did not present any
evidence to prove any change in the penmanship of Gaspay, Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are also satisfied that the evidence profusely proved that
private respondent consented to her voluntary recognition as an illegitimate
child by the decedent.  As well analyzed
by the respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>"To begin with, petitioner has been sporting the name
Guadalupe Gaspay since childhood up to the time she got married to Bartolome
Alfaro on May 22, 1953 and even up to the present her acknowledged name is
Guadalupe Gaspay Alfaro (Exhibits J, J-1 and J-2).  And then when she filed the subject petition in this case she used
the same surname <u>Gaspay</u> after her father and Alfaro after her lawful
spouse since her marriage, thereby accepting the fact and telling the world
that she is the recognized daughter of the deceased Flaviano Gaspay.  At the time the present petition was filed
on July 26, 1988 petitioner was already over 51 years old, having been born on
December 12, 1936.  All these undisputed
facts are sufficient evidence that she consented to her <span style="">acknowledgment by the decedent.  (<u>Javelona, et al. vs. Monteclaro, 74 Phil. 393</u>).  Whether or not judicial approval of such
acknowledgment is required was answered in the negative in <u>Apacible, et al.
vs. Castillo, 74 Phil. 589</u>, where the Supreme Court held that such approval
may be supplied by the child's consent given after reaching majority, which
obtained in the case at bar.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In light of the above, the death of
Flaviano Gaspay, Sr., does not constitute a time bar to private respondent's
claim as his acknowledged illegitimate daughter.  Settled is the rule that "actions based on voluntary
acknowledgment may be brought even after the father's death."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, private respondent has proved her entitlement to be
administrator of the estate of Flaviano Gaspay, Sr., her father.  Section 6 of Rule 78 is in her favor, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 6.  When and to
whom letters of administration granted.  - If no executor is named in the will, or the executor or executors are
incompetent, refused the trust, or fail to give bond, or a person dies
intestate, administration shall be granted:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  If such surviving husband or wife, as the
case may be, or next of kin, or the person selected by them, be incompetent or
unwilling, or if the <u>husband or widow, or next kin, neglects for thirty (30)
days after time death of the person to apply for administration or to request
that administration be granted to some other person</u>, it may be granted to
one or more of the principal creditors, if competent and willing to serve;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)  If there is no such creditor competent and
willing to serve, <u>it may be granted to such other person as the court may
select</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">For a fact, petitioners neglected to
apply for letters of administration thirty (30) days after the death of Gaspay,
Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
dismissed there being no reversible error in the Decision of the respondent
