resolution dated <st1:date year="1991" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1991</st1:date>
dismissing the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The setting aside of the trial court's
decision was based on the sole ground that the petitioner's action for
reconveyance is barred by prescription as the period of four (4) years had
already expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition originated from a complaint for reconveyance and
damages filed by the petitioner against the private respondent on <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1977</st1:date> with the Court of
First Instance of Bukidnon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are found in the decision of the trial
court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As revealed by the Records, it appears that plaintiff
Feliciana Licayan Tale, now 82 years of age, daughter of the deceased Agustin
Licayan or Manlicayan, inherited an agricultural land covered by OCT No. 125,
Exhibit "K", located at Casisang, Malaybalay, Bukidnon with an area
of 15.5947 hectares, but which only around 8.5 hectares or 1/2 of it was
inherited by her from her deceased mother, Antonia Jose, declared in her name
as owner under Tax Declaration No. 10301, Exhibit "C", for the year
1950, and Tax Declaration No. 03895, Exhibit "B", for the year
1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Land taxes were paid by the
plaintiff as shown by a series of tax receipts which dated as far back in 1950,
Exhibits "F" to "F-18" inclusive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During World War II, defendant Paterno Talisik, a veteran of World
War II lived with Igmedio Tale, son of the plaintiff who later on married the
daughter of Damiano Licayen Tale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter gave his son-in-law, Paterno Talisik a piece of agricultural land with
an area of around 2.5 hectares which Damiano Tale bought from Dolores Dinulan
who in turn acquired it from Benigno Sumalta.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime in 1971, defendant Paterno Talisik caused the inclusion in
his Free Patent No. 50711, covered by OCT No. P-5827, Exhibit "A",
page 23, Records of Exhibits, a portion of plaintiff's land with an area of
2.2500 hectares as shown in the sketch plan prepared by Geodetic Engineer
Rafael Tilanduca, Exhibit “D”, page 26, Records of Exhibits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The land now covered by OCT No. 5827 in the name of Paterno Talisik
covers an aggregate area of 5 hectares instead of only 2.5 hectares, the size
of the land which his father-in-law, Damiano Tale, gave during the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because the defendant had caused
around 2.5 hectares of plaintiff's land included in his title.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The 2.5 hectares which defendant added to the 2.5 hectares given to
him by his father?in-law can not be said to have been acquired by him
through prescription because plaintiff's land, of which a portion of 2.5
hectares was included in the title of defendant Talisik was already covered by
a Free Patent in the name of Agustin Licayan or Manlicayan, the father of
plaintiff Feliciana Licayan Tale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The issue involved in the case at bar hinges on the question of
ownership of the 2.5 hectares of land included in defendant's title, Exhibit
"A".</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court opines that notwithstanding the inclusion of the 2.5
hectares of plaintiff's land in defendant's title, the plaintiff still retained
true and absolute ownership of the said portion for reason that the land in
question formerly belongs to plaintiff's father and covered by OCT No. 125 in
the name of Agustin Licayan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prescription can not set in this case, because the portion of land
claimed by the defendant was previously a part covered by the title of
plaintiff's predecessor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendant Talisik in his defense never adduced any evidence to
support his claim of ownership on the questioned land, except the testimony of
Silvano Amolat who testified that he used to buy bamboos from defendant Talisik
presumably growing on the land in question which bamboo groves were claimed by
plaintiff to have been planted by Agustin Licayan, her father." (Original
Record, pp. 87-88)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1989</st1:date>,
the Regional Trial Court of Malaybalay, Bukidnon, <span class="GramE">Branch</span>
9 rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby
rendered declaring plaintiff Feliciana Licayan Tale as owner of the portion
with an area of 2.5 hectares located on the northern side of defendant's land
as shown in the sketch plan of Lot No. 748 Pls 800, Exhibit "D",
being a portion of OCT No. 125, Exhibit "K", in the name of Agustin
Licayan or Manlicayan, plaintiff's father.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ordering the defendant to execute a proper deed of conveyance
on the aforesaid portion in favor of the plaintiff and to cause a survey and
segregation of the aforesaid portion and deliver the same to the
plaintiff." (Records, p. 89)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
the private respondent interposed an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals issued its questioned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subsequent motion for reconsideration of the petitioner was
denied by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, in its questioned decision, held that
prescription bars the institution of the action for reconveyance based on
fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the rule espoused in <u>Esconde</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Barlongay</u>, (152 SCRA 602 [1987]) and <u>Balbin</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Medalla</u>,
(108 SCRA 666 [1981]) that an action for reconveyance based on fraud must be
filed within four years, the Court of Appeals ruled that the four-year period
had already expired counting from January 31, 1972, the time the original
certificate of title was issued to the private respondent, to August 19, 1977,
the time when the complaint was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are constrained to reverse the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is no question as to when the
prescription period commences, the conclusion about the four-year prescriptive
period is erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the prescriptive period for an action for
reconveyance based on fraud is ten (10) years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issue on the prescriptive period for such an action has been
thoroughly discussed in the case of <u>Amerol</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Bagumbaran</u>
(154 SCRA 396, 406-407 [1987]), to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;

the old Civil Code or in the old Code of Civil Procedure, the latter being then
resorted to as legal basis of the four-year prescriptive period for an action

<p class="BODY">The Court in <u>Amerol</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Bagumbaran</u> (<u>supra</u>)
took note of the varying decisions on whether the four-year period or ten-year
period should apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
Justice Paras who penned <u>Esconde</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Barlongay</u> (<u>supra</u>),
which formed a basis for the four-year rule of the questioned decision, and
Justices Yap, Melencio-Herrera, Padilla, and Sarmiento who concurred in the
July 31, 1987 decision constituted the same Second Division which promulgated
the ten-year rule in <u>Amerol</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Bagumbaran</u> (<u>supra</u>)
on September 10, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Padilla in <u>Amerol</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Bagumbaran</u>,
however, made this distinction in a concurring and dissenting opinion:</p>

<blockquote>"I concur in the result. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I do not however agree with the sweeping
proposition that all actions for reconveyance, based upon the ground of fraud,
prescribe in ten (10) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
distinction should be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fraud, or <u>dolo</u>,
it should be recalled, is of two (2) kinds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>dolo</u> <u>causante</u>, or that which determines or is the
essential cause of the consent; and <u>dolo</u> <u>incidente</u>, or that which
does not have such decisive influence and by itself cannot cause the giving of
consent, but refers only to some particular or accident of obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Tolentino, Civil Code of
the Philippines, 1956 ed., Vol IV, p. 463).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>If the fraud committed was but an incident to the registration of
land (<u>dolo</u> <u>incidente</u>), as in the case at bar, then I would agree
that the action for reconveyance prescribes in ten (10) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, where it is necessary to annul a deed or
title before relief could be granted, as when fraud, which vitiates consent (<u>dolo</u>
<u>causante</u>), is alleged to have been committed in the execution of the
deed which became the basis for the registration of a parcel of land, the
action for reconveyance should be filed within four (4) years from the
discovery of the fraud." (<span class="GramE">id</span>. at p. 409)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The ten-year prescriptive period was
reiterated in subsequent cases, among them, <u>Caro</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Appeals</u>, 180 SCRA 401, 405-406 [1989], and <u>Pagkatipunan</u> <u>v.</u>
<u>Intermediate</u> <u>Appellate</u> <u>Court</u>, 198 SCRA 719, 731-732
[1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the period from the date of the issuance of
the certificate of title over the real property which was <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1972</st1:date> to the filing of the action in <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1977</st1:date> is well within the
ten-year period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals did not deem it necessary to rule on the
question of ownership of the contested land since it dismissed the case on the
ground of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this
Court having ruled that the action is not barred by prescription, the question
of ownership of the 2.5 hectares of land included in the private respondent's
title should now be examined.</p>
