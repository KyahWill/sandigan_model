<p class="2Q">“The undersigned State Prosecutor accuses the above-named accused
of the crime of FRUSTRATED HOMICIDE, committed as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">“That on or about the 4th day of February 1971, in the Municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused,
with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlaw­fully and feloniously
attack, assault <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>shoot one
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> y <span class="SpellE">Castrence</span>,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>hitting and inflicting upon the vital
parts of his body gunshot wounds which would produce the crime of homicide as a
consequence but which, nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes
independent of the will of the perpetrator, that is because of the timely and
able medical attendance rendered to the offended party which prevented his
death.” (p. 24, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as culled from the record are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1971</st1:date>,
Francisco de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> (the offended party), along with others had a
drinking session which started <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">at </span>about
<st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the morning and
ended at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o’clock</st1:time> that same
afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> slept at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the evening of
the same day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, Angel A. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> and <span class="SpellE">lrineo</span> Vera alias ‘<span class="SpellE">B<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a</span>lat</span>’
arrived looking for <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> who was still then
sleeping and thereafter the accused boxed <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Vera pacified the accused and told him that
that was enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused asked for
the P800.00 which he had requested <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> to keep
to which the latter replied that he has spent P290.00 of said money in gambling
and for women.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span>
returned the rest of the money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not contended,
accused verified from the owner of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>gambling
place as to the veracity of <span class="SpellE">Villaranda’s</span> reply which
was attested to be true by the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused, with a certain <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, invited <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> to his house for another drinking spree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival, accused and <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
engaged in their drinking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About fifteen
minutes later, the accused boxed <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span>, fired a
shot into the air and then aimed two shots at him but only the third shot hit <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> in the head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> fell on the sofa where he had been
sitting, and was eventually brought to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> by a certain Jamie <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and the accused for treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Florante</span> Jimenez conducted an
investigation regarding the incident upon the information of one Miss <span class="SpellE">Gulmatico</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">The trial Court found the accused guilty of the crime charged in
a decision dated <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1974</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Court
finds the accused Angel <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> alias Bobby <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
‘Frustrated Homicide’ defined and penalized under Article 249 in relation to
Article 6 and Article 250 of the Revised Penal Code, without any mitigating or
aggravating circumstances, and pursuant to the Indeterminate Sentence Law
hereby sentences him to suffer an imprisonment of TWO (2) MONTHS and ONE (1)
DAY TO TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY, to indemnify Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> in the sum of P15,000.00, and to pay the costs.”

respondent Court, on <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1976</st1:date>,
affirmed the trial court’s decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
motion for reconsideration of said decision was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition to review the respondent
court’s decision. </p>

Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<p class="2Q">“THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN SIMPLY ADOPTING THE FINDINGS AND
CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL COURT THAT WERE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS, SURMISES,
CONJECTURES AND MISTAKEN INFERENCES.”</p>

<p class="2Q">“THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT, IN

<p class="2Q">“THE COURT OF APPEALS, IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL
COURT, ERRED IN DISREGARDING, OR IN NOT APPLYING DOCTRINAL JURISPRUDENCE

<p class="2Q">“THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THE APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE
CRIME OF FRUSTRATED HOMICIDE.”</p>

<p class="2Q">(pp. 6 and 12, Brief for the Respondents-<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner however
presents his version of what he thought to have transpired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That while he and <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
were drinking and conversing at the terrace outside the living room of his
house, <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> got appellant’s automatic pistol
from the drawer of the cabinet where it was usually kept - because <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> knew where the pistol was kept - and then fired
the pistol into the air, and when asked by the appellant why he fired the gun
he said that he fired the gun because he was happy that the appellant had
forgiven him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant wrested the
gun from <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> and after holding it for some
moments, he instructed <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> to return the gun
to the drawer where it was usually kept.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span>, instead of returning the gun
to where it was kept, placed the gun on the narrow table at the landing place </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a stairway in the living room <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span>the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pack </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">cigarettes that <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> bought was placed
on that table too.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
and </span>the appellant at the time were at the terrace outside the living
room of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A little later <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> asked the appellant for some cigarettes, and the
appellant went to the table where the pack of cigarettes was placed - the very
table where <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> placed the gun, but the
appellant did not know that the gun was there and he did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">see </span>it because the living room was a
little dark - and when the appellant got the pack of cigarettes he unknowingly
grazed or brushed down from the table the gun that had been placed there and
the automatic pistol fell to the floor and exploded, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">or </span>automatically fired, and the bullet hit the left <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">portion </span>of the head of <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span>, who was at the time sitting on the sofa.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon noticing that <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> was hit
by a bullet in the head, the appellant immediately went out of his house to
look for a vehicle to carry <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> to the
hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant found a jeep and
he, with the help of <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, forthwith brought <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> which was the nearest
hospital from his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> was immediately given medical attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was operated on by Dr. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>, a <span class="SpellE">neuro</span> surgeon, and his
life was saved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span>
was in the hospital for about twenty days, and the appellant was able to pay
for all the hospital bills, except the professional fees of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the finding of the trial court, which
was adopted by the Court of Appeals, that the appellant fired the shot that hit
the head of the offended party was based solely on the uncorroborated testimony
of said offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">We adopt the finding of the trial court when it rejected the
defense version because of its inherent incredibility as borne out by the
evidence on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on
overwhelming prosecution evidence, it ruled as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“The Court is convinced that the accused fired the shot which hit
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span> as a result of which he sustained
gunshot wound for which reason he was operated on at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>.” (CFI, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Decision, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">p. 54 </span>Brief for the Accused-Appellant; Annex E, p. 36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court sustained the stand taken by the trial court
when it stated thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">“The resolution of the factual issue on who fired the shot which
caused a gunshot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">wound </span>in the
head of the complainant hinges on the credibility of witnesses and the settled,
long standing rule on the matter is for the appellate tribunal to give due
respect to the assessment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the
facts made by the lower court, said court having had the opportunity, not only
of receiving the evidence, but also of observing the conduct and demeanor of
the witnesses while testifying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And,
this rule is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>to be
overturned unless there is a showing that in making the disputed factual
findings, the trial court had overlooked or failed to consider certain facts of
weight and importance that could have materially affected the conclusion
reached in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. Dorado,
30 SCRA 53; People vs. Sales, 44 SCRA 489, 496)</p>

<p class="2Q">“The trial court has not overlooked any fact of weight and
importance that could have materially affected the conclusion reached in the
case.” (Court of Appeals decision, p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of People vs. Canada, 12 SCRA 9, We ruled that
although there is no direct evidence pointing to the accused as the person who
inflicted the wounds that caused the death of the accused, where the
circumstances point out by the lower court constitute more than sufficient
evidence to convince the appellate court that he is the only one with
sufficient motive to wish the death of the deceased, it is held that the
appellant was properly convicted of homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner maintains that no evidence was presented to
support the trial court’s decision ordering him to indemnify the offended party
in the sum of P15,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
court therefore committed an error in sustaining the trial court’s ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner’s contention has no merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record discloses that the very testimony
of Dr. Romeo H. <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>, who operated on the victim
justifies such indemnification, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Now,
doctor, because of that injury did you perform an operation in that body of Mr.
<span class="SpellE">Villaranda</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
we had an operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We admitted the

you performed the operation, did you recover any slugs or bullets?</blockquote>

was no slug but there was metallic foreign body and blood clotting.</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">tempora</span>-parietal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Witness pointing to his left forehead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Before
you perform the operation were you able to talk with the relatives of the
victim?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>I was not able to talk with the
relatives of the victim but the victim was brought to the hospital by the
relatives of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> and I was able to talk with
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I was told that she was the wife
and the other older woman who was the mother who gave me the consent and
assured the responsibilities for the patient.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>What
else did you talk about with the relatives of <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
told them that the operation was life saving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That if it was not on time, the patient would die and they agreed to the
operation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Did
