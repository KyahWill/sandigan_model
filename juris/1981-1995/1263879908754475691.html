<blockquote>"ARLENE CABALLES, 14 years old,
single, 2nd Year high school student, residing at <span class="SpellE">Sambag</span>
I, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, testified that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">she is </span>the complainant in nine (9) Criminal Cases Nos. CBU-8473 to
8481, for Rape; against her own father, CIPRIANO CABALLES (Exhibits 'A' to
'I').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is one of the daughters of the
accused and Leonora <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Caballes</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her parents sired four children, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Agnes, the eldest and is 16 years old, then
she is the second, followed by Alvin, 9 years old and then the youngest,
Rosanna, 7 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They resided in
the upper floor of a two-storey house which is two fathoms in width by one and
a half fathoms in length and the entire undivided space is also where the whole
family sleeps.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ground floor
occupants are her grandparents <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> and
Josefina <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>, and her three cousins, who were the
daughters of her aunt <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Julieta</span>,
Dolores and <span class="SpellE">Estela</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On January 9, 1986, her mother, Leonora <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caballes</span>, died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After her mother's death, the family lived in the same place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the evening, the members of the family
retire in the usual place for sleeping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All of them sleep on the floor because there was no bed in their
one-room abode.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her elder sister, Agnes,
stays in one side of the room where their mother while still alive and Agnes
used to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She sleeps beside her
younger brother and younger sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Few
days after the death of her mother she noticed that the attitude of her father
towards her somewhat changed because she was not allowed to go out of the house
while her sisters and brother were free.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She gradually realized that her father wanted to own and possess her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On January 17, 1986, at midnight, while the rest of the
family were sleeping, her father woke her up and whispered to her to
undress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she saw her father naked,
she got scared and did not move.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
of her refusal, her father poked a three-cantos knife at her neck and he
undressed her by pulling down her skirt and her panty until they were removed
from her body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father then told her
to sit up and when she did, he pulled her t-shirt off her head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cried and her father threatened to kill
her if her cries will be heard by others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was frozen with fear and was unable to shout.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lying down totally naked, her father placed
himself on top of her, opened her thighs and slowly inserted his penis into her
vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stayed on top of her for
about four (4) minutes 'panting and he liked it'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt pain in her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">organ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After her father pulled
out his penis, he</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">told her to
dress up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father lied (sic) down on
the place where she earlier slept while she sidled </span>up <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">with her elder sister to avoid being molested
again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of what happened, she did
not sleep well the rest of the evening.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At 4:00 o'clock in the morning, January 18, 1988, she woke <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">up </span>and prepared food for her younger
sister and brother who will go to school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She did not tell her elder sister what their father did to her because
of the threat on her life should she squeal on her father.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On January 19, 1986, she went to sleep together with her
younger brother and sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her elder
sister, Agnes, was washing clothes outside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her father was then out of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>About 11:00 P.M. that evening, her father woke her up and whispered to
her to undress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she did not move,
her father slapped her but she was able to parry his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cried and undressed herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father laid on top of her and inserted
his penis to her vagina and made a push and pull motion for about 4 minutes and
enjoyed his act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After he pulled out his
penis, he put on his brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She wore her
panty and skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father warned her
not to reveal the incident to anyone or he will kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She went back to sleep on the very same place
where she was abused because her father insisted that she sleep with her
younger brother and sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
afraid to disobey for he might step on her or kick her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next day she did not tell her relatives
because of the threat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"About midnight also on January 23, 1986, while she was
sleeping on the floor together with her younger brother and sister and her
elder sister Agnes was sleeping three fathoms away from them on the other side
of the room, she was touched by her father and when she woke up, he told her to
undress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She refused and her father
slashed her duster.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With her duster
torn, her father removed her panty and abused her again with the warning that
she should allow him to do it otherwise he will kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After her father pushed and pulled his penis
while inside her vagina for about three minutes, she felt pain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father put <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">on his </span>brief while she changed clothes
because her duster was already torn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
lied (sic) down back to the same place with her younger brother while her
father slept next to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her elder
sister, Agnes, was as usual sleeping at the other side of the room three meters
away from them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After this third
encounter, she attempted to transfer to her elder sister but out of fear that
she might be maltreated, she had to obey her father's order that she sleep with
her younger brother and sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next
succeeding days she did not tell anyone of her ordeal because of her father's
warning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On January 27, 1986, midnight, her father woke her up and
said that he wants to make love with her again but will not insert his penis
into her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the standing
threat to kill her, she passively acceded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her father removed her skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When she cried, her father pressed his fist on her mouth and it hurt
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So she stopped crying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He removed her panty and took off her
T-shirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He removed his brief and laid
(sic) on top of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he inserted
his penis into her vagina and executed a push and pull movement of his organ
for about five minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he
pulled out his penis, wore his brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She cried and was indignant for having been devoured by her own father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He warned her that if her grandmother
sleeping downstairs will hear her cry, he will kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She put on her clothes and lied (sic) down
with her side towards her younger brother and sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father who was sitting beside her then
fondled her breasts for about a minute, after which he took away his hands,
lied down and went to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She went
back to sleep and woke up (at) 3:00 o'clock in the morning and prepared
breakfast for her younger sister and brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The next day she did not tell her relatives about what has been being
done (sic) to her by her father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
suffered shock and started pondering on her predicament.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The fifth time she was abused by her father was on midnight
of February 12, 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sleeping at that
time <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the one-room house was
her elder sister who was three meters away on one side of the room, and she and
her younger sister and brother on the other side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to sleep beside her elder sister
but the latter told her to sleep with their younger sister and brother because
she might he reprimanded by their father and their father might step on
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So she slept in her usual place
with her younger sister and brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was awakened when her father touched her left side and told her to
undress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father took off his brief and persuaded
her to allow him to make love because he will insert his penis into the vagina
but take it out immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she
did not comply, he threatened to kill her and said why should she refuse when
he will not insert his penis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father
removed her duster first and then her panty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her father fondled her breasts for about three minutes, then laid (sic)
on top of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">her </span>and inserted his
penis slowly into her vagina then he pushed his organ, pulled it and pushed it
again and continued this movement for about four minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After that, his (sic) father pulled out his
penis and put on his brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She slept
beside her younger sister while her father slept beside her and kept on
fondling her breasts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, she parried
his hands and he got mad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At 4:00
o'clock in the morning, he woke up and prepared the food for her younger sister
and brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By daytime, she did not
tell any of her relatives what her father did to her that night and on previous
nights because he always threatened to kill her if she tells on him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She took a bath and hurriedly washed her
panty for fear of being detected by others that her own father abused her and
he (father) might maltreat her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this
fifth sexual incident she has had with her father, her 16 year old elder
sister, Agnes, became aware already because she herself confided to her that
while she was sleep, her father also fondled her breasts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At midnight of February 28, 1986, while sleeping in their
one-room house with her elder sister, younger brother and sister, her left side
was touched by her father who told her to take off her jogging pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she defied, her father spread her thighs
and forcibly opened wide the garter of her jogging pants and pulled it down and
then he took off subsequently her panty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She refused the advances but her father scolded her and told her not to
refuse because he will not insert his penis into her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He took off his brief, laid on top of her and
again inserted his penis into her vagina and for about three minutes, he pushed
and pulled his organ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And again she
cried because of what her own father has done to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She noticed something wet on her vagina but
didn't know what it was all about.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
does not know what an orgasm is because before her father, she has not yet met
a man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He put on his brief and slept
beside her younger brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although her
elder sister, Agnes, sleeps within the confines of their one-room house three meters
away from her and her younger brother and sister, she wanted to sleep with
Agnes but could not for fear of being stepped on or kicked by her father
because in the past, she was already kicked by her father twice for trying to
avoid him by sleeping with her elder sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And so, as usual, she woke up at 4:00 o'clock in the morning and
prepared food for her younger sister and brother who will be going to
school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not tell her aunt nor
any relative of what her father has been doing to her because she was
forewarned and threatened to be killed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the evening of March 19, 1986, she went to sleep with her
T-shirt and shorts and panty on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
midnight, her father woke her up and told her to undress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She refused and told her father not to molest
her because she is his very own daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her father countered that he will make love again and she should not be
afraid because he will not insert his penis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She cried because she does not believe him anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father had only his brief and she noticed
his penis bulging inside the brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
taking off his brief, she saw his erected penis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father then laid on top of her, thrust
his penis into her vagina and for about three minutes of push and pull
movement, her father stopped and put on his brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cried while putting on her panty and
shorts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the rest of the evening she
was unable to sleep because her father slept beside her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By 4:00 o'clock <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in </span>the morning, while her father was still sleeping, she got up
and cooked for their breakfast and prepared the food for her younger sister and
brother who were schooling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the
time she was abused, her elder sister Agnes was sleeping in the place where she
used to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At daytime, she had a
conversation with her grandmother, aunt, elder sister and some cousins but she
never mentioned what her father has been doing to her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the midnight of March 29, 1986, while sleeping in their
one room house beside her younger brother, her father transferred her younger
brother and told her to take off her duster.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She refused and pleaded with her father to spare her because she is his
own flesh.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father pressed his fist
on her mouth and then pulled her strapless duster <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">with his </span>two hands from the garter above her breast and way down
below.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then her father took off forcibly
also her panty that one side was partially torn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After she was totally naked, her father took
off his briefs and laid on top of her, stuck his penis into her vagina and
pulled it, pushed it again and again for about three minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His usual warning was not to tell anyone
about his acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he put on his
underwear, slept beside her younger sister, while she put back her panty and
duster and slept beside her younger brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As usual, her elder sister Agnes was just sleeping in her usual place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She got up at 4:00 o'clock in the morning and
prepared the food for breakfast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On April 5, 1986, midnight, while sleeping beside her younger
brother in their one-room house, her father transferred her younger brother and
placed the latter beside her younger sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then her father told her to take off her city short pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She refused and told her father she cannot
bear anymore what he has been doing to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He pressed his fist against her mouth and she felt pain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her father, who was sitting near her feet
while she was lying on her back, forcibly pulled down her shorts, destroying
the button and the lock of the zipper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When her shorts was taken off, her father pulled down also her panty,
leaving her T-shirt on only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she
was naked from the waist down, her father took off his underwear and laid on
top of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He inserted his penis into
her vagina and undulated for about three minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cried looking at her father during three
minutes of his sexual self-satisfaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, his father placed on his underwear and she dressed up and
slept beside her younger sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
night her sleep was on and off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By 4:00
o'clock in the morning, she got up and prepared the breakfast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After April 5, 1986, when she could no longer bear the evil
deeds of her father, she planned to run away from home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Agnes, her elder sister, came to know about
it and requested her (Arlene) that they leave the house together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Agnes confided her fear that she'll be the
next to devoured (sic) by her father because in the past, their father made
some advances on her (Agnes) already.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, her elder sister intimated to her that what has been going on in the
house is not unknown to her (Agnes) because of the sound of the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And so on April 12, 1986, the two sisters
implemented their decision to quit home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They ran away and sought refuge in the house of their uncle, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Lapulapu</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because her uncle was then in Mindanao, the
complainant told the wife of her uncle everything that happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon knowing the whole sordid thing and
fearing that the violent father of her nieces might discover that she was
hiding them and will surely maul her, she (the aunt) transferred the girls to
her sister's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Few days later, the
complainant, accompanied by her elder sister Agnes and their other aunt,
Veronica <span class="SpellE">Bustanillo</span>, reported the matter to the
police headquarters at Ramos Police Station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the arrest of her father, she and her father had a confrontation

approves of the sexual act committed by his father on his sister, Arlene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the act is detestable and odious to
Agnes' conscience, yet Agnes was powerless to talk due to constant fear.</blockquote>

that they were corporal punishments done by a father towards his daughters
whenever they commit mistakes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
remained <span class="SpellE">undenied</span> is that lately, after the accused
had already made sexual advances with complainant, he maltreated his two
teenage daughters without any reason at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

analogous situations and verifiable by human observation and experience.</blockquote>

asleep because she already knew something have (sic) been going on between her
father and her sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, during
the first carnal act, Agnes was awakened by the movement and sound of the mat
and saw her naked father on top of her undressed younger sister who was then
crying, so much so that she (Agnes) shouted enough for them to hear:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'What are you doing there?' Their younger

penetration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">As earlier noted, quite telling is Dr. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo's</span>
testimony on this score:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is it possible that a woman raped 9 times
may still be negative of any presence of spermatozoa?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The lifetime of sperms is more or less 2 days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I examined the patient on April 21 while the
incident happened on April 17, so there was a lapse of 4 days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Normally the lifetime of sperms is 24
hours."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="NUM">III.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot but reject
appellant's contention that the lower court convicted him of the crime of rape
as charged "sans strong and convincing evidence of guilt." Appellant
in this case has done nothing more than to deny having committed the offenses
charged, as most felons are wont to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contrarily, complainant's testimony gives an indubitably credible and
detailed account of the commission of the dastardly acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's mere denial constitutes
self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary
weight than the declaration of credible witnesses on affirmative matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>between <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>positive
and categorical testimony which has a ring of truth on one hand, and a bare
denial on the other, the former is generally held to prevail.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">To our minds, and after a careful evaluation of the facts and the
evidence on record, full reliance may be placed on the prosecution's evidence
which definitely establish, beyond any reasonable doubt, appellant's
culpability for the extremely revolting, reprehensible and unnatural felonies
with which he is charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
he must suffer the full punitive sanctions of the law in expiation of his
criminal and bestial perversion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED, with
the modification that the indemnity to be paid by accused-appellant to
complainant for each crime of rape is increased to P30,000.00 in accordance
with the current jurisprudential rule.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
