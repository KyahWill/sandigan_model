				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the
Revised Rules of Court to annul and set aside the Order dated March 30, 1992 of
respondent Bienvenido E. Laguesma, as Undersecretary of Labor and Employment in
NCR-OD-M-90-11-060, entitled "IN RE:  PETITION FOR CERTIFICATION ELECTION OF ALL SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEES OF THE
PHILIPPINE APPLIANCE CORPORATION (PHILACOR).  GENUINE LABOR ORGANIZATION OF WORKERS IN HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND ALLIED
INDUSTRIES (GLOWHRAIN), petitioner." The order complained of, affirmed the
Order dated August 14, 1991 of Med-Arbiter Rosadali G. Abdullah, allowing
certain employees to participate and cast their votes in the certification
election.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1990, respondent the Genuine Organization of
Workers in Hotel, Restaurant and Allied Industries (GLOWHRAIN) filed with the
Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) a petition for certification election
among the supervisory employees of petitioner, docketed as Case No.
NCR-OD-M-90-11-060 (Annex "C", Rollo, p. 49).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 3, 1991, petitioner filed a "Qualified
Opposition," opposing the petition on the ground that the employees sought
to be represented by respondent GLOWHRAIN are not supervisory employees, as
defined by the Labor Code as amended but are, in fact, managerial employees
exercising one or more managerial prerogatives and functions and that the
genuine supervisory employees having the right to join, assist or form a labor
organization are <span style="">its </span>foremen and
linemen who are already members of the rank-and-file union (Annex
"D", Rollo, p. 53).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 17, 1991, respondent GLOWHRAIN filed its "COMMENT
and POSITION PAPER" attaching therewith supporting documents to show that
union members claimed by petitioner to be managerial employees are supervisors
with recommendatory powers (Rollo, p. 117).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 5, 1991, petitioner filed a "Supplement to
Qualified Opposition," presenting specific instances as evidenced by
company memoranda whereby petitioning employees were shown to have exercised
managerial powers, functions and prerogatives whose decisions were instantly
effective and not merely recommendatory.  In said supplemental opposition, petitioner also alleged that the issue
of whether petitioning employees are managerial employees constituted a
prejudicial question, which should be resolved before any further proceedings
could continue (Annex "E", Rollo, p. 66).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 25, 1991, respondent GLOWHRAIN filed a
"Reply" stating that no prejudicial question existed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 14, 1991, petitioner filed a "Rejoinder,"
explaining the nature of the documents attached to respondent GLOWHRAIN's reply
and describing petitioner's company structure, as well as the corresponding
tasks, duties and responsibilities of petitioning employees in such structure.  It also emphasized that as can be gleaned
from the company structure and the actual functions being performed by the
petitioning employees, the supervisory employees of said company were the
linemen and foremen who were already members of the rank-and-file union (Annex
"F", Rollo, p. 121).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 6, 1991, Med-Arbiter Rosadali C. Abdullah issued an
order directing the holding of a certification election among the supervisory
employees of petitioner.  The
dispositive portion said order reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, on the foregoing consideration, let a
certification election be conducted among the supervisory employees of the
Philippine Appliance Corporation (PHILACOR) within twenty (20) days from
receipt hereof, subject to the usual pre-election conference of the parties to
thresh out the mechanics of the election.  The payroll of the company three (3) months prior to the filing of the
petition shall he used as the basis in determining the list of eligible voters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The choices are:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(a)  GLOWHRAIN - Philippine Appliance Corporation
Supervisor's Association; and</p>

<p class="2Q">(b)  No union <span style="">(Rollo, </span>p. 177).</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the aforestated order, petitioner was required to
submit a list of all supervisory employees of the company based on the payroll
three months prior to the date of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 29, 1991, petitioner filed a "Compliance and
Manifestation," (Annex "H", Rollo, p. 178), attaching two
separate lists of employees.  The first
list (Annex "1", Rollo, p. 208) contained a list of employees
designated as supervisors or equivalent rank.  The second list (Annex "1-A", Rollo, p. 214) contained the
names of employees designated as foremen and linemen whom petitioner deemed as
its genuine supervisory employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1991, petitioner filed a "Motion to Exclude"
those employees listed in Annex "1" alleging that these employees
though occupying positions designated as "Supervisor" are in reality,
managerial employees by virtue of their exercise of managerial functions and
prerogatives which are not merely recommendatory.  Petitioner reiterated its claim that the true supervisors of the
company falling within the scope and definition of the Labor Code are the
company foremen and linemen and some who are occupying the title of
"Supervisor" (Annex "I", Rollo, p. 187).</p>

<p class="BODY">After respondent GLOWHRAIN and petitioner submitted their
respective position papers, the Med-Arbiter issued on August 14, 1991 an order,
the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, an Order is hereby issued,
allowing the employees listed in Annex "1" of the company's Motion to
Exclude dated May 3, 1991 with nos. 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 50, 51,
53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 72, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 86, 87,
89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 98, 99, 100, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108, 110, 111,
112, 116, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131,
132, 133, 134, 136, 139, 140, 146, 149, 151, 154, 155, 157, 161, 162, 163, 164,
167, 170, 174, 176, 177, 178, 182, 184, 185, 187, 188, 192, and those listed in
Annex "1-A" of the same motion with nos. 2, 12, 13, 14, 31, 34, 36,
37, 38, 52, 57, 58, 71, 74, 76, 85, 87 to participate and cast their votes in
the certification election ordered in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let the record of this case be forwarded to the representation
officer concerned and be guided accordingly" (Rollo, p. 224-225).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assailed before the Office of the Secretary of Labor,
the Med-Arbiter's decision allowing petitioning employees to participate in the
certification election.</p>

<p class="BODY">It claimed that the true determination of the nature of the
employment is based on the actual powers and prerogatives exercised by the
employees and not the job titles or descriptions.  It further questioned the MedÂ­-Arbiter's decision as
contradictory to his own express finding of fact that petitioning employees
exercise managerial prerogatives or functions (Annex "L", Rollo, p.
226).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 22, 1991, petitioner's appeal was denied for lack of
merit and the Order of the Med-Arbiter dated August 14, 1991 was affirmed
(Annex "M", Rollo, p. 248).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 6, 1991, petitioner filed a motion for
reconsideration (Annex "N", Rollo, p. 249).  In said motion, petitioner attached for the first time the job
descriptions of its Production Supervisor (Annex "A", Rollo, pp.
259-261), Superintendent (Production) (Annex "B", Rollo, pp. 262-264)
and Manager (Production) (Annex "C", Rollo, p. 265-2<span style="">67).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Resolution dated December 23, 1991, PHILACOR's Motion for
Reconsideration modified the Resolution dated November 22, 1991 by finding that
the employees occupying the job titles of "Production Supervisor,"
"Superintendent Production" and "Production Manager" are
managerial <span style="">employees imbued with
managerial prerogatives, and therefore are ineligible to participate in the
certification election among the supervisory employees (Annex "O",
Rollo, pp. 269-270).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent GLOWHRAIN filed a motion for reconsideration, to which
petitioner filed an "Opposition and Comment."</p>

<p class="BODY">In its motion for reconsideration, respondent GLOWHRAIN
challenged the authenticity of the job descriptions submitted by petitioner,
alleging that the same are irregular having been issued only for the purpose of
buttressing petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 30, 1992, an order was issued granting GLOWHRAIN's
motion for reconsideration and with the following dispositive portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration of petitioner
Genuine Labor Organization of Workers in Hotel, Restaurant and Allied
Industries (GLOWHRAIN) is hereby granted and the Order dated 23 December 1991
is hereby SET ASIDE.  In lieu thereof,
our Resolution dated 22 November 1991 is hereby REINSTATED and AFFIRMED <u>in
toto</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>No further motion of similar nature shall hereinafter be
entertained" (Annex "A", Rollo, pp. 43-44).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his order, respondent Undersecretary of Labor found that the
job descriptions submitted by petitioner were not issued in the regular course
of the business and neither were the concerned employees furnished copies for
them to countersign as an affirmation that the job descriptions are reflective
of their true and actual function, duties and responsibilities.  Furthermore, the respondent Undersecretary
of Labor said there was nothing on record to show that the job descriptions are
the actual functions currently being performed by the concerned employees.  Hence, he concluded that the job descriptions
submitted by petitioner were considered belated issuances and a <span style="">mere </span>afterthought (Rollo, pp. 37-44).</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 13, 1992, petitioner filed a "Manifestation and
Motion (for Reconsideration)" of the Order dated March 30, 1992, which was
denied in an Order dated April 24, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 21, 1992, petitioner filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
with prayer for "a restraining order and/or a writ of preliminary
injunction" to restrain or enjoin the holding of the certification
election (Rollo, pp. 2-36).</p>

<p class="BODY">On June <span style="">29, </span>1992,
the Third Division of this Court resolved "to issue a Temporary
Restraining Order effective as of this date and continuing until otherwise
ordered by this Court" (Rollo, p. 327).</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue to be resolved is whether the petitioning
employees are supervisory employees eligible to form a supervisory union.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the old Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875), the
term "supervisor" was defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2 Definitions - As used in this Act -</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x </span>x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(k)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>'Supervisor' means any
person having authority in the interest of an employer, to hire, transfer,
suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign, recommend, or discipline, other
employees, or responsibly to direct them, and to adjust their grievances, or
effectively to recommend such acts if, in connection with the foregoing, the
exercise of such authority is not of a merely routinary or clerical nature but
requires the use of independent judgment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 442 as amended,
otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, the term
"supervisor" was replaced by the term "managerial
employee."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Code was further amended by Republic Act No. 6715.  Section 4 of the said Republic Act, amended
Article 212 (m), which now contains separate definitions for managerial and
supervisory employees, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 212.  Definitions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(m)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Managerial employee is
one who is vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down and execute
management policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall,
discharge, assign or discipline employees.  <u>Su</u><u><span style="">p</span>ervisor</u><u><span style="">y</span></u> <u>em</u><u><span style="">p</span>lo</u><u><span style="">y</span>ees</u> <u>are</u> <u>those</u> <u>who,</u> <u>in</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>interest</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>employer,</u> <u>effectivel</u><u><span style="">y</span></u>
<u>recommend</u><span style=""> </span><u>such</u><span style=""> </span><u>managerial</u><span style=""> </span><u>actions</u><span style=""> </span><u>if</u> <u>the</u><span style=""> </span><u>exercise</u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u>such</u> <u>authorit</u><u><span style="">y</span></u> <u>is</u><i><span style=""> </span></i><u>not</u>

</span><u>judgment</u><u><span style="">.</span></u><span style="">  </span>xxx"
<span style="">(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The test of "supervisory" or "managerial
status" depends on whether a person possesses authority to act in the
interest of his employer in the manner specified in Article 212 (m) of the
Labor Code and Rule 1(o) of Book V of its Implementing Rules and whether such
authority is not merely routinary or clerical in nature, but requires the use
of independent judgment.  Thus, where
such recommendatory powers as in the case before us, are subject to evaluation,
review and final action by the department heads and other higher executives of
the company, the same, although present, are not effective and not an exercise
of independent judgment as required by law (Franklin Baker Company of the
Philippines v. Trajano, 157 SCRA 416 [1988] citing National Warehouse Corp. <span style="">v. </span>CIR, 7 SCRA 602-603 [1963]).</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful analysis of the record discloses that in the exercise
of the above enumerated managerial powers, petitioning employees are
"given policies to execute and standard policies to observe, thus having
little freedom of action" (National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority v.
NWSA Consolidated, 11 SCRA 766 [1964]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it will be noted that petitioning employees merely
recommend the implementation of management policies or the discipline or
dismissal of subordinates, as may be gleaned from the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the filing/charging of
overtime, petitioning employees are guided by Standard Procedure on
Overtime/Charging (Annex "1-A", Rollo, p. 93; Annex "1-B",
Rollo, p. 94).  The accomplishment of
the "Overtime Work Authority" is the duty <span style="">of </span>the supervisor who must affix his signature therein and
forward the same to the manager who will likewise sign the same.  After which, it will be sent back to the
supervisor concerned.  In the
formulation and issuance of this Management Guide, petitioner admits that
petitioning employees did not participate therein (Annex "F", Rollo,
p. 131).</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the procedure in the hiring of rank-and?file
employees, the immediate supervisor files a notice in writing with the
Personnel Administration asking the latter to find qualified applicants for a
position or job where there is a vacancy.  The Personnel Department proceeds with the recruitment of qualified
applicants, using as <span style="">basis the </span>applicable
set of general standards and the job requirements.  All applicants who are considered by the Personnel Department to
have met both the general and specific requirements of the job are referred to
a panel of four or five supervisors for interview and determination who among
said applicants should be hired for the particular job.  The interview conducted by the panel after
the Personnel Department has already recruited qualified applicants cannot be
said to vest in the supervisors the <span style="">power
</span>to hire.  The said interview
merely involves the accomplishment of an Interview Rating Form, which rates the
interviewee according to his general appearance, manner of speaking, alertness,
physical condition, confidence, ability to get along with others, ability to
present ideas, maturity judgment and technical competence (Annex "4"
&amp; "5", Rollo, pp. 112-113).  The ultimate power to hire still rests with the Manager of the Personnel
Administration (Annex "4", Rollo, p. 111).</p>

<p class="BODY">No evidence was presented by petitioner to bolster its claim that
petitioning employees exercised the power to shorten employees' probationary
period and the power to change the status of or dismiss a casual employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the power to discipline, suspend and discharge employees,
we find that the petitioning employees merely enforce the company rules and
regulations against erring employees.  While it is true that the petitioning employees are the ones who request
for a formal investigation against an erring employee, it is the Corporate
Legal Service which actually conducts the formal investigation and on the basis
of the result of the investigation, the Assistant Vice?President - Human
Resources Management - General Services is the one who imposes the
corresponding penalty.  The supervisor
is merely furnished a copy of the result of the investigation (Annex
"9", Rollo, p. 368; Annex "9-A", Rollo, p. 369).</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="">to </span>the power to
assign or transfer employees, the petitioning employees merely execute the
shifting rotation made by the Plant Manager (Annexes "8",
"8-B", "8-D", "8-E", "8-F",
"9-G", "8-H", Rollo, pp. 359-367).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if petitioner considers petitioning employees as managers,
the fact remains that they do not lay down and execute management policies nor have
the power to hire, but merely recommend such management actions.  As such, petitioning employees will still be
considered supervisors.</p>

<p class="BODY">PHILACOR belatedly presented the job descriptions of the
Production Supervisor, Superintendent (Production) and Manager (Production) to
show that indeed petitioning employees are exercising managerial powers and
prerogatives.  As admitted by PHILACOR,
the aforestated job descriptions were relatively new and were documented only on
or about August 1991 after the Med-Arbiter had already ordered the
certification election of the petitioning employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">We held in the case of <u>Pagkakaisa ng mga Mangagawa sa Triumph
International - United Lumber and General Workers </u><u><span style="">of </span>the Philippines. v. Ferrer-Calleja</u>,
181 SCRA 119 [1990] that "the fact that their work descriptions are either
managers or supervisors is of no moment considering that it is the nature of
their functions and not the said nomenclatures of titles of their jobs which
determines their statuses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Order dated March 30, 1992 of respondent
Undersecretary of Labor and Employment is AFFIRMED.  The Temporary Restraining Order issued by this Court is LIFTED.</p>
