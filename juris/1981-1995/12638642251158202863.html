defendants including the above-named private respondents, docketed thereat as
Civil Case No. 0010 (PCGG 11), seeking to ‘recover from them ill-gotten wealth

collectively and] in unlawful concert with one another, had acquired and
accumulated in flagrant breach of trust and of their fiduciary obligations as
public officers, with grave abuse of right and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

nation's wealth, extortion, blackmail, bribery, embezzlement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">and </span>other acts of corruption, betrayal

Complaint thus ‘resulting in their unjust enrichment during defendant Ferdinand
E. Marcos’ 20 years of rule from December 30, 1965 to February 25, 1986, first
as President of the Republic of the Philippines under the 1935 Constitution

therein.</blockquote>

later part of August 1987, defendant Jose D. Campos, Jr., having been served
with summons on August 5, 1987, filed with the respondent Court an undated

surrender(ed) or turn(ed) over [any share in his name on any of the
corporations referred to, aside from disclaiming any interest, ownership or
right thereon] to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines’, and that
he was ‘entitled to the immunity granted by the Presidential Commission on Good
Government pursuant to Executive Order No. 14, under the Commission's
Resolution dated May 28, 1986 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

1987, petitioner filed with the respondent Court a 'Motion' seeking to drop
defendant Jose D. Campos, Jr. from the Complaint on the ground that the
Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG for short) had, in a
Resolution dated May 28, 1986, granted immunity to Mr. Jose Y. Campos and his
family, which immunity necessarily extends to defendant Jose D. Campos, Jr. who
is the son of said Mr. Jose Y. Campos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">The main issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the
instant petition hinges on whether or not the petitioner can validly drop Jose

motions for reconsideration on the following grounds.</p>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The PCGG did not
then and does not now have the power to grant civil immunity;</blockquote>

itself<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>rendered in the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> resolution dated May 28, 1986 has not been shown to
cover the transactions involving the corporations and or properties for which
Jose D. Campos, Jr., is now sought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>be
held accountable, i.e., <span class="SpellE">Metroport</span> Services, Inc.;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact is that
nowhere, either in the original motions or in the Motion for Reconsideration
before this Court has it been shown that, save for the alleged unqualified
immunity, there no longer exists any demandable claim against Jose D. Campos,
Jr., arising from the transactions resulting in his being <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, were it not for
the supposed grant of immunity, Jose D. Campos, Jr., would remain liable in the
matter of <span class="SpellE">Metroport</span> Services, Inc., and for the 60%
which Alfredo (<span class="SpellE">Bejo</span>) <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>
acquired therein according to paragraph 14(c) of the Complaint (supra) which
does not appear to have been restored or compensated for." (p. 54, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General asserts that the name
of Jose D. Campos, Jr. was included as defendant in the complaint through
mistake or oversight and that pursuant to section 11, Rule <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">3 of </span>the Revised Rules of Court it has
a right to drop him as defendant without prior consent of any party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General also maintains that
although the defendants in the case were charged <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Campos</st1:place></st1:city>, Jr. was not an
indispensable party since Article 1216 of the Civil Code allows the petitioner
as <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> creditor to choose among the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors against whom it will enforce collection.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose Ca<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">m</span>po<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">s, Jr. </span>adds that the petitioner's
motion to drop him as defendant should be considered as one filed under section
1, Rule 17 of the Revised Rules of Court thus giving it the absolute right to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dismiss </span>the action by mere notice of
dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Above <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">all </span>these
technicalities, the petitioner maintains that the resolutions of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> which ruled that the PCGG does not have the
power to grant civil immunity frustrated the earnest efforts at recovery of
ill-gotten wealth recognized in the Constitution, and Executive Orders Numbers
1, 2, 14 and 14-A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
contends that the non-observance of the immunity provision granted by the PCGG
will hinder the voluntary cooperation of known Marcos c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ronies </span>to enter into amicable settlements <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">compromises </span>with respect to the recovery of ill-gotten
wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner also argues that
the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> power <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>grant criminal immunity under Section 5 of Executive Order
No. 14 carries with it the implied power to enter into compromises and amicable
settlements in line with its duty to recover ill-gotten wealth expeditiously,
efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given these considerations, the petitioner insists that the May
28, 1986<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>resolution of the PCGG
which granted immunity from both civil and criminal prosecution to <u>Jose</u> <u>Y.</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">Campos</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span><u>and</u>
<u>his</u> <u>family</u> is a valid official <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">act of </span>the PCGG and since Jose Campos, Jr. is a legitimate son
of Jose Y. Campos, he must be deemed covered by the grant of immunity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, petitioner-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Campos</st1:place></st1:city>,
Jr. <span class="GramE">states</span> that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
has no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the grant of immunity and
release from civil liability to the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as there </span>is no dispute between him and
the PCGG.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <st1:city><st1:place>Campos</st1:place></st1:city>,
Jr. argues that "Except in a litigation arising from a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">disagreement between the one claiming to be a
beneficiary and the PCGG/Republic, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
is wit</span>ho<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ut competence </span>to
review the validity or extent of the PCGG granted and the Republic supported
grant of immunity from criminal prosecution and release from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">civil </span>liability." (p. 216, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We first ascertain
whether or not the </span><span class="SpellE">S<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the other defendants can still pursue the case and put up their defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tanhu</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span>, <u>(supra)</u>, the main reason why we
did not allow the dropping of two defendants who were charged <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> with the other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">remaining defendants, despite the motion of the plaintiff, is the fact
that the latter filed such motion after the two remaining defendants
defaulted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">In</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>the case at
bar, there is nothing in the record to legally justify the dropping <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the </span>non-defaulted defendants, Lim
and Leonardo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion of <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1974</st1:date> cites none.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From all appearances, plaintiff just decided
to ask for it, without any relevant explanation at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Usually, </span>the court
in granting such a motion inquires for the reasons and in the appropriate
instances directs the granting of some form of compensation for the trouble
undergone by the defendant in answering the complaint, preparing for or
proceeding partially to trial, hiring counsel and making corresponding expenses
in the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing of <span class="GramE">these,</span> appears in the order in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Most importantly, His Honor ought to have
considered that the outright dropping of the non-defaulted defendants Lim and
Leonardo, over their objection at that, would certainly be unjust not only to
the petitioners, their own parents, who would in consequence be entirely
defenseless, but also to Lim and Leonardo themselves who would naturally
correspondingly suffer from the eventual judgment against their parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court paid no heed at all to the
mandate that such dropping must be ‘on such terms as are just’ - meaning to all
concerned with its legal and factual effects."<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no similar reason in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as correctly stated by the herein petitioner:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Under the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">law, the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtor who pays shall have
a right of action against the others for the amount of their respective
shares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, with the dropping of a
defendant who pays his share, the other <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
co-defendants are also benefited to the extent of that paid share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Truly, each <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
debtor ends up paying his own share, including the defendant who </span>had
been dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is no
injustice." (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>
