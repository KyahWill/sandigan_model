This is a review en consulta of the decision of the Regional Trial Court
 of Oriental Mindoro, Calapan Branch 40, convicting Faustino Martinez y 
Lalongisip of rape with homicide, sentencing him to death and ordering 
him to indemnify the heirs of the minor, Merle Aquino, in the sum of 
twelve thousand pesos (Criminal Case No. C-1917).
<p>
Faustino Martinez, 24, single, a sawer and a resident of Barangay 
Dulangan, Baco, Oriental Min­doro, was convicted of homicide in 1981 by 
Judge Aguila in Criminal Case No. 547 of the Court of First Instance at 
Calapan, Oriental Mindoro.  He was sen­tenced to two years, four months 
and one day of <em>prision correccional</em> to eight years of <em>prision mayor</em>.
  He was confined in the provincial jail.  The anomaly was that for more
 than two years he was awaiting transfer to the New Bilibid Prison.
</p><p>
On May 1, 1983, Oliva, a provincial guard Stationed at Pinamalayan, with
 the consent of Benjamin M. Cueto, Sr., the provincial warden, brought 
Martinez to Victoria to gather firewood to be used at his wedding and 
left him there.  Oliva intended to fetch Martinez on his return to 
Calapan.  (Nos. 14-15, Exh. E.)
</p><p>
In the evening of May 18, 1983 there was a dance at Barangay Merit, Victoria.  It was the climax of the <em>Flores de Mayo</em>.
   At that dance, Martinez (the convict who should be languishing in the
 provincial jail at Calapan) met an acquaintance, Merle Aquino, 18, 
single.  Their parents were <em>compadres</em>.  Martinez used to be a 
hired hand of Merle's father, Rodolfo Aquino, and lived for a long time 
in his house (No. 18, Exh. I-1).
</p><p>
The dance ended at about one o'clock in the morning of May 19.  Merle 
was to be escorted to her home at Barangay Bambanin by Martinez.  
Orlando Perez, 14, offered to accompany them but Martinez threatened to 
box him if he did so (No. 6, Exh. H), So, only Merle and Martinez 
proceeded to Bambanin.
</p><p>
On reaching a coconut grove in Bambanin, Martinez suddenly held Merle.  He said: "Hinawakan ko po siya sa kamay at <em>pinilit kong itinumba</em> sa lupa at hinila kong pababa ang kanyang panty hanggang sa hita at pinagsamantalahan ko siya." (No. 21, Exh. D.)
</p><p>
Asked why he killed Merle since he had already sexual congress with her,
 Martinez said that she threatened to report the matter to her father. 
"Kaya siya ay sinaksak ko hanggang siya ay mamatay." (No. 22, Exh. D.)
</p><p>
The body was found the following day in a malodorous state with plenty 
of maggots (Exh. C).  The autopsy disclosed that her hymen and vulvar 
orifice were lacerated at the six o'clock position.  As an indication of
 the beastliness of the sexual assault, <em>the laceration extended to the anal opening</em>.  Merle sustained <em>nineteen (19) stab wounds</em>
 on different parts of the body.  The first listed stab wound was on the
 chest, four inches deep.  It penetrated the heart and was evidently 
fatal (Exh. A and A-1).
</p><p>
The provincial fiscal charged him with rape with homicide.  At his 
arraignment, the information was read to him in Tagalog.  The trial 
judge asked him: "Ipinahihiwatig ng inyong manananggol na itinalaga ng 
Hukumang ito na ikaw, Faustino Martinez y Lalongisip, ay kusang loob at 
handang <em>umamin </em>sa kasalanang panggagahasa at pagpatay, ito ba ay totoo?" He unhesitatingly answered in the affirmative.
</p><p>
The trial judge apprised him that a plea of guilty would mean the 
imposition of the death penalty upon him.  He answered spontaneously 
that he was aware of the con­sequences of that plea.  He pleaded guilty.
  He was assisted by counsel.  The trial court required the pro­secution
 to present its evidence.
</p><p>
After the prosecution had finished the presentation of its evidence, 
Martinez took the witness stand.  He was interrogated by his counsel.  
He testified that the charge of rape with homicide against him was "the 
truth" (4 tsn June 22, 1983).  He admitted that at the arraign­ment, 
lawyer Turano of the Citizens Legal Assistance Office advised him that 
if he pleaded guilty he would be sentenced to death and that in spite of
 that advice he entered a plea of guilty (8).  He ratified his 
confession, Exhibits D and E (8-10).
</p><p>
For the rape with homicide, a capital offense <em>par excellence</em>, 
the penalty under article 335, in relation to articles 160 and 63 of the
 Revised Penal Code, is death which is imposable regardless of the 
generic mitigating and aggravating circumstances attending that special 
complex offense. (People vs. Pascual, Jr., G. R. No. 53403, November 12,
 1981, 109 SCRA 197; People vs. Saligan, L-39712, November 21, 1980, 101
 SCRA 264; People vs. Laspardas, L-46146, October 23, 1979, 93 SCRA 638;
 People vs. Yutila, L-32791, January 27, 1981, 102 SCRA 264; People vs. 
Vizcarra, L-38859 July 30, 1982, 115 SCRA 743 and People vs. Umali, 
L-35705, August 21, 1982, 116 SCRA 23.)
</p><p>
Counsel <em>de oficio</em> for Martinez, in his manifestation in lieu of
 a brief, regretfully confessed that after a conscientious study he 
could not make any assignment of errors.  However, he submitted that <em>reclusion perpetua </em>would be the appropriate penalty.  The Solicitor General manifested that it was unnecessary to file an appellee's brief.
</p><p>
Finding no error in the imposition of the death penalty, the trial court's judgment is affirmed with costs <em>de oficio</em>.
</p><p>
A copy of this decision should be furnished the Minister of Justice for 
such action as he may deem necessary to take against the provincial 
warden and guard mentioned in the decision.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
