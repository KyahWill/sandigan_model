</span>The question of damages raised is merely incidental to that main
issue." The Court rejected the stockholders' theory of excluding his
complaint (for replacement of a lost stock (dividend) certificate which he
claimed to have never received) from the classification of intra-corporate
controversies as one that "does not square with the intent of the law,
which is to segregate from the general jurisdiction of regular Courts
controversies involving corporations and their stockholders and to bring them
to the SEC for exclusive resolution, in much the same way that labor disputes
are now brought to the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) and the National
Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), and not to the Courts."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
