<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There is no question that
the institution of a crimi­nal action is addressed to the sound discretion of
the in­vestigating fiscal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may or he
may not file the informa­tion according to whether the evidence is in his
opinion sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
doubt (Gonzales vs. Court of First Instance, 63 Phil. 846) and when he decides
not to file the informa­tion, in the exercise of his discretion, he may not be
com­pelled to do so (People vs. Pineda, 20 SCRA 748).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after the case had already been
filed in court, "fiscals are not clothed with power, without the consent

</span>This is, as it should be, because the case is already in court and,

was a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case against private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question pre<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">sented for determination now is - after a case has been filed in court,
can a fiscal be compelled to prosecute the same, after his motion to dismiss it
has been denied?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">This court is of the view
that the writ prayed for should issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Notwithstanding his personal convictions or opinions, the fiscal must
proceed with his duty of presenting evidence to the court to enable the court
to arrive at its own independent judgment as to the culpability of the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal should not shirk
from his respon</span>sibility much less leave the prosecution of the case at
the hands of a private prosecutor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
all times, the criminal action shall be prosecuted under his direction and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">control (Sec. 4, Rule 110, <span class="GramE">Rules</span>
of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the entire

70 SCRA 361).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"In the trial of
criminal cases, it is the duty of the public prosecutor to appear for the
government since an offense </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">an outrage to the sovereignty of the
State" (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. IV, 1980 Ed., p.
10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so because "the
prosecuting officer is the representative not of an ordinary party to a
controver­sy but of a sovereignty where obligation to govern impar­tially is as
compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore,
in criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall
be done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, he is in a peculiar
and very definite sense the servant of the law, the two-fold aim of which is
that </span>guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer" (Suarez vs. <span class="SpellE">Platon</span>, 69 Phil. 556).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Accordingly, if the
fiscal is not at all convinced that a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case exists, he
simply cannot move for the dismissal of the case and, when denied, refuse to
prosecute the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is obliged by law
to proceed and prosecute the criminal action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He cannot impose his opinion </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At least </span>what
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">he can do is to conti­nue appearing for
the prosecution and then turn over the presentation of evidence to another fiscal
or a private prosecutor subject to his direction and control (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Despabiladeras</span>, 32 Phil. 442; </span>U.S. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vs. Gallegos, 37 </span>Phil. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">289).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where there </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">no other
prosecutor available, he should proceed to discharge his duty and present the
evi­dence to the best of his ability and let the court decide the merits of the
case on the basis of the evidence adduced by both parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The mere fact that the
Secretary of Justice had, after reviewing the records of the case, directed the
prosecuting </span>fiscal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to move for
the dismissal of the case and the </span>motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">to dismiss filed pursuant to said directive is denied by the trial
court, is no justification for the refusal of the fiscal to prosecute the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the court where the case is
filed and not the fiscal that has full control of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Very recently, this Court in Mario Fl. <span class="SpellE">Crespo</span> vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Leodegario</span> L.
Mogul (G.R. No. 53373, promulgated June 30, 1987) ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to do with the case before it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and
competence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion to dismiss the case
filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to
grant or deny the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not
matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the ac­cused or that
the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the
Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
