<p class="BODY">Petitioner does not dispute the finding that there were anomalies
in the <span class="SpellE">Siquijor</span> Highway Engineering District
(SHED).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does he dispute the
existence of a conspiracy between the suppliers and certain government
officials and employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What he
vehemently denies is the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span> finding that
he was a conspirator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, for purposes of this petition we will no longer inquire
into whether or not the offenses charged were in <span style="">fact </span>committed, but shall limit ourselves to the issue of
whether or not petitioner's participation in the criminal <span style="">conspiracy </span>has been established beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> found that
petitioner's liability, as District Auditor, emanated from his irregular and
improper processing, pre-audit and approval of all the general vouchers and
checks in question, based on irregular or fake supporting papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The graft court found that he also signed and
passed in audit the vouchers and checks knowing that these were illegally
funded and improperly charged to "Fund 81-400" (the prior year's
obligations), and engaged in "splitting," so that he would be the one
to pass the vouchers in audit when such should have been forwarded to the
Commission on Audit (COA) Regional Auditor for action or review. [Decision, p.
83; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 113.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> described the details
of the "splitting" resorted to as follows:</p>

<blockquote><u>Fifthly</u>, based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the
accused district officials resorted to "splitting" of <span class="SpellE">RSEs</span>, POs (Purchase Orders) and <span class="SpellE">GVs</span>
in order to avoid review or approval by higher authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under COA Circular No. 76-41, dated July 30,
1976, in relation to COA Circular No. 16-16A, dated February 10, 1976, of which
the Court takes judicial notice, it is provided that "Resident Auditors of
bureaus, offices and agencies of the National Government in Metropolitan
Manila, as well as other <u>Auditors</u> <u>for</u> <u>District/City</u> <u>Highway</u>,
Public Works/School, State Colleges and Universities, Military Areas and Zones
outside Metropolitan Manila, are authorized to countersign checks and warrants
in <u>amounts</u> <u>not</u> <u>exceeding</u> <u>P50,000.00</u> <u>in</u> <u>each</u>
<u>case</u>" (Underlining supplied).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, all <span class="SpellE">GVs</span> in amounts exceeding P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> must have to be processed, pre-audited and approved
by the <u>Regional</u> <u>Auditor</u> of the COA, instead of SHED resident
auditor Jose <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, one of the accused herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, in the very wording of COA Circular No. 76-41, "to avoid
action, review or approval by higher authorities", the district officials
herein resorted to the splitting of the <span class="SpellE">RSEs</span>, POs,
and the <span class="SpellE">GVs</span> involved in the fake LAA dated <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1977</st1:date> in the amount of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said LAA
evolved into three (3) separate transactions involving the amounts of
P48,480.00, P48,480.00 and P48,189.60 as evidenced by three <span class="SpellE">GVs</span>,
dated December 21, December 21 and December 23, 1977, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, if such transactions were to be
reviewed and pre-audited by the Regional (COA) Auditor, who might be averse to
joining the conspiracy, then the <span class="SpellE">GVs</span> and supporting
papers may be found to be the result of (1) inexistent programs of work, (2)
illegal funding, (3) irregular or non-existent bidding, (4) fictitious
deliveries and inspection, and other anomalies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the Court considers such "splitting" as an
integral and/or essential element or link in the conspiracy to defraud the
Government inasmuch as such practices was (sic) consciously and deliberately
resorted to in order to hide the massive and stupefying misappropriations being
undertaken by the accused herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">[Decision, <span style="">pp. </span>75-76;
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 105-106; underscoring in the original.]</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But petitioner vigorously argues his innocence, alleging his
non-participation in the conspiracy and his good faith in attaching his
signature to the documents involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
contends that it has not been shown that he falsified any of the documents
which the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> found to be falsifications.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while he admits that he signed the general vouchers, he
claims that his act of doing so was merely ministerial considering that all the
supporting papers and documents were submitted and attached to the
vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continues that he could not
question the veracity of the prepared Letters of Advice of Allotments (LAA) and
Sub-Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (SACDC) since these documents, with
the program of work accompanying them and other inspection reports, gave him
the go-signal to pass them in audit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, he claims that the vouchers would have been cleared even
without his signature as they were supported by the required documents and
certifications.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument cannot be given much weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has already been rejected by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>None of the accused regional and district officials can claim good
faith or reliance on the regularity of the documents processed and signed by
them or on the presumption that their subordinates and/or superiors have acted
regularly, since by the very nature of their duties, <b><u>they</u> <u>should</u>
<u>have</u> <u>known</u> <u>or</u> <u>realized</u> <u>by</u></b><b><span style=""> </span><u>mere</u> <u>scrutiny</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>documents</u> <u>o</u>r <u>by</u></b><b><span style=""> </span><u>the</u></b><b><span style=""> </span><u>exercise</u>
<u>of</u> <u>ordinary</u> <u>diligence</u> <u>that</u> <u>there</u> <u>were</u>
<u>irregularities</u> <u>or</u> <u>anomalies</u> <u>reflected</u> <u>on</u> <u>their</u>
<u>very</u> <u>faces</u></b>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
exemplified by several circumstances <b><u>patent</u></b> on said documents, to
wit, the irregular funding of the <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>; the improper
charging to prior year's obligations; the unauthorized and/or improper action
by officials on the supporting documents; the lack or incompleteness of
supporting documents, and the splitting of payments. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Neither can the accused-contractors claim good
faith likewise and reliance on the actuations of their co-accused public
officials since they knew fully well that their participation in the
transactions under question were only make-believe or a farce, and that their
names, business standing and signatures were only utilized, with their
whole-hearted cooperation, in seeking the consummation of their plans to
defraud the government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">[Decision, pp. 85-86; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 115-116; underlining ours.]</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Clearly, given his acts
and omissions in auditing the documents, <b><u>which</u> <u>related</u> <u>not</u>
<u>only</u> <u>to</u></b></span><b><span style=""> </span></b><b><u><span style="">one</span></u></b><b><span style=""> </span></b><b><u><span style="">but</span></u></b><b><span style=""> </span></b><b><u><span style="">to</span></u></b><b><span style=""> </span></b><b><u><span style="">several</span></u></b><b><span style=""> </span></b><b><u><span style="">transactions</span></u></b><span style="">, </span><span style="">petitioner's participation in the conspiracy
to defraud the Government has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that there need not be
direct evidence of the existence and details of the conspiracy [People v. <span class="SpellE">Romuladez</span>, 57 Phil. 148 (1932); People v. <span class="SpellE">Cadag</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-13830, </span></span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5"><span class="GramE"><span style="">May 31, 1961</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, 2 SCRA 388.]</span></span><span style=""> Like the guilt of the individual offender,
the existence of a conspiracy and a conspirator's participation may be
established through circumstantial evidence [<u>Ibid</u>.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner, as resident
auditor of the SHED was tasked with ensuring the regularity of <u>all</u>
transactions that are subject to his review.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In these cases, he had before him, for his signature, vouchers that were
patently irregular, supported by similarly irregularly issued documents, which
he should not have passed in audit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of refusing to affix his signature and reporting the
irregularities to his superiors, as he was duty bound to do, he turned a blind
eye and signed the documents, completing the process that led to the
consummation of the </span><span style="">crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He can not rely on the excuse that his subordinates have already
initialed the documents for his signature because his <span style="">function, as </span>their superior, is to check on their work and to
ensure that they do it correctly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, if his signature was a superfluity, petitioner would be
serving no useful purpose in occupying his position of resident auditor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The number of transactions in which petitioner is involved and
the magnitude of the amount involved also prevent a reasonable mind from
accepting the proposition that petitioner was merely careless or negligent in
the performance of his functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
passed in audit twenty-four (24) general vouchers which resulted in the
issuance of twenty-three (23) checks amounting to Nine Hundred Eighty-Two
Thousand Two Hundred Seven Pesos and Sixty Centavos (P982<span class="GramE">,207.60</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the irregularities were not of the
kind that could have gone unnoticed by the trained eyes of an auditor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, it may be that
petitioner has already been administratively penalized for his malfeasance, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">in fact </span>he<span style=""> was suspended
for one (1) year without pay [Annex "A" of the Reply; </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p<span style="">p.
189-200], but such will not bar his conviction under the general penal
laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Administrative liability is
separate and distinct from penal liability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In sum, no reversible
error </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">committed by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
in adjudging petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span><span style="">the
petition is </span><span style="">hereby </span><span style="">DENIED, </span><span style="">and the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
