commercial enterprises set up ostensibly for purposes concerned with the
development of the coconut industry and the welfare of those involved in or
served by it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These agencies or
enterprises were organized and financed with revenues derived from coconut
levies imposed under a succession of laws of the late dictatorship and are
alleged to have been thereafter used as conduits to perpetrate "the most
stupendous <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds in the annals
of our history," as the PCGG puts it,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
with depose President Ferdinand Marcos and his cronies as the suspected authors
and chief beneficiaries of the resulting "coconut industry monopoly."</p>

<p class="BODY">The action is denominated a class suit of the COCOFED, a private
national association of coconut producers which by legal mandate receives
allocations from the coconut levy funds to finance its operating expenses and
projects; the Coconut Investment Company (CIC), the first government
corporation created to administer the coconut levy funds (as will later be
explained in some detail); and individual petitioners Maria Clara <span class="SpellE">Lobregat</span> and some 37 other persons, all claiming to be
either coconut farmers, coconut workers or stockholders of the sequestered
companies, bringing suit for themselves and in representation of "the more
than one million coconut farmers who are similarly situated" upon a claim
of private interest in the sequestered assets and properties.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>The COCONUT LEVY FUNDS</u>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The sequestration of the corporations and the other acts
complained of were undertaken by the PCGG preparatory to the filing of suit in
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> against Marcos and his associates
for the illicit conversion of the coconut levy funds, purportedly channeled
through the COCOFED and the other sequestered businesses, into private
pelf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These funds fall into four general
classes, <u>viz</u>.:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the Coconut
Investment Fund created under R.A. 6260 (effective June 19, 1971); (b) the
Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund created under PD 276 (effective August 20,
1973); (c) the Coconut Industry Developments Fund created under PD 582
(effective November 14, 1974); and (d) the Coconut Industry Stabilization Fund
created under P.D. 1841 (effective October 2, 1981).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Coconut Investment Fund, or CIF, was put up in 1971 by R.A.
6260 which declared it to be the national policy to accelerate the development
of the coconut indus­try through the provision of adequate medium and long term
financing for capital investment in the industry.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

membership"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>

to be petitioner COCOFED.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CIF was to be used exclusively to pay for the Philippine
Government's subscription to the capital stock<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Coconut Investment Company (CIC), a corporation with a capitalization of
P100,000,000.00 created by the statute to administer the Fund, as has already
been stated, and to invest its capital in financing "agricultural,
industrial or other productive (coconut) enterprises" qualified under the
terms of the statute to apply for loans with the CIC.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The State was to initially subscribe to <span class="SpellE">CIC's</span> capital
stock "for and on behalf of the coconut farmers," to whom such shares
were <span class="SpellE">suppposed</span> to be transferred "upon full
payment (with the collections on the levy) of the authorized capital stock * *
or upon termination of a ten-year period from the start of the collection of
the levy * *, whichever comes first."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The scheme, in short, called for the use of the CIF -- funds collected mainly
from coconut farmers -- to pay for the CIC shares of stock to be subscribed by
the Government and held by it until the levy was lifted, whereupon the
Government was to "convert" the receipts issued to the farmers (as
evidence of payment of the levy) "into shares of stock" -- this time
in the farmer names -- <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in the new,
private corporation to be formed by them at such time, conformably with the
provisions of the law.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Stabilization Fund Levy" of fifteen pesos (P15.00) on the first sale

which was to be used to subsidize the sale of coconut-based products at prices
set by the Price Control Council, in order to stabilize the price of edible oil

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1974</st1:date>,
PD 582 was promulgated setting up yet another "permanent fund * * (this

The fund was denominated the Coconut Industry Development Fund, or the
CIDF.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its initial capital of P100
million was to be paid from the CCSF, and in addition to this, the PCA was
directed to thereafter remit to the fund "an amount equal to at least

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>The Coconut Industry
Investment Fund (CIF</u>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The various laws relating to the coconut industry were codified
in 1976; promulgated on October 21 of that year was PD 961 or the "Coconut
Industry Code," which later came to be known as the "Revised Coconut
Industry Code" upon its amendment by PD 1468, effective <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Code provided for the continued
enforcement of the Stabilization Fund Levy imposed by PD 276 and for the use of
the CCSF and the CIDF for substantially the same purposes specified by the
enactments ordaining their creation.</p>

<p class="BODY">A new provision was however inserted in the Code, authorizing the
use of the balance of the CIDF not needed to finance the replanting program and
other authorized projects, for the acquisition of "shares of stock in
corporations organized for the purpose of engaging in the establishment and
operation of industries, * * commercial activities and other allied business
undertakings relating to coconut and other palm oil <span class="SpellE">industr</span>(<span class="SpellE">ies</span>)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
From this fund thus created, the Coconut Industry Investment Fund or the CIIF,
were purchased the shares of stock in what have come to be known as the
"CIIF companies" -- the sequestered corporations into which said CIIF
(Coconut Industry Investment Fund) was heavily invested after its creation.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>The Coconut Industry

However, on <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1981</st1:date>,
PD 1841 was issued reviving the levies and renaming the CCSF the Coconut

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>The AGENCIES INVOLVED</u>:</p>

the Philippine Coconut Authority or the PCA was created on June 30, 1973 by
P.D. 232 to replace and assume the functions of (1) the Philippine Coconut
Administration or PHILCOA (which had been established in 1954), (2) the Coconut
Coordinating Council (CCC), and (3) the Philippine Coconut Research Institute
(PHILCORIN).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of the Decree,
the PCA took over the collection of the CIF Levy under RA 6260 in 1973, while
subsequent statutes, to wit, PD 276 (in relation to PD 414), PD 582, and PD
1841, empowered it specifically to manage the CCSF, the CIDF, and the CISF,
from the time of their creation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
the laws just mentioned, the PCA, as the government arm that "formulate(s)

acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners posit that:</p>

<p class="NUM">1) the PCGG has no jurisdiction over the sequestered properties as
the powers conferred upon it by Executive Orders Numbered 1, 2 and 14 extend
only to ill-gotten wealth of "former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and/or

and not to the private properties of the coconut farmers and the petitioners,
who do not fall under any of the classes of persons specified under the Orders;</p>

<p class="NUM">2) the sequestered properties are not ill-gotten wealth of the
petitioners whose ownership of the shares of stock in the COCOFED, the CIIF
companies, and the UCPB resulted from lawful disbursements of the coconut levy
fund; and</p>

<p class="NUM">3) the sequestration of the petitioners' private properties is a
gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion on the part of PCGG and, <span class="SpellE">corollarily</span>, rendered enforcement of E. O. s 1, 2 and 14 as

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>PCA INTERVENTION<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">A petition-in-intervention presented by the PCA was admitted by

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>THE PCGG POSITION<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, for the PCGG, submits that the funds
collected from the coconut levy are public funds which no amount of
pronouncements to the contrary -- by decree or any other presidential issuance
-- can convert into private money; that in the light of the report of the
Commission on Audit of its examination of the funds made after the
unceremonious deposal of President Marcos, to the effect that the funds were
misappropriated and squandered by the latter, his cronies and the leaders of
the coconut industry, it is the duty of PCGG to recover the same and, pending
recovery proceedings, to make use of its power of sequestration and other
remedies conferred by Executive Orders 1, 2 and 14.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his view, the so-called "more than
one million coconut farmers" do not own the coconut levy funds or the
assets acquired therewith.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>The question of the
validity of PCGG sequestration and freeze orders as provisional measures to
collect and conserve the assets believed to be ill-gotten wealth has been laid
to rest in <u>BASECO vs. PCGG</u> (150 SCRA 181) where this Court held that
such orders are not confiscatory but only preservative in character, not
designed to effect a confiscation of, but only to conserve properties believed
to be ill-gotten wealth of the ex-president, his family and associates, and to
prevent their concealment, dissipation, or transfer, pending the determination
of their true ownership.</p>

<blockquote>"Nor may it be gainsaid that pending the institution of the
suits for the recovery of such 'ill-gotten wealth' as the evidence at hand may
reveal, there is an obvious and imperative need for preliminary, provisional
measures to prevent the concealment, disappearance, destruction, dissipation,
or loss of the assets and properties subject of the suits, or to restrain or
foil acts that may render moot and academic, or effectively hamper, delay, or
negate efforts to recover the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"To answer this need, the law has prescribed three (3)
provisional remedies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) sequestration; (2) freeze orders; and (3)
provisional takeover." (at p. 208)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG exercised the powers conferred upon it by Executive
Orders Numbered 1, 2 and 14 on the basis of evidence in its possession which it
deemed sufficient to show, <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>, that former President
Marcos, Mr. Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>, Jr., the COCOFED and
its national leaders, collaborated with each other to perpetrate the
"systematic plunder" of the funds generated by the coconut levy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That preliminary determination finds support
in the documents and evidence relative thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reports, for example, from the Commission on Audit (COA) which audited
the funds after the February 1986 Revolution tend to show that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(1) of the funds
allocated to COCOFED, some P20 million were delivered to Mrs. Imelda R. Marcos
for the Imelda <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> Marcos Scholarship Program
of which no accounting has been made;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(2) COCOFED
purchased an aircraft at a total cost of P11,849,071.29;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(3) COCOFED
disbursement of P23 million for the account of the Census Committee which
undertook the survey of coconut farmers to determine other farmers entitled to
the <span class="SpellE">unissued</span> shares of UCPB, was under-reimbursed by
P3,584,826.36;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(4) cash advances
in hundreds of thousands of pesos granted by COCOMARK to COCOFED officials Jose
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Morente</span>, <span class="SpellE">Inaki</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendezona</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Marquez and
Maria Clara <span class="SpellE">Lobregat</span> were <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(5) COCOMARK made
disbursements for cash advances for travel and transportation expenses to its
directors who are also directors of COCOFED without supporting documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigation by the PCGG of the funds supposed to have been
invested in the UCPB on behalf of the coconut farmers, also reveal that UCPB
shares appearing in the UCPB books as issued to 1,405,366 coconut farmers are
not in fact owned by the said persons because a large number of them sold their
stock to national and local officials of COCOFED at the latter's initiative;
and documents found in <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> in the wake of the
February 1986 people's revolution tend to show that Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>,
Jr., apart from owning his own shares in UCPB, also "fronted" for the
shares of Mr. Marcos in that bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the coconut levy funds invested in the CIIF com­panies for
the benefit of coconut farmers, COA findings adverted to by the PCGG disclose
that said funds were invested in companies most of which were or became
vehicles to effectuate their misuse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
United Coconut Oil Mills, Inc. (UNICOM), a CIIF funded company, for example, appears
to have spent millions of pesos to acquire non-operating and unprofitable
coconut oil mills owned by persons close to the <span class="SpellE">Marcoses</span>;
that P840 million of the CIDF were siphoned off to Agricultural Investors,
Inc., a corporation owned and controlled by Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>,
Jr., which has a paid-up capital of only P100,000; and that P41.9 million worth
of <span class="SpellE">seednuts</span> equivalent to 24.48% of the total
purchases of UCPB using CIDF from 1979 to 1982 had not been accounted for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reports were also cited showing that only
75.52% of the total <span class="SpellE">seednuts</span> purchased had been
distributed to the participants of the replanting program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG also claims to have in its
possession evidence of other instances of misuse or misappropriation of the
coconut levy funds attributable to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners deny the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>
postulations and assertions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of course not for this Court to pass upon the factual
issues thus raised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That function
pertains to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in the first
instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of this
proceeding, all that the Court needs to determine is whether or not there is <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> justification for the sequestration ordered by the PCGG.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court is satisfied that there is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cited incidents, given the public
character of the coconut levy funds, place petitioners COCOFED and its leaders
and officials, at least <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>, squarely within the purview
of Executive Orders Nos. 1, 2 and 14, as construed and applied in <u>BASECO</u>,
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that ill-gotten

instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions, or by taking
undue advantage of their office, authority, influence, connections or

prejudice to the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) that ‘said assets

shares of stocks, buildings, shopping centers, condominiums, mansions,

<p class="NUM">2. The petitioners' claim that the assets acquired with the
coconut levy funds are privately owned by the coconut farmers is founded on
certain provisions of law, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>7.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Incorporation as a private entity under Act
Numbered One Thousand Four Hundred Fifty-Nine, as amended. - Upon full payment
of the authorized capital stock, as evidenced by receipts issued for levies
paid, or upon termination of a ten-year period from the start of the collection
of the levy as provided in Section eight hereof, whichever comes first, the
shares of stock held by the Philippine Government for and in behalf of the
coconut farmers shall be transferred, in accordance with such rules,
regulations and procedures as the Company shall prescribe and promulgate, to
and in the name of the coconut farmers who shall then incorporate as a private
entity under Act Numbered One Thousand Four Hundred Fifty-Nine, as amended * *
*." (Sec. 7, Republic Act 6260)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">and</p>

<blockquote>"The Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund and the Coconut
Industry Development Fund as well as all disbursements of said Funds for the
benefit of the coconut farmers * * shall not be construed or interpreted * * as
special and/or fiduciary funds, or as part of the general funds of the national
government within the contemplation of P.D. 711; nor as subsidy, donation, levy
government funded investment, or government share within the contemplation of
PD 898, <u>the intention being that said fund and the disbursements thereof as
herein authorized for the benefit of the coconut farmers shall be owned by them
in their private capacities</u> * * *." (Section 5, Article III, P.D.
1468)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The proposition is open to question, to say the least.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Solicitor General suggests quite
strongly that the laws operating or purporting to convert the coconut levy
funds into private funds, are a transgression of the basic limitations for the
licit exercise of the state's taxing and police powers, and that certain
provisions of said laws are merely clever <span class="SpellE">strategems</span>
to keep away government audit in order to facilitate misappropriation of the
funds in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The utilization and proper management of the coconut levy funds,
raised as they were by the State's police and taxing powers, are certainly the
concern of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
denied that it was the welfare of the entire nation that provided the prime
moving factor for the imposition of the levy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be denied that the coconut industry is one of the major
industries supporting the national economy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, the State's concern to make it a strong and secure
source not only of the livelihood of a significant segment of the population
but also of export earnings the sustained growth of which is one of the
imperatives of economic stability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
coconut levy funds are clearly affected with public interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Until it is demonstrated satisfactorily that
they have legitimately become private funds, they must <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
and by reason of the circumstances in which they were raised and accumulated be
accounted subject to the measures prescribed in E.O. Nos. 1, 2, and 14 to
prevent their concealment, dissipation, etc., which measures include the
sequestration and other orders of the PCGG complained of.</p>

the COCOFED elections, and the replacement of directors, being matters
incidental to the sequestration, should be addressed to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
