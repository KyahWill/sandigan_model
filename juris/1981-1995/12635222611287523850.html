This proceeding for <em>mandamus</em> against respondent Auditor General Ismael Mathay, Sr., the then Auditor General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  now retired, arose from the denial of a claim for back salaries of 
petitioner Romulo Sales, appointed Clerk II in the Bureau of Posts, 
previously designated Acting Postmaster of Pinamalayan, Oriental 
Mindoro, who was found short of P992.46 in his account on March 21, 1963
 and of P1,000.00 on May 24, 1963.  The amount in question covers the 
period from February 9, 1966 to August 15, 1971, during which time he 
was under suspension.  It was on the latter date that he received a 
resolution of the then Commissioner of Civil Service reducing what was 
originally the penalty of dismissal to six months suspension, finding 
petitioner guilty at most of gross neglect of duty.
<p>
The first letter of respondent Mathay, Sr., dated October 15, 1973, 
denying the claim, follows:  "In reply to your letter, dated March 6, 
1973, requesting payment of back salaries during the period that you 
were allegedly prevented to work as Postal Clerk II in the Pinamalayan 
Post Office, Oriental Mindoro, for the period from February 9, 1966 to 
August 15, 1971, please find enclosed a copy of the 4th Indorsement, 
dated September 18, 1973, of the Acting Undersecretary of Public Works, 
which is self-explanatory.  Accordingly, this Office is not inclined to 
allow payment of your salary corresponding to the period you were out of
 the service."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  The second 
letter from the same respondent reads thus:  "In connection with your 
letter of October 20, 1973 followed up by your letters of October 22 and
 31, 1973, we wish to inform that after considering the fact and 
circumstances of your case in conjunction with your arguments and the 
decisions of the Supreme Court you cited, we are of the opinion that 
your claim for back salaries from February 9, 1966 to August 15, 1971, 
may not be authorized for the reason that you have not shown that your 
suspension for the period covered by your claim is unjustified; that you
 have not rendered service for said period; and that you were not 
exonerated of the administrative charges against you.  Furthermore, the 
Commissioner of Civil Service in his decision of July 20, 1971, did not 
expressly order the payment of your back salary.  Indeed, in his latest 
decision (1st Indorsement, dated January 9, 1973, copy attached), the 
Commissioner of Civil Service denied your claim for payment of back 
salaries.  In view hereof, this Office finds no legal basis for allowing
 your claim, and, therefore, reiterates its decision embodied in a 
letter, dated October 15, 1973, to you."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  Hence this petition.
</p><p>
Respondents were required to comment.  Solicitor General Estelito P. 
Mendoza filed the Comment, later considered as the answer, as petition 
was given due course.  There was no dispute as to the above facts.  
After the filing of the memoranda by both parties, the case was deemed 
submitted for decision.
</p><p>
This petition for <em>mandamus</em> to review the actuation of respondent Mathay, Sr. lacks merit.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  On the above facts, the question posed is whether petitioner 
should be entitled to the payment of his back salary from February 9, 
1966 to August 15, 1971.  The answer must be in the negative.  That is 
to conform to the ruling in the case of Villamor v. Lacson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The pertinent excerpt, in the <em>ponencia </em>of
 Justice Paredes, follows: "It will be noted also that the modified 
decision did not exonerate the petitioners.  And if we take into account
 the fact that they did not work during the period for which they are 
now claiming salaries, there can be no legal or equitable basis to order
 the payment of their salaries.  The general proposition is that a 
public official is not entitled to any compensation if he has not 
rendered any service.  As you work, so shall you earned.  And even if we
 consider the punishment as suspension, before a public official or 
employee is entitled to payment of salaries withheld, it should be shown
 that the suspension was <em>unjustified </em>or <em>that the employee was innocent </em>of
 the charges proffered against him (F. B. Reyes vs. J. Hernandez, 71 
Phil., 397), which is not the case in the instant proceedings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 2.  The next paragraph of the above <em>ponencia </em>of Justice 
Paredes is equally conclusive on the matter of why the decision reached 
by respondent Mathay, Sr. cannot be reversed.  Thus: "The action at bar 
is one of <em>mandamus</em>.  For <em>mandamus</em> to lie, the legal 
right of the petitioner must be well defined, clear and certain, 
otherwise the petition for the issuance of such writ, will be denied 
(III Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 1963 Ed. 172).  Petitioners
 have not shown that they are entitled to the salaries, as a matter of 
right."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is dismissed for lack of merit.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, Aquino, Guerrero</em>, and <em>Abad Santos, JJ.</em>, concur.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., De Castro</em>, and <em>Escolin, JJ.,</em> did not take part.
