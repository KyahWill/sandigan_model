 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> rendered by the
then Court of First Instance of Iloilo, Branch II in Civil Case No. 11051
entitled, "Asuncion Arguelles, et al., Plaintiffs, versus <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Almarza</span>,
Defendant", petitioner came directly to this Court on a lone question of
law:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"May the possessor en <span class="SpellE"><u>concepto</u></span>
<u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>dueno</u></span> of a parcel of land, after the
lapse of more than ten years from the issuance of a Torrens Certificate of
Title to another person ask the latter to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the land?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was established that Lot No. 5815 of the <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>
Cadastre, situated in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Sulanga</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, originally belonged to
private respondents' predecessor-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Grana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
1929, he sold a portion thereof consisting of 7,300 square meters, more or
less, to petitioner and her husband, the late Leon <span class="SpellE">Almarza</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the sale, said portion was physically
segregated from the whole lot and was taken possession of by petitioner and her
husband, who since then had been in continuous, peaceful, open and adverse possession
thereof, cultivating and gathering the produce thereof and declaring the same
in their names for taxation purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The document evidencing the sale in favor of petitioner and her
husband was lost during the war, but sometime thereafter, the late Laura <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span>, mother of private respondents <st1:city><st1:place>Asuncion</st1:place></st1:city>
and Gilda Arguelles, executed an affidavit acknowledging the sale of said
portion to petitioner and her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of said affidavit and after actual inspection of the lot,
the Provincial Assessor issued a new tax declaration, Tax Declaration No. 456
beginning in the year 1945 to Leon <span class="SpellE">Almarza</span>,
annotating at the back thereof the aforementioned affidavit of the late Laura <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tax
declaration, covering the 7,300 sq. m. portion of Lot No. 5815 sold to
petitioner and her husband was designated as Lot No. 5815-B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, a new tax declaration, Tax
Declaration No. 3909 was issued by the Provincial Assessor in the name of <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> <span class="SpellE">Grana</span> for the remaining
portion of Lot No. 5815, described therein as Lot No. 5815-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime prior to July, 1950, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Malote</span>, mother of private respondents Gil and <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span>, filed for and
in behalf of her children and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">late
Laura <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span> </span>an answer in Cadastral Case No.
78, G.L.R.O. Record No. 1321.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support
of her claim over Lot No. 5815, she presented in evidence Tax Declaration No.
3909 covering only a portion thereof designated therein as Lot No. 5815-A and a
land tax receipt dated March 30, 1950 showing payment of the real estate tax
for a portion only of Lot No. 5815 known and described in the Tax Declaration
as Lot No. 5815-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1950" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1950</st1:date>,
the cadastral court declared Gil and <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span> owner of one-half undivided <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">share of Lot No. 5815 and the late Laura <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span> as owner of the other undivided half share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to a decree of title, Original
Certificate of Title No. 0-134, covering the entire </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lot</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> 5815 was issued in the name of said <span class="SpellE">adjudicatees</span> on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="29" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">May 29, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 1, 1951, Laura <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span>,
died, leaving private respondents Asuncion Arguelles and Gilda Arguelles as her
only children and legal successors-in-interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 20, 1977, private respondents Asuncion and Gilda
Arguelles and Gil and <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span>
instituted before the then Court of First Instance of Iloilo Civil Case No.
11051 against petitioner for recovery of the 7,300 sq. m. portion of Lot No.
5815 in her possession and for damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Basis of the action was OCT No. 0-134 issued on <st1:date year="1951" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, in turn, interposed a counterclaim for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of the disputed portion of Lot No. 5815 in her favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After trial, the lower
court rendered judgment on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June 2, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> in favor of private respondents, ordering
petitioner to vacate the portion of Lot No. 5815 subject of the controversy and
to deliver the same to private respondents, as </span>well as to pay the costs
of suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's counterclaim was
dismissed for the reason that although a constructive or implied trust was
constituted in favor of petitioner when the disputed portion was included in
the certificate of title issued to private respondents, petitioner's action for
<span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> had prescribed, more than ten years
having elapsed from the issuance of said certificate of title.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As between the
conclusion reached by the trial court that petitioner's action for
re-conveyance has prescribed and petitioner's own contention that it has not,
We find that the factual backdrop of the case at bar provides tenable reasons
for sustaining the latter's position.</p>

<p class="BODY">First.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed
that petitioner has been in possession as owner of the disputed portion of Lot
No. 5815 since 1929 by reason of a sale in her and her husband's favor by the
original owner thereof, <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> <span class="SpellE">Grana</span>,
predecessor-in-interest of private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said sale was even acknowledged by Laura <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span>,
mother of private respondents <st1:city><st1:place>Asuncion</st1:place></st1:city>
and Gilda Arguelles, in an affidavit annotated at the back of Tax Declaration
No. 456.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From that time on, petitioner
and/or her husband cultivated the land, gathered the produce thereof, declared
the same in her and/or her husband's name for taxation purposes and accordingly
paid the realty taxes due thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>CaragayLayno</u></span> <u>v</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,
133 SCRA 718, citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Sapto</u></span><u>,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al</u>
<u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Fabiana</u></span>, 103 Phil. 683 and <span class="SpellE"><u>Faja</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,
75 SCRA 441, cases with similar factual backgrounds as the instant case, We
held that prescription cannot be invoked in an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>,
which is, in effect, an action to quiet title against the plaintiff therein who
is in possession of the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The reason, We explained, is "that as lawful possessor and owner of
the Disputed Portion, her cause of action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
which, in effect, seeks to quiet title to property in one's possession is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
undisturbed possession over a period of fifty-two [52] years (48 years in this
case) gave her a continuing right to seek the aid of a Court of equity to
determine the nature of the adverse claim of a third party and the effect on
her title."</p>

<p class="BODY">We further stated that if ever prescription may be invoked, it
may be said to have commenced to run only from the time the possessor was made
aware of a claim adverse to his own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the case at bar, petitioner was made aware of such adverse claim only upon
service on her of the summons in Civil Case No. 11051.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As her action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>,
or to quiet title was contained in her counterclaim, the same cannot be said to
have already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
submitted by <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Malote</span>
during the Cadastral hearing consisted of tax declaration No. 3909 covering
only a portion of Lot No. 5815 designated as Lot No. 5815-A and land tax
receipt dated March 30, 1950 showing payment of real estate tax for a portion
only of Lot No. 5815, designated as Lot No. 5815-A in said tax declaration No.
3909.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In so doing, she laid claim only
to said portion of lot No. 5815 and did not assert ownership over the disputed
portion, known as Lot No. 5815-B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This being
the case, the inclusion of the disputed portion in OCT No. 0-134 is "void
and of no effect for a land registration court has no jurisdiction to decree a
lot to persons who have put no claim in it and who never asserted any right of
ownership over it."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>"The remedy of the landowner

<blockquote>"Apparently, the plaintiff [private respondents] are seeking
to recover the 7,300 square meters land in question because it is included in
their title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They have not rebutted the

dispute from its primitive owner, <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> <span class="SpellE">Grana</span>, in 1929 and the said sale was confirmed by the late
Laura <span class="SpellE">Pancrudo</span> after World War II.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs likewise have not disputed that

be "attaching full faith and credence to a Torrens certificate of
