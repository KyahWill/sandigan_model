<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1979, petitioners extended separate loans in the
amounts of US$2,520,000.00 and $850,000.00, respectively, to Maritime Company
Overseas, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(MCO, for brevity) a
Liberian corporation to finance its acquisition of the vessel MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To

MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>MCO defaulted on its aforesaid loans so much so that at the time of the
filing of this petition, it has an unpaid balance of US$802,832.78 exclusive of
interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1984, petitioners intervened in a court action in the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to protect their mortgage rights
over MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That case was filed by <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>

1985, Seven Brothers Shipping Corporation was the winning bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It changed the name MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>" to MV “Diamond Elephant".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioners challenged
the validity of the sale in </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petition
filed with the Court of Appeals in August 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two years later, the Court of Appeals rendered </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">decision annulling the sale and ordering the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Acting on this motion,
the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> court issued an order dated November 6,

 20, 1987</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Shipyard filed a motion to
lift preliminary attachment because it found it "unproductive and
expensive to be paying for the premium of the attachment bond." (p. 41, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Vol. I)</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="12">December 27,

writ of attachment executed in its favor for which the vessel MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>" was consequently attached." (pp. 41-42, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Vol. I)</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 5, 1988, the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> court
issued an order declaring that "the interests of substantial justice
transcend the technicalities of law, such as the notice of dismissal filed by
plaintiff herein", reiterating that MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>"
was still within "the jurisdiction of the Court," and directing the
sheriff of Manila or any of its deputies "to take all measures necessary
to put the vessel MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>" wherever found
under attachment and prevent the same vessel from being taken away from
Philippine waters." (p. 45, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Vol. I)</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span class="SpellE">Banque</span> Indosuez, apparently
prejudiced by the Manila Court's interference with the jurisdiction previously
acquired by the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> court over MV "<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span>" filed on December 22, 1987 with the Court of
Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for preliminary

<p class="BODY">On December 22, 1987, the Court of Appeals, in order to maintain
the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> resolved to issue a restraining order, restraining
respondent Judge and private respondents and all persons acting under or

issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and from further proceeding with
Civil Case No. 87-42758 (Manila Case).</p>

<p class="BODY">But when the sheriff of the Court of Appeals assisted by Coast

</span>They allege that a declaration that the present case has become moot and
