Ruby G. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> as Chief Nurse I of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Representative</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Pedro</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Trono</span></st1:placename>

in <span class="SpellE">Guimbal</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
as <span style="">approved by the Civil Service
Commission in </span>its <span style="">Resolution No.
89-321 dated </span><st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="5"><span style="">May 5, 1989</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
claims she has a preferential right to be appointed to the said position, which
she had held in an acting capacity for more </span>than a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stresses that she is next-<span style="">i</span>n-rank and not disqualified; <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>, on the other hand, is not eligible.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the challenged appointment, <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>
was no longer in the service, having retired as Senior Nurse of the said
hospital on <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1986</st1:date>,
subsequently collecting the gratuity, terminal leave and other benefits due
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was therefore being reinstated
under CSC <span style="">M</span>emorandum-Circular
No. 5, s-1983, which allows the reinstatement of a retiree only under certain
conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The required request <span style="">of </span>the Regional Health Office No. 6
for authority to reinstate her was denied by Civil Service Regional Office No.
6 (CSRO No. 6) on the ground that the vacancy <span style="">could </span>be filled by promotion of qualified personnel,
"attention being <span style="">invit</span>e<span style="">d </span>to the attached copy of the
letter-protest dated <span style="">September </span>15,
1988 of Ms. <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Teologo</span>,"
one of two other aspirants for the same position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This denial was appealed to the <span style="">Civil </span>Service Commission by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> J. Ortiz, Regional Health Director, who <span style="">justified </span>the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> on grounds of the <span style="">"exigency of the service" and </span>her superior
qualifications compared to those <span style="">of the
other </span>applicants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the assailed resolution, <span style="">the
CSC </span>set aside the denial of CSRO No. 6 and directed it "to take
appropriate action on the appointment of Mrs. Ruby G. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>,
subject to <span style="">Civil </span>Service Laws
and <span style="">Rules." </span>It <span style="">declared </span><u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><span style=""> that
â€œin the </span>case of Mrs. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gelvezon</span></span><span style="">, who </span>is
<span style="">neither a retiree </span>nor over-age
(57 or over), the head is not required to secure prior authority."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration insisting that
the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> was <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of law and the pertinent administrative regulations, particularly CSC
Memorandum Circular No. 5, s-1982.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CSRO
No. 6 also reminded the CSC that "grant of authority is a condition
precedent before Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> can be reinstated in
the service, considering that she retired <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> <span style="">as </span>may be duly supported" by her
application for retirement dated May 23, 1988 and its approval effective
October 26, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">These representations were denied by the CSC in its Resolution
No. 90-037, dated <st1:date year="1990" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1990</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which read:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>WHEREFORE, the foregoing
premises considered, the Commission resolved to deny, as it hereby denies, the
instant motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
earlier decision of this Commission as embodied in CSC Resolution No. 89-321
dated <st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1989</st1:date> is
therefore affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Mrs. Ruby
G. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>, the Chief of Hospital II of RPTMH and
the Regional Health Director of Region VI, Iloilo City are hereby admonished to
be more prudent and circumspect in making representations, otherwise, a
repetition of a similar act in the future will be dealt with administratively.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner then came to this Court, claiming that the
respondent CSC had committed grave abuse of discretion in sustaining the
reinstatement of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required to comment, the Solicitor General begins with an
assertion of his right and duty "to present to the Court the position that
will legally uphold the best interest of the Government although it may run
counter to <span style="">a </span>client's <span style="">position" </span>and his "specific
mandate to act and represent the Republic and/or the people before any court,
tribunal, body or commission in any matter, action or proceeding which, in his
opinion, affects the welfare of the people <span style="">as </span>the ends of justice may require." He then declares that
he cannot agree with the respondent CSC and proceeds to explain why he thinks
it is <span style="">in </span>error.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of <span class="SpellE">Orbos</span> v. Civil
Service Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
we sustained the authority invoked here by the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be fair, however, we<span style=""> </span>have made it clear that whenever he
disagrees with the office he is supposed to represent, <span style="">as </span>in the case at bar, we shall allow such office to file its own
comment in support of its position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
comment has been submitted by public respondent CSC.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the Solicitor General that the
above-mentioned resolutions of the CSC should be reversed as contrary to law
and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His view is that the
CSC cannot direct the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> as this
would be an encroachment <span style="">on </span>the
prerogative of another department, besides the <span style="">fact </span>that there is no justification for her appointment <span style="">in </span>view of her ineligibility and the
availability of other candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
notes especially her disqualification for the office for having misrepresented
that she had merely resigned (and so needed no special authority to return)
when the truth was that she had retired.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, as he maintains, that the CSC cannot usurp the
appointing power from the appropriate authority and substitute its choice with
another on the ground that the latter is better qualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discretion to determine this matter
belongs to the appointing authority and not respondent CSC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only function of the CSC in this regard
is to ascertain whether the appointee possesses the prescribed qualifications
and, if so, to attest to such fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only ground upon which the appointment may be <span style="">disallowed is that the appointee is not qualified, not that he is in
its opinion less qualified than others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span>p<span style="">resumption </span>is
<span style="">that the appointing authority is the
best judge of this matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said in
<span class="SpellE">Luego</span> v. Civil Service Commission:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Appointment<span style=""> </span>is an essentially
discretionary power and must be performed by the officer in which it is vested according
to his best lights, the only condition being that the appointee should possess
the qualifications required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
he does, then the appointment cannot be faulted on the ground that there are
others better qualified who should have been preferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a political question involving
considerations of wisdom which only the appointing authority can decide.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The CSC denies that it has usurped the appointing power of
another department and stresses that all it did was direct CSRO No. 6 to act on
the appointment made by the Health authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not making the appointment itself or ordering it to be made but
merely sustaining it under the applicable civil service rules and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding that <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>
possessed the prescribed qualifications and satisfied the requirements of CSC
Memorandum-Circular No. 5, s-1983, it had merely approved her reinstatement as
proposed by the Regional Health Director.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not clear from the records who has appointed <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> <span style="">as </span>Chief
Nurse I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>,
Jr., Director of the Hospital, merely recommended her reinstatement to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> M. Ortiz as Regional Health Director, who in turn
requested from CSRO No. 6 authority to reinstate her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reinstatement was presumably <span style="">to </span>be done by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law, it <span style="">is </span>the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or his <u>alter</u> <u><span style="">ego</span></u><span style="">, </span>the Secretary of Health, who can
make appointments of key personnel in the Department of Health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Yet,
in </span>the case at bar, Dr. Ortiz was <span style="">asking
</span><span style="">for </span>authority to
reinstate <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> as if he himself had the power to
do this.</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems to us that Dr. Ortiz's request should at the very least
have been coursed through or cleared by the Secretary of Health before being
submitted to CSRO No. 6 with his approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> would require a
new appointment and it <span style="">has </span>not
been shown that the Regional Health Director has the power to make such
appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of
regularity of official functions <span style="">is </span>not
applicable because the power in question clearly belongs not to Dr. Ortiz but
his superiors.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even assuming that the Regional Health Director was duly
empowered to make the appointment, there were still special conditions that had
to be fulfilled under<span style=""> </span><span style="">Memorandum-Circular No. 5, s-1983, which,
significantly, was promulgated </span>by <span style="">the
Civil Service Commission itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must
be remembered that we deal here not with the appointment of a newcomer to the
public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>
is a retiree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additional requirements
are prescribed for her appointment because it involves the reinstatement of a
person who, after having left the government, has a change of heart and wishes
to return.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General maintains that the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>, assuming it has been made by the appropriate
authority, nevertheless does not meet the three conditions mentioned in
Paragraph 2 of the memorandum-circular.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is the authorization to reinstate required in Paragraph 5
sustainable under the proven facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Like the assessment of the appointee's qualifications, the
determination of whether the appointment is demanded by the exigencies of the
service should be made by the appointing <span style="">authorities
</span>themselves, at least in the first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is they who can best understand the
needs and operations of their own <span style="">offices,
</span>their findings on this matter are entitled to great respect even from
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note, however, that in meeting the requirement of Paragraph
2(a), Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>, as <span style="">Director </span>of the RPTMH, merely said in his recommendation:<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. That the exigency of the service demands that the position
should be filled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Problems in the
Nursing Service have cropped up, wanting of the attendance of a nursing
administrator which may assume, unmanageable magnitude if left unsolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">This same recommendation was reiterated <u>verbatim</u> by Dr.
Ortiz in his own letter to CSRO No. 6 requesting authority to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Its tortuous construction aside, the above-quoted statement
actually says nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no more
than so many <span class="SpellE">cliches</span> stringed together to satisfy the
requirement, without any earnest effort to specify the problems facing the
Nursing Service and why they "may assume unmanageable magnitude if left
unsolved" because of the non-appointment of the <span class="SpellE">recommendee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "exigency of the service" is
not explained nor is it shown why it "demands" the filling of the
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The necessity for <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> sounds exaggerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The generalization seeks more to impress than
to inform and persuade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a meaningless
justification like this could suffice, the requirement might as well be
discarded altogether as a useless formality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding subsection (b), the respondents stress that in the
examination given by the Selection Placement and Promotion Board of the RPTMH, <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> placed first with a rating of 88.25%, followed by <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Balandra</span> with 87.5%
and <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Teologo</span> with
83.25%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was probably the main
reason for the conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> was the best
candidate among the three and for the following encomium from Dr. Ortiz (again
echoing Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> word for word):</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Mrs. Ruby G. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> brings along
with her the degree of competence, respectability and dedication to service,
qualities very desirable among people in the Civil Service, especially in the
Department of Health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These qualities
are found wanting in the other applicants.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not explained why applicants <span class="SpellE">Balandra</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teologo</span> are "wanting" in the qualities
of "competence, respectability and dedication to <span style="">service" </span>that seem to be the exclusive virtues of the
private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement is
itself wanting for not stating what other special qualifications <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> possessed, besides topping the examination, that
were not possessed by the other candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">qualifications </span>of
these aspirants were not discussed at all and were probably simply dismissed as
irrelevant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they are not, <span style="">of </span>course <span style="">for </span>the requirement is that the appointee must possess special
qualifications "not possessed" by the other candidates.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we see it, the recommendation is at best an unfair commentary
on <span class="SpellE">Balandra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teologo</span>, at
worst an undeserved disparagement of their credentials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are not so far behind those of <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>, especially in the case of <span class="SpellE">Balandra</span>,
<span style="">or even </span>of <span class="SpellE">Teologo</span>,
who had served <span style="">as </span>acting Chief
Nurse and holds the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> finished
only the Graduate Nurse course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The discretion given the appointing authority is subject to
stricter review where the person appointed is being returned to the government
after voluntarily retiring and collecting all the benefits appurtenant to such
retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The earlier approval of <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon's</span> retirement signifies that her services as Senior
Nurse were dispensable in 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly
she is needed again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must take more
than the usual explanation to justify her reinstatement now on the ground that
her services are after all indispensable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A retiree cannot just resume where he left off without the special
qualifications (not possessed by the other candidates) required in Paragraph
2(b).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> does have
these qualifications, her appointment is still not defensible under Paragraph
2(c) because there are other candidates for the office who are eligible and
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule expressly allows
reinstatement only "if the vacancy cannot be filled by promotion of
qualified officers or employees in the agency concerned." It is true that
the next-in-rank rule admits of exceptions, as we have ruled in many cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
But deviation from that rule requires special justification in the case at bar
because a retiree should ordinarily not be allowed to pre-empt incumbent
aspirants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The treatment of Paragraph 5 is still another matter that is not
easy to understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the
original findings of the respondent CSC, there was <span style="">a </span>need for authority to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>
because she had retired from the public service four years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the original erroneous finding
was her suppression of that material fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Confronted later with the record, she could not deny that she had indeed
not merely resigned but retired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CSC
then retracted its earlier statement and conceded that as a retiree <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> was directly covered by the
memorandum-circular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, by
some queer logic, it blandly declared in its Resolution No. 90-037:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Moreover,
the Commission, in said Resolution, directed CSRO No. 6 to act on the
appointment of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> for the reason that the
Commission found that said Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> merely
resigned from her position and thus, CSC MC No. 5, series of 1983 does not
apply to her case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this action of the
Commission, whatever defect there may be in the questioned appointment of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> to the contested position is thus validated or
rectified."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court feels that in giving such authority, the <span style="">CSC </span>was unduly <span class="SpellE">forebearing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if Paragraph 2 were disregarded, <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> would still not qualify for the position because
she had falsified her application and concealed the fact that she was a
retiree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is plain that she was less than
honest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the <span style="">CSC </span>itself later declared:</p>

<blockquote>A keen restudy of the case reveals that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>
actually filed an Application for Retirement under RA 1616 on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1986</st1:date> effective <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1986</st1:date>, as shown by the
said document and her signature in it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More importantly, in a letter dated July 12, 1988 to the Secretary of
the Department of Health (DOH), the Manager of the Government Service Insurance
System (GSIS), Iloilo Branch, Iloilo City, approved the said application for
retirement of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> effective October 26,
1986, which approval was docketed as Retirement Gratuity No.
ILO-RG-003331.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Hence, it can be said
that a misrepresentation or suppression of fact was made by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span>, the Chief of Hospital II of RPTMH and the
Regional Health Director as to the alleged </u><u><span style="">resignation of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span></span></u><span style=""> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis
supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">One wonders why, despite this finding, the CSC still approved <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon's</span> appointment, deciding simply to rap <span style="">her </span>on the wrist with <span style="">a </span>mere admonition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To <span style="">use
</span>the language of Rule 111, Section 23, of Civil Service Rules And
Personnel Actions and Policies, she "had intentionally made a false
statement of <span style="">a </span>material fact or
had practiced or attempted to practice <span style="">a
</span>deception or fraud in connection with her appointment." Yet the CSC
brushed aside this offense <span style="">as a </span>minor
infraction that deserved no sterner <span style="">action
than a mild reproof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Her reinstatement does <span style="">not
</span>square with the high standards the CSC has itself set for the members of
the Civil Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the constitutional
body charged with the<span style=""> </span>improvement
of the quality of the civil service, the CSC should have been the first to
question <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon's</span> appointment instead of heartily
endorsing it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, we note the Solicitor Generalâ€™s observations
that <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> was not really being reinstated as she
had never before held the position of Chief Nurse I, having retired only as
Senior Nurse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is correct, strictly
speaking, but the word "reinstatement" was <span style="">probably used in a generic sense to mean simply returning to the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the point is not really material
because the memorandum-circular speaks of "appointment, reinstatement or
retention" of </span>the <span style="">persons
covered by its provisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, in sum, that <span style="">as
a </span>retiree, <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> could <span style="">not be simply reinstated like any new
appointee but had to satisfy the stringent requirements laid down by CSC
Memorandum-</span>Circular<span style=""> </span>No. <span style="">5, </span><span style="">s-1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that
the appointing authority has wide discretion to determine the need to appoint
and to assess the qualifications of the person to be appointed, that discretion
may not be exercised <u>ex</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">gratia</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">but
â€œin conformity to the spirit of the law and in a manner to <span class="SpellE">subserve</span>
the ends of substantial justice."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> That discretion may be reviewed and reversed
in proper cases, especially where extraordinary care is required to attend its
exercise, as</span><span style=""> in </span><span style="">the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the fact that the Regional Health
Director does not appear to be the official authorized to appoint the private
respondent, we are not convinced that <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> </span>was
<span style="">the best choice under the particular
circumstances of this case, not the least important of which was the shunting
aside of the other candidates, who were eligible and available, besides being
incumbent in the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also feel
that while not the crucial consideration, the private respondent's
disqualification should have been taken into serious account in comparing the
over-all competence of the candidates instead of being dismissed as a light and
forgivable misdeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is really curious that <span class="SpellE">Gelvezon</span> was
accommodated in the disputed position despite the confluence of formidable
arguments against her reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
prejudicing the rights of the other qualified candidates, the grave abuse of
discretion clearly shown here should be corrected and reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Promotions in the Civil Service <span style="">should </span>always be made <span style="">on
</span>the basis of qualifications, including occupational competence, moral
character, devotion to duty, and, not least important, loyalty to the
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last trait should always be
given appropriate weight, to reward the civil servant who has chosen to make <span style="">his </span>employment in the Government <span style="">a </span>lifetime career in which he can
expect advancement through the years for work well done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Political patronage should not <span style="">be </span>necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His record alone should be sufficient
assurance that when <span style="">a </span>higher
position becomes vacant, he shall be seriously considered for the promotion
and, if warranted, preferred <span style="">to </span>less
devoted aspirants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <i>certiorari</i> is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CSC Resolution Nos. 89-321 and 90-037 are
