Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">*</span></span></a> dated August 28, 1986, affirming with modification,
the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XXXIII, convicting
petitioner for estafa, and from the resolution denying petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual antecedents are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in February, 1979, the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>in need of cash to defray
expenses in connection with his appealed labor case.  He sought assistance from his friend, Clemente Montuerto, and the
latter issued to him two (2) postdated pay-to-cash <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">checks, a PCIB Check in the amount of P3,000.00 and another, a
Philippine Trust Co. Check in the amount of P2,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On February 28, 1979,
Apolinario Mercado, another friend of the petitioner, brought and introduced
the petitioner and Montuerto to complainant Josephine Serrano at the latter's
office located at 504-A SMS Building, Juan Luna St., Manila.  Petitioner and Montuerto requested the
complainant and her husband to exchange with cash the two postdated checks which
they had in their possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At first, complainant and
her husband did not accede.  But Mercado
assured the complainant that the petitioner can afford to pay the money in
exchange of the postdated checks.  The
peti足tioner then went to assure the complainant that the checks will be funded
when encashed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Persuaded by the
representations and assurances of the peti足tioner, the complainant agreed to
cash the checks and handed the amount of P5,000.00 to the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Upon maturity of the
checks, they were deposited but were dishonored and returned to the
complainant, the reason being "Account Closed."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The complainant made
demands upon petitioner to make good the amount of the checks.  She also sent petitioner and Montuerto a
demand letter for petitioner and Montuerto to make good the amount </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the checks within five (5) days from the receipt of said letter.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In reply to the demand
letter of the complainant, the petitioner asked for a forty-five (45) days
grace period.  But despite the
expiration of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">45 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">days grace period, petitioner failed to make
good the value of the checks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">When the case </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">brought by complainant before the Fiscal's
Office, petitioner again promised to make good the amount of the checks, but
notwithstanding such promise, the checks in question were not redeemed.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Clemente Montuerto </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">were </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">charged with estafa, as defined in paragraph

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Accused Clemente

guilty of the </span>crime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">charged.  The dispositive portion of the decision

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In the resolution of
August 17, 1987, the Court gave due course to the petition and required the
parties to file their respective memoranda within twenty (20) days from notice
(Rollo, p. 100).  The memorandum for the
petitioner was filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">October 6, 1987 (Rollo, p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

PURELY CIVIL AND NOT CRIMINAL IN NATURE.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petition is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">devoid </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The main issue in this
case is whether or not the liability </span>of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> the petitioner is merely civil and not criminal in nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner contends
that under Article 315, 2(d) of the Revised </span>Penal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Code, estafa is committed by postdating a
check, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">issuing a check in payment of an obligation when
the offender had no </span>funds in the bank, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">or his </span>funds deposited therein were not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">sufficient </span>to cover the amount of the checks.  Since it was Clemente Montuerto who issued,
indorsed and guaranteed the two checks in question, he (petitioner), who had
nothing to do whatsoever with the said checks, cannot be convicted of estafa <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">charged in the information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is further argued by the petitioner that the postdated checks
were issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>securities for the money he received as a loan from the complainant and
his admission to the complainant's lawyer of his obligation to pay within a
period <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span>forty-five <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">days from receipt of his letter-reply
indicates </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">good faith and lack of criminal intent to
defraud the complaining witness.  For
having received the cash equivalent of the subject checks, his liability, if
any, is only civil </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was also stressed by the petitioner that in the absence of any
finding of conspiracy between him and Montuerto by the trial court and the
Court of Appeals, he cannot be convicted of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">crime </span>of estafa.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Solicitor General
countered that even if the checks in question were issued by Clemente
Montuerto, it was the petitioner who directly and personally used the checks
and presented them to the complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">In </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">negotiating directly and personally the
postdated checks issued by Montuerto and obtaining their cash value from the
com足plainant through deceit and fraudulent representations, both the trial and
appellate courts correctly interpreted the petitioner's act as the efficient
cause which constitutes the crime of estafa as defined and penalized under
paragraph 2(d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It cannot be denied that
when Montuerto issued the two postdated checks, he had no funds in the bank, or
his funds deposited therein were not sufficient to cover the amount of the
checks.  The fact that he went into
hiding after the incident is an evidence of guilt.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The contention of the
petitioner that he did not commit estafa because he did not issue or indorse
the postdated checks is devoid of merit.  While it is true that he did not issue or indorse the postdated checks,
his and Montuerto's concerted acts with common design and purpose in encashing
the questioned checks indicate the presence of conspiracy as charged in the information
filed against them.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">But </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, even
without discussing the existence of conspiracy, appellant cannot escape
liability by the fact alone that he did not ascertain whether or not Montuerto
had sufficient funds to cover the check (Decision, CA-G.R. No. 02173, p. 4),
citing People </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vs. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Isleta, 61 Phil. 332 [1935]).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It must be noted that
when the petitioner was in need of money, he asked the financial assistance of
his friend Montuerto, and the latter issued the two postdated checks.  Since the petitioner could not encash the
postdated checks at the banks, he and Montuerto went to another friend,
Apolinario Mercado.  Mercado brought and
introduced the petitioner and Montuerto to complainant Josephine Serrano at the
latter's office.  Petitioner </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Montuerto requested the complainant and her
husband to exchange with cash the two postdated checks which they had in their
possession.  At first, the Serranos
hesitated but with the assurance of Mercado and the petitioner to the
complainant that the checks will be funded when encashed, the latter exchanged
the two postdated checks with cash which she handed to the petitioner.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

13.0pt">has already been laid to rest by this Court in People v. Isleta and
Nuevo (61 Phil. 334 [1935]) where appellant without having issued or indorsed
the checks in question was held liable because of his guilty knowledg</span>e<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Both the trial court and
