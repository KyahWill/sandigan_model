				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Under the Labor Code, as amended, the requirements for the lawful
dismissal of an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">employee </span>by his
employer are two-fold:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the substantive
and the procedural.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only must the
dismissal be for a valid or authorized cause <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>provided by law [Arts. 279, 281, 282-284], but the
rudimentary requirements of due process -- notice and hearing -- must also be
observed before an employee may be dismissed [Art. 277(b).] One cannot go
without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>other, for otherwise
the termination would, in the eyes of the law, be illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of the instant case hinges on the determination of
whether or not petitioner had complied with the procedural requirements before
it dismissed private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents of this case, as summarized with particularity by
the Solicitor General, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent,
Fernando M. <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span>, had been an employee of the
petitioner corporation for almost ten years preceding his termination on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He started working for the petitioner on <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1973</st1:date> as Route Helper <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>the Company's Beer Marketing
Division, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Sales Office, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cotabato</span></span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>;
and since then, he was promoted twice before his elevation to his last position
of Route Salesman.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During his period of
employment, <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> had a clean record until at
around <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon
of <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1982</st1:date>, after
arriving from his day's work, he was approached at the Sales Office inside the
company's warehouse in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> by another company Route
Salesman named <span class="SpellE">Abdulkadil</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Then and there, in the
presence of the company warehousemen.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span> requested <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span>
if the latter could transfer to his account the 100 cases of empty regular beer
bottles and 100 cases of empty Beer Grande bottles worth P3,340.00, which were
returned allegedly for cash refund by <span class="SpellE">Dumamba's</span>
customer, but that <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span> did not have sufficient
sales/collections for the refund.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding nothing wrong
with <span class="SpellE">Dumamba's</span> proposition, as in fact, it was then a
common practice among salesmen whenever one of them did not have sufficient
sales/collection to pay for the value of beer empties returned for cash
refund.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span>
agreed to the proposition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> handed to <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span> the
P3<span class="GramE">,340.00</span> out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
</span>his sales/collections, and issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Dumamba's</span>
customer the corresponding cash refund invoice (Annex "B",
Petition).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> advised the warehouseman to reflect in his
Checker's Stock Report said returned beer empties.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It turned out, however,
that the beer empties were returned not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for
</span>cash refund, but to be credited to customer's account with the
petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For which, <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span>
issued to the customer </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">charge
refund invoice (Annex "A", Petition), but which was not recorded in
the latter's account ledger card because <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span> did
not include it in his sales report to make his transaction records appear </span>to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be in order.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, when <span class="GramE">a verification</span> was made on <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1982</st1:date>, of the account of <span class="SpellE">Dumamba's</span>
customer, the latter refused to sign the confirmation slip (Annex "C",
Petition) of his account with the petitioner company, claiming that the same
did not tally with his record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in</span>quiry was conducted
wherein it was found out that the discrepancy lies in <span class="SpellE">Dumamba's</span>
failure to include in his report the charge refund invoice he issued for the
return of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">said </span>beer empties, and
the misappropriation for his personal use [of] the cash intended for the refund
of the value thereof which was extended to him by <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span>
out of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">latter's
sales/collections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This,</span>
resulted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the recommendation for the grounding </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Dumamba</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> until further </span>investigation (Annex “D”, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Petition).</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, an
investigation was conducted sometime in March 1982 in connection with several
acts of defalcation allegedly committed by <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span>
during the year 1982, one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>which
was the misappropriation of the P3.340.00 covered by a cash refund invoice
issued by <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was for the purpose of
helping the Company in the investigation against <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span>,
particularly with respect to above-mentioned cash refund, as he was made to
understand by Regional Sales Manager Romeo A. Reyes who conducted the
investigation, that <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> gave his statement
(Annex "F", Petition) in the early morning of <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="3">March 4, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result of said
investigation, <span class="SpellE">Dumamba</span> was immediately grounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> on the
other hand was even recommended by the company's sales supervisor, <span class="SpellE">Ranulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabacho</span>, for promotion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>Salesman-in-Charge of the <span class="SpellE">Midsayap</span> (<st1:place>North <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place>)
Sales Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was likewise entrusted
to act as Salesman-in-Charge of the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Sales
Office whenever the regular salesman was absent.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, to <span class="SpellE">Almonicar's</span> shock and astonishment, he received on July 26,
1982, a letter dated July 21, 1982 from their Regional Manager, advising him
that, "after due investigation of your recent case, we have decided to
separate you from service at the close of business on August 15, 1982."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately, <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> sought an explanation from the Regional Manager
but the latter told him that the "decision" came from the company's
head office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, when the Regional Manager was asked
for copies of the alleged "investigation" and "decision",
the latter simply told him that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
pertinent papers will be forwarded to the Ministry of Labor.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>11.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prompted <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> to file on October 16, 1982 a complaint for
illegal dismissal with the Labor Ministry's Regional Office No. 12 in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City against the herein petitioner and Regional
Sales Manager Romeo A. Reyes.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>12.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After efforts of
conciliation with the Labor's Regional Office in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
City failed, the case was indorsed for compulsory arbitration to the Executive
Labor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Arbiter in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City, wherein the parties, through their
respective counsels, agreed at the hearing called on October 26, 1983 to submit
their case for decision on the bases of their position papers and supporting
evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>13.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto,
complainant <span class="SpellE">Almonicar</span> (herein private respondent)
duly filed his position paper and supporting documents on <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Anent the respondent (herein petitioner), its counsel filed a
Manifestation and Motion asking for an extension of twenty (20) days from Jan.
20, 1984 within which to file its position paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, another motion was filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">asking for a final extension of twenty (20)
days from February 10, 1984 within which to file its position paper, but the
petitioner failed to file even until Executive Labor Arbiter rendered his
decision (Annex "G", Petition) </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">May 30, 1984 finding private respondent's dismissal to be without basis
</span>and, therefore, entitled to full back wages with all fringe benefits
from the time of his termination up to the promulgation of the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, since private respondent's
reinstatement was no longer feasible, he was awarded a separation pay
corresponding to his ten (10) years of service at 1/2 month pay for every year
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">service based on his last
salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In </span>addition, petitioner
was ordered to pay private respondent's counsel 10% of the total award.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">14.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the foregoing decision, both parties
appealed to the respondent </span>Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In its appeal, petitioner alleged that the Executive Labor Arbiter
abused his discretion and erred in his findings of fact and conclusion of law
by introducing for the first time evidence in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">refutation of private respondent's position paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For his part, private respondent </span>assailed
the Executive Labor Arbiter's decision for not ordering his reinstatement,
despite the finding that his dismissal was without basis and no evidence
whatsoever was shown that this was no longer possible.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>15.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Commission,
which apparently overlooked private respondent's appeal and was misled into
appreciating petitioner's evidence presented for the first time on appeal,
promulgated on December 10, 1985 a decision (Annex "J", Petition), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">finding private respondent guilty of the
offense imputed to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
considering his ten (10) years of unblemished record with the company, he was
awarded a separation of 1/2 month's pay for every year of service, instead of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">reinstatement, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">without back wages.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">16.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So that, on a Motion for Reconsideration
(Annex "K", Petition) filed </span>by private respondent, the
respondent Commission rectified its errors by reversing and setting aside its
previous decision of December 10, 1985 and instead, promulgated on March 30,
1987 another decision (Annex "L", Petition) the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">WHEREFORE, premises considered the respondents are hereby ordered
to reinstate complainant to his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">former
position with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> with all of the benefits
legal and by contract and without </span>loss of seniority rights and other
privileges, computed from the date <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
his dismissal up to his </span>actual reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is directed to show proof of immediate
compliance to the </span>mandate of the decision after ten (10) days from
receipt of this Resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 121-128.]</p>

failed to file its position paper, forcing the arbiter to decide the case

Labor Code, which provides that the technical rules of evidence are not
controlling in proceedings before Labor Arbiters, allows the latter to decide
the case on the basis of position papers and other documents submitted by the

Neither is the Court deviating from the established rules that an employer
cannot be compelled to continue with the employment of workers guilty of acts
of misfeasance or malfeasance, and whose continuance in the service of the
employer is clearly inimical to his interests, and that the law, in protecting
the rights of workers, authorizes neither the oppression nor self-destruction
of employers [Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>,

emphasized nevertheless that due process must be observed in effecting an
employee's dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And
rightfully so, because the dismissal of an employee affects not only his
position but also his means of livelihood and his dependents’ sustenance.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The employee must be informed of the alleged

G.R. No. 77857, <st1:date year="1988" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1988</st1:date>]
stated:</p>

<blockquote>The twin requirements of notice and hearing constitute essential
elements of due process in cases of employee dismissal:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the requirement of notice is intended to
inform the employee concerned of the employer's intent to dismiss and the
reason for the proposed dismissal; upon the other hand, the requirement of
hearing affords the employee an opportunity to answer his employer's charges
against him and accordingly to defend himself <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
before dismissal is effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither of
these two requirements can be dispensed with without running afoul of the due
process requirement of the 1987 Constitution.</blockquote>
