<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution tended to establish the
following as the relevant facts:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The house of the victim <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> and his wife <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> is surrounded by coconut trees and banana plants and
stands near a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="8">3
 August 1985</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon, the victim and his wife <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span>
left their house to tap tuba from one of the nearby coconut trees situated 100
meters more or less from their house.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The victim's brother, Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span>, and <span style="">a </span>friend, Romeo Patricio, were at that
time in <span class="SpellE">Romulo's</span> house having been earlier fetched by
the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Gerardo, the children
of the victim, and Romeo (now deceased) were in the meantime left inside the
house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the particular coconut tree he had chosen, the
victim promptly climbed up while <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> was left <span style="">on </span>the ground looking up at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the top of the tree, the victim shouted to
<span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> to go home and prepare their supper.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> went back home and it was
while she was preparing their supper that she heard a gunshot followed by the
victim's cry for help.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
She immediately ran out towards the direction of the coconut tree <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> had climbed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gerardo, <span class="SpellE">Mercedita's</span> children <span style="">and </span>Romeo who had also heard the
gunshot, followed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> from <span style="">a </span>distance
of about five (5) arm-stretches, saw the appellant aiming his shotgun (locally
known <span style="">as </span>"<span class="SpellE">pugakhang</span>") at the victim who was still on top of the
coconut tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim attempted to
dodge the anticipated shots and moved his body from side to side, causing the
leaves of the coconut tree to sway.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">But, </span>appellant persisted and
fired again at the victim, this time <span style="">causing
</span>the latter to fall about twelve (12) feet to the ground.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span>, fearing for her own life, ran and hid
herself in the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she saw appellant and his co-accused
leave the scene of the crime, she emerged and approached her fallen husband.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Gerardo upon seeing his brother <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> fall from the coconut tree, turned to appellant and
demanded to know why the latter had shot <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant did not respond and instead pointed his gun menacingly at Gerardo and
said "You also."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, appellant and his companions hurriedly left the crime scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gerardo heard his brother groan and came to
the<span style=""> </span>latter's side to help him
but, a few minutes later, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gerardo proceeded to his parents' house in <span class="SpellE">Kinsay</span>-an to tell them the sad news.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) of the children of the victim went to the house of <span style="">Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Blacquio</span>,
Jr., a <span class="SpellE"><u>barangay</u></span> councilman of </span><span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span>, to report the death of their father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The children also went to see <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>, a <span class="SpellE"><u>barangay</u></span> captain, to ask him to look into the murder
of their father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Espino</span>,
without going to the scene of the crime and actually investigating the matter,
and relying upon information supplied by <span class="SpellE">Blacquio</span> who
had allegedly examined the cadaver of the victim, reported to the Desk Officer
of the Integrated National Police ("INPâ) of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>,
Patrolman Jesus Dominguez, that the victim, while on top of a coconut tree, had
been shot to death by unidentified men.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, Police Investigator <span class="SpellE">Junio</span>
Salazar examined the body of the victim and talked to Gerardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gerardo informed Salazar that it was
appellant Federico <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> who had shot his brother.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Gerardo did not, at that time, execute a sworn statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During a subsequent family conference,
however, it was decided that Gerardo should execute a sworn statement in order
to hasten the filing of criminal charges against appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="9">4 September 1985</st1:date>, Gerardo executed a sworn statement in
the <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span> Police Station, in which he once more
identified appellant as the gunman who had shot <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sonio</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Federico <span class="SpellE">Toribio's</span> version of
the facts was as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the day of the killing, appellant and his son <span class="SpellE">Reyson</span> were working as laborers at a fishpond managed by
one Federico <span class="SpellE">Gulac</span> in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Bay-<span class="SpellE">ang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, having gone thereon <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="7">29 July 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Batang</span> was about fifteen (15) kilometers from <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
first learned about <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio's</span>
death when he (appellant) returned to <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span> on <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="8">5 August 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also contends that the victim and his two (2) brothers,
<span class="SpellE">Polong</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span>, were widely known
in <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span> to be robbers and cattle rustlers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim's two (2) brothers, <span class="SpellE">Polong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>, had earlier
been killed by men believed to be members of the New People's Army
("NPA") and so, appellant argued, the victim <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> was probably killed by the <span class="SpellE">NPAs</span>,
too.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues to be resolved here are whether or not appellant's
guilt of the crime of murder had been shown beyond reasonable doubt, and
whether or not the qualifying circumstance of treachery had been properly
proved and appreciated.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> was firm and categorical in identifying appellant
Federico <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> as the man she had seen shoot and
kill her husband:</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Appellant's Brief, the defense suggested that prosecution witnesses
<span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> and Gerardo
<span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> <span style="">had </span>a
motive for chargi<span style="">n</span>g appellant
Federico <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> with the murder of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> -- revenge for Federico's having denounced to the
NPA <span class="SpellE">Romulo's</span> two (2) brothers as robbers and for the
death of those (2) brothers, presumably at the hands of the NPA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appears a new and intriguing suggestion,
but there is nothing in the record to support it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The implicit suggestion is that the testimony
of both <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> and Gerardo that Federico <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> had shot and killed <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> was a complete fabrication, designed to
"frame" an innocent man, and that <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
had in fact been killed by unknown persons.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The fishpond where the appellant and his
son <span class="SpellE">Reyson</span> were allegedly working on the day of the
killing of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span>
was, as noted earlier, about fifteen (15) kilometers away from the house of the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense alleged that this
fifteen (15) kilometers trip was commonly made (at least by appellant and his
son) partly by motorized tricycle from <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span> to <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span> and then by pump boat from <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Batang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Federico <span class="SpellE">Gulac</span>, the alleged manager of the
fishÂ­pond, testified that appellant and his son had gone from <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span> to the fishpond to work thereon 29 July 1985 (i.e.,
before the killing) and went back to <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span> on 5
August 1985 (i.e., after the killing), creating the impression (though <span class="SpellE">Gulac</span> never explicitly said so) that they had stayed there
all throughout the intervening days.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
There was no showing, however, that it was physically impossible for appellant
to have left <span class="SpellE">Batang</span> for <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span>
on the day of the killing, and then returned to <span class="SpellE">Batang</span>
on the same day.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Examination of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Gulac</span> reveals that he
was remarkably evasive and vague in his answers on cross-examination and as
well in his answers to the questions posed by the trial court, to the
exasperation of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gulac</span> claimed he had kept records showing <u>who</u> worked
<u>when</u> in the fishpond, but that he had surrendered the records to the
owners;<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
the defense, however, made no effort to subpoena those records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sum, his testimony was found inadequate by
the trial court, and we find no reason for departing from this finding of the
trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an attempt to discredit the testimony of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span>, the defense pointed to certain alleged
inconsistencies in Gerardo's statements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant claims that Gerardo had three (3) different versions as to why
he was in his brother's house at the time of the shooting of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gerardo,
appellant contends, had told Police Investigator Salazar that he was there at
that time because he and Romeo Patricio, a friend, had been invited by <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> to drink <u>tuba</u> with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second version, appellant claims, was
related by Gerardo to the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>,
i.e., that he and the other members of the family had been invited by his
brother <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> to his house to partake of newly
harvested rice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third version,
according to the appellant, was what Gerardo had recounted to the court during
the trial:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that Gerardo was there in the
victim's house to fetch their mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
note, however, that the matter of how and why Gerardo happened to be in the
house of the victim <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> was not a fact in issue in
the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any minor inconsistencies
that may have crept into Gerardo's testimony in respect of such matter did not,
consequently, affect his credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What had been definitely established by Gerardo and the other
prosecution witnesses was that Gerardo was in the victim's house at the time of
the shooting; and that he saw the appellant shoot Gerardo.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the alleged inconsistencies seem more apparent than real in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also suggested that <span class="SpellE">Mercedita's</span>
and Gerardo's testimony that appellant and his co-accused had tarried at the
scene of the crime instead of immediately leaving after having shot down <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span>, was inherently
incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not think so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the precise place of the
shooting was only about a hundred meters away from <span class="SpellE">Romulo's</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Mercedita's</span> house, a distance traversable in a
few minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's failure to quit
the scene of the crime immediately after having shot <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> is plausibly explainable by a desire on the
part of appellant to make sure that the victim was mortally wounded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also seeks to make capital of the fact that the police
report had stated that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> was killed by unidentified persons while <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> and Gerardo had pointed to appellant as the gunman
and killer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted earlier, the police
report was based upon information conveyed by <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Barangay</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>Captain <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espino</span> who had not personally investigated the
killing of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Espino</span> had simply relied upon information
conveyed by <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Barangay</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>Councilman <span class="SpellE">Blacquio</span>
that the victim had been killed by unidentified men.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Espino's</span> testimony is clearly an insufficient basis
for disregarding the clear and positive identification by <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span>
and Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> of appellant as the killer of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant argues that treachery was not present in the
instant case considering that the victim had become aware of the presence of
his attackers and had been able to shout for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is not persuaded by this
argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> was clearly not in a position to defend himself
at the time of the attack:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he was then
on top of a coconut tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His assailant
was on the ground aiming and firing at him much <span style="">as </span>if he w<span style="">ere </span>a
sitting duck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, in other words,
here the employment of means or methods or manner of execution which insured
the attacker's safety from any defensive or retaliatory act on the part of the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sonio</span> perched on top of the coconut tree was quite
helpless, and the trial court believed that such manner of execution was
deliberately or consciously chosen by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, we have no basis for rejecting this
finding of the trial court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>appellant
did not give <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> a chance to descend from the
coconut tree but rather shot him down from the tree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The location and position of the gunshot wound sustained by <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> clearly showed that the victim had been attacked
while perched on top of the coconut tree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The autopsy report of Dr. Rogelio G. Rivera stated that the point of
entrance of the bullets (or shotgun pellets) that had pierced the heart or lung
of the victim were in the "chest left anterior <span class="SpellE">axillary</span>
line level of nipple" and "chest left 6 ICS below nipple".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by the Solicitor General in
his Brief:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nipple is normally found at the level of
the <u>6th</u> <span class="SpellE">thoraxic</span> vertebra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the person firing the gun was at the level
of the victim, the bullets would not have lodged at the 1st and 2nd <span class="SpellE">thoraxic</span> vertebrae.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, the bullets were found lodged at the 1st and 2nd <span class="SpellE">thoraxic</span> vertebrae, while the points of entrance of the
bullets were either at the level of the nipple, or below the nipple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the trajectory of the bullets
could only have been upwards, leading to the necessary conclusion that the
victim was at a higher level than the gunman.<span style="">&nbsp;
