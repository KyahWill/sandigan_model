</span><span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> Marcos and his group who allegedly
entered the disputed fishponds through threat and intimidation on <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1981</st1:date> and threw the
petitioners out of the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants, now respondents, alleged their prior possession
of the fishponds and claimed that the petitioners were the ones who attempted
to dispossess them from the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, respondent <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="GramE">Arroyo,</span> intervened in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case alleging that he was the real owner of the fishponds and that the
defendants, now his co-respondents in this petition, were his lessees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts from the petitioners' viewpoint are recited
in their memorandum as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1. Prior to July 22, 1981, the fish­pond in dispute which consists
of four (4) parcels of land with an area of fifty-seven (57) hectares situated
in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Teracan</span>, Barrio
Consuelo, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, as depicted in LC Map-SZ-R-3-6-01 was inalienable
part of the public domain having been classified as mangrove swamp (<span class="SpellE">forestral</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibits H-3; K, K-1 to K-­4).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On July 22, 1981, the Minister of Natural Resources, then
Hon. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Q. Pena, issued BFD Administrative Order
No. 4-1596 (Exhibit H-3) which declared certain portions of the public domain
situated in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, Province of
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> under LC Project 21-A, as alienable and
disposable for fishpond development.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(Exhibit H</span>-3) Among those listed as

release from the public domain (<span class="SpellE">forestral</span>) of the
area in dispute as alienable and disposable for fishpond development by filing
an application <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit 1)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Vallarta
came upon a <u>swamp</u> area at <span class="SpellE">Teracan</span>, Bo. <span class="GramE">Consuelo, </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span class="GramE"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Macabebe</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE">, </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Province</span></st1:placetype><span class="GramE"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pampanga</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE">, occupied by his co-plaintiffs, who inherited their respective
areas from their grandparents.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Vallarta, on
his pro­posal, developed the subject area with his co-plaintiffs in 1976 and
little by little, thru the years, improved it into a developed fishpond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Presently fifty (50) hectares <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">are developed, while seven (7) hectares
remain undeveloped.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From plaintiff
Vallarta's verification from the Bureau of Lands, the land in question was
still public land (mangrove) swamp).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was referred to the Bureau of Forestry, which informed him that the area was
part of the public domain (<span class="SpellE">forestral</span>) and was
advised, as he was in occupancy thereof, to file an application for <span class="GramE">lease</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">agreement with
the Bureau of Fisheries, which in turn, told him that the area should first be
classified as alienable and dis­posable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A formal request <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was thus made by
Vallarta (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) which he filed with the Bureau of
Forestry.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application of
plaintiff Vallarta was referred to the Composite Land Classification Team (CLC
Team), the members of which are representatives of the Bureau of Lands, the
Bureau of Fisheries &amp; Aquatic Resources and the Bureau of Forest Develop­ment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The CLC Team classifies and <span class="SpellE">zonifies</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">area/s
fitted for fishpond purposes, as alienable and disposable, and effects survey
and prepares the map of the area involved.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CLC Team verified
from <span class="GramE">their own</span> records the nature of the area involved
and certified the same as public land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The questioned area is depicted in LC-Map-SZ­-R-36-01 (Exhibit A -
Injunction).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The CLC Team conducted the necessary field work on the area
applied for as alien­able and disposable for fishpond purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding the area in question suited for
fishpond purposes, the CLC Team issued the necessary certification that the
area is alienable and disposable for fishpond development subject to the
approval of the Minister of Natural Resources.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Minister of Natural Resources approved the recommendation of the
Director of Forestry and issued BFP ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 4-1596 dated July
22, 1981 which declares as 'alienable or disposable for fishpond development
that portion of the public domain situated in <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, containing an approximate area of 4,574.8
hectares, more or less, as shown and described in the Bureau of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Forest Development Map SZ-68.' (Exhibit H-3)
The 57.6373 hectare <span class="GramE">fishpond,</span> developed and occupied
by plaintiff Vallarta <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is a </span>portion
of the area covered by BFD Adm. Order No. 4-1596.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits K, K-1 to K-4, H-6, H-7)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the CLC Team headed by Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Banigued</span>,
who testified in the case, conducted in January 1981 an ocular inspection of
the area applied for, they found Roberto Vallarta in occupancy of the subject
area and saw workers and plaintiffs in the fishpond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also saw in the area in question
concrete dikes and gates, as well as milkfish, and indeed found it to be ‘fully
developed area.' The CLC Team prepared their Memorandum to the Chairman,
National LC Committee and Swamp <span class="SpellE">Zonification</span> Report
dated <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1981</st1:date>
recommending approval of the <span class="SpellE">zonification</span> of the area
into alienable and disposable for fishpond development.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits K, K-1 to K-4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1981</st1:date>, plaintiff Vallarta
filed his Application for Fishpond Lease Agreement (Exhibit J) with the Bureau
of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, covering the 57-hectares fishpond in
question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Vallarta and
his co­-plaintiffs had since 1976 continuously and peacefully developed and
operated subject fishpond until disturbance occurred on May to June 1981 and
complete interruption (forcible entry) occurred on <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1981</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since May 1981 up to
the time of forcible entry on <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="6">June 22,
 1981</st1:date>, defend­ants had been harassing plaintiffs with the assistance
of the military."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of the forcible entry case, the petitioners were
granted a temporary restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defendants-respondents were prohibited from harvesting the milkfish which were
in the fishponds when they took over possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after hearing the parties, the

the order was reversed and a writ of injunction, both mandatory and preventive,
was issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners were,
therefore, given back their possession of the disputed fishponds.</p>

elevation of that petition to this Court, we affirmed the findings and the
orders which restored possession to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, trial in the forcible entry case proceeded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judgment was rendered in favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Arroyo on a finding that the disputed fishponds
belonged to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original defendants
bowed out of the picture as the contract of lease allegedly executed between
them and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Arroyo had expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on the factual findings of the trial
court, the regional trial court and the respondent court affirmed the decision
on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government's land classification map states that the four
lots it covers, with an area of 57.6373, is a correct map of the areas
demarcated as Alienable or Disposable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It states that the areas were originally surveyed under Cad 378-D of the
<span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> Cadastre on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1966</st1:date> to May 31, 1966 and approved by the Director

<p class="BODY">As between the map prepared by a private surveyor for the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> and the map prepared for no less than four
different bureaus of the Ministry of Natural Resources as part of its land
classification program, this Court gives credit to the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lots in question <span class="GramE">are
not private property</span> as described by the respondent court but lands
still belonging to the public domain although now released to he developed as
fish­ponds by authorized lessees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In declaring respondent <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Arroyo as owner, the respondent court relied heavily on tax declarations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Going over these tax declarations, we find
them inadequate to sustain the court's findings. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The petitioners' contention appears to be
meritorious that the supposed 1921 declaration with superficially described
boundaries underwent meta­morphosis and extreme changes in areas and boundary
descriptions when it suddenly evolved in 1980 as three tax declarations
conveniently referring to cadastral Lots 3331, 3329, and 3305.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we see no need to discuss the
evolution of these tax declarations in detail in the light of the Government
declaration that these properties were released for alienation and disposition
only in 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners do not claim to own the disputed fishponds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They admit that when they entered on the
land, improved and developed it, and planted fish therein, it was still forest
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This explains why they filed
applications with the proper authorities for permits or licenses to develop
fishponds in the area.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim for damages due to respondents' seizure of the
fishponds for eight months is not fully established in these <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This case is without prejudice to the petitioners' taking separate legal
action to assert their claims for damages and rentals.</p>
