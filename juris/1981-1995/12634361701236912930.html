				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Department of Trade and Industry ("DTI") would want
us to set aside, in this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
dated 10 April 1990, of the Civil Service Commission ("CSC") which
reversed the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> of 07
March 1989 of the DTI Reorganization Appeals Board ("DTI-RAB") that,
in turn, affirmed the order of the DTI Reorganization Committee to do away with
the services of herein private respondent Taciana B. Espejo
("Espejo").</p>

<p class="BODY">Executive Order No. 133, entitled "Reorganizing the
Department of Trade and Industry, Its Attached Agencies and for Other
Purposes," was promulgated by the President of the Philippines on 27
February 1987, providing, among other things, that the National Cottage
Industry Development Authority ("NACIDA") was to be "reorganized
into the Cottage Industry Technology Center ("CITC") and attached to
the DTI." Pursuant to the above directive, DTI Memorandum Circular No. 28,
dated 24 April 1987, precleared with the CSC, was issued expressing the
guidelines for the evaluation and the placement of DTI personnel.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time, Espejo was a Division Chief II, Public Relations and
Management Staff Service, of NACIDA, and she was among those whose positions
and qualifications were evaluated and assessed.  The Reorganization Committee found Espejo not to <span style="">be </span>sufficiently qualified for retention.  Consequently, she was given a letter of
termination, dated 17 August 1988,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
although her actual separation from the service was later extended to 16
September 1988.  In the interim, or on
19 August 1988, she was offered the position of Industrial Development
Specialist, Operations Department, CITC, which was four (4) ranges lower than
her previous position.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> She
turned down the offer; instead, she appealed her case to the DTI-RAB.  Unable to obtain a reversal from the DTI-RAB
of the Reorganization Committee's findings, Espejo elevated the case to the
CSC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CSC, acting on Espejo's appeal, promulgated on 10 April 1990,
its assailed resolution, ordering the reinstatement of Espejo "to any
position comparable to her former position of Division Chief II in the new
positions in the <span style="">Department </span>of
Trade and Industry approved staffing pattern or the other agencies attached to
the Department of Trade and Industry." DTI's motion for <span style="">reconsideration </span>was denied by CSC on
17 July 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Manifestation, dated 9 August 1990, the DTI informed the
CSC that the position of Division Chief I RR-22 CITC, with a monthly salary of
P8,250.00, was offered to Espejo, but that the latter rejected it as not being
comparable to her old position of Division Chief II, RR-24.  In its Order<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,
dated 28 September 1990, the CSC held:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We clarify however that since the said position [Division
Chief II] which was range 18 prior to the salary standardization law is now
range 24.  It follows that what is
comparable to her former position is Division Chief of range 24."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on 5 February 1991, after resolving another request for
clarification and acting on Espejo's <span style="">plea,
</span>the CSC issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>,
thus:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, this Commission
resolved to direct the reinstatement of Taciana Espejo to the position of
either item No. 477 or 424 on the Bureau of Export Trade Promotion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition.  Petitioner DTI contends that it cannot be compelled by respondent CSC to
appoint respondent Taciana Espejo to any of the vacant positions of Division
Chief with Range 24 in the bureaus and offices of the Department of Trade and
Industry (including its attached agencies) since there are employees who are
more senior and better qualified than she.  DTI also points out that the functions to be discharged by the new
appointees would be different from, and would require expertise foreign to, her
old position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his Comment to the petition,
prefatorily states:</p>

<blockquote>"After a thorough study of the issues raised by the two
contending government agencies, this office gives merit to the cause of the CSC
and, in line with the Honorable Court's ruling <span style="">in </span>the case of Orbos etc,. vs. CSC (G.R. No. 92561, September
12, 1990), the OSG is submitting this Comment for and in behalf of public
respondent CSC."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's case, ably discoursed by its own counsel Aurora
Ma. F. Timbol, centers on the objectives of, and rationale behind, the
executive reorganization program and how, in general, the DTI, on its part, has
carefully devised procedures to put the plan into effect.  To be sure, appropriate guidelines have
indeed been set in place.  Regrettably,
however, even given all the sophisticated safeguards that can be provided
therefor, human factor would still be inevitable in the actual process of
implementation.  The President herself
(invested with authority to reorganize the Government under Sections 1 and 2,
Article III, of the Freedom Constitution, see also Section 16, Article XVIII,
of the 1987 Constitution), foreseeing, in her words, "(the) unnecessary
anxiety and demoralization among deserving officials and employees,
particularly in the career civil service," that the exercise of this power
might cause, has rightfully cautioned against its abuse and specifically warned
that "only those found corrupt, inefficient and undeserving (shall be)
separated from the government<span style=""> </span>service.‚Äù<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Whether the reorganization is to be adjudged valid, or invalid, inquiry must
perforce be made on the manner in which it is implemented and the way the power
is wielded by those to whom the authority is delegated.  Heretofore, this Court has repeatedly
expressed the need for extreme care and prudence in carrying out the
reorganization process.  Its
implementation, in any event, must pass the test of good faith.  In Dario v. Mison<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> we
laid down the rule, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Reorganization</u> <u>in</u> <u>this</u> <u>jurisdiction</u>
<u>have</u> <u>been</u> <u>regarded</u> <u>as</u> <u>valid</u> <u>provided</u> <u>they</u>
<u>are</u> <u>pursued</u> <u>in</u> <u>good</u> <u>faith.</u>  <u>As</u> <u>a</u> <u>general</u> <u>rule,</u>
<u>a</u> <u>reorganization</u> <u>is</u> <u>carried</u> <u>out</u> <u>in</u> <u>'good</u>
<u>faith'</u> <u>if</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>purpose</u>
<u>of</u> <u>economy</u> <u>or</u> <u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>bureaucracy</u> <u>more</u>
<u>efficient</u>.  In that event, no
dismissal (in case of dismissal) or separation actually occurs because the
position itself ceases to exist.  And in
that case, security of tenure would not be a Chinese wall.  Be that as it may, if the 'abolition,' which
is nothing else but a separation or removal, is done for political reasons or
purposely to defeat security of tenure, or otherwise not in good faith, no valid
'abolition' takes place and whatever 'abolition' is done, is void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u>.  There is an invalid 'abolition' as where
there is merely a change of nomenclature of positions, or where claims of
economy are belied by the existence of ample funds."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To this date, we have not deviated from
the above pronouncement, and we have struck down as invalid any attempt to
displace civil servants on a supposed call for efficiency or economy but which
in the end only fails to properly reflect and evince that explicit objective.  Republic Act No. 6656, "An Act to
Protect the Security Tenure of Civil Service Officers and Employee in the
Implementation of Government Reorganization," in part, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.  No officer or
employee in the career service shall be removed except for a valid cause and
after due notice and hearing.  A valid
cause for removal exists when pursuant to a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
reorganization, a position had been abolished or rendered redundant or there is
a <span style="">need </span>to merge, divide, or
consolidate positions in order to meet the exigencies of the service, or other
lawful causes allowed by the Civil Service Law.  The existence of any or some of the following circumstances may
be considered as<span style=""> </span>evidence of bad
faith in the removals made as a result of reorganization, giving rise to a
claim for reinstatement or reappointment by an aggrieved party:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(a)  Where there is a significant increase in the
number of positions in the new staffing pattern of the department or agency
concerned;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an office is abolished and another
performing substantially the same functions is created;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where incumbents are replaced by <span style="">less </span>qualified in terms of status of
appointment, performance and merit;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(d)  Where there is a reclassification of
officers in the department of agency concerned and the reclassified offices
perform substantially the same functions as the original offices;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(e)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the removal violates the order of
separation provided in Section 3 hereof."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In Mendoza v. Quisumbing,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> we
stressed that "(i)t is <span style="">a </span>paramount
principle in Public Officers' Law that the power to abolish public offices
vested in the legislature is not absolute, (and that it) <span style="">is </span><span style="">subject </span>to the limitations that it be exercised in good faith,
should never be for personal or political reasons, and cannot be implemented in
a manner contrary to law." It may be recalled that after 02 February 1987,
any reorganization undertaken by government is also circumscribed by the
provisions and safeguards of the new Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present controversy affecting the case of the private
respondent herein, no less than the Civil Service Commission itself has found
that the <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> rule has been ignored, thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Records show that under the DTI reorganization, there is a
significant increase in the number of positions in the new staffing
pattern.  In fact, one of its bureaus,
the Bureau of Foreign Trade increased its divisions from four to 15.  The DTI Undersecretary even admitted in a
public hearing in government reorganization that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Contrary to the general misconception of equating reorganization
with lay-off, DTI is increasing jobs to the extent that even if they absorb all
the NACIDA personnel, there would still be vacant positions.'</p>

<blockquote>Likewise, Section 18 (e) of E.O. No. 133 provides that NACIDA is
merely reorganized as CITC, and its functions other than technology development
and training, were transferred to the Bureau of Small and Medium Scale Business
Development (BSMBD) and relevant operating units of the Department (DTI).  Thus, the function of NACIDA are merely
transferred to other units of DTI, it follows that its personnel performing
particular functions shall also be transferred to the corresponding units.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We find particular merit on the evidence submitted by Espejo that
incumbents were replaced by those less qualified in terms of educational
qualification, performance and merit.  She submitted the cases of a personnel offices promoted to Division
Chief, an Analyst to Assistant Division Chief and appointments returned by this
Commission for lack of education/ experience/ training, while appellant, whose
qualifications include her being a Division Chief for 11 years and a Masteral
Degree, was offered a position four ranks lower.  The assailed decision even mentioned that Espejo, 'undoubtedly
possesses education and work experience to perhaps, merit retention in the
service.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>There was even no showing that Espejo was compared and assessed
along with others for purposes of her reappointment for a comparable position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With the increase in the new staffing pattern of DTI, the alleged
abolition of position of Espejo is not in good faith.  Further, considering the circumstances earlier stated, her
separation is found to be not in order."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Needless to state, our jurisdiction over
cases emanating from the CSC is limited to complaints of lack or excess of
jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack or excess of
jurisdiction that can justify <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.  Unless there is a grave abuse of that
discretion or when the findings are arbitrary and devoid of <span style="">evidentiary </span>justification, we must
accord due respect, if not finality, to those findings.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>
