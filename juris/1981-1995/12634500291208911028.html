<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>the stand
of the petitioner that the respondent <span style="">COMELEC
</span>acted with grave abuse <span style="">of </span>discretion
in holding that 6 election returns were written by one and the same person and
3 election returns were prepared by 2 different persons, because:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> During
the entire proceedings from the Navarro Board in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>
City to the <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> Board in the office of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in Manila to <span style="">the </span>oral arguments and hearing before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in Manila, no evidence at all
was presented concerning the handwriting experts of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
making such findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These findings
were made by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> only after the parties have
submitted their respective memoranda and the case <span class="GramE">has</span>
been deemed submitted for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the resolution was being prepared therefore, these findings by the
handwriting experts of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> were sought by the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to confirm their layman's finding that six
returns were prepared by one person and three returns were prepared by two
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PETITIONER HEREIN OR HER
UNDERSIGNED COUNSEL <span class="GramE">WERE</span> NEVER INFORMED NOR FURNISHED

alleged findings of <span style="">the </span>handwriting
experts of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This is a clear case of
disregard of constitutional due process" (p. 19, rec.).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE
</span><span style="">cannot sustain the stand of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE are convinced that the
respondent COMELEC acted within its authority in evaluating the handwritings found
on each of the forty contested election returns and in seeking the confirmation
of the handwriting experts in its conclusion that six (6) election returns were
written by one and the same person and three (3) returns were prepared by two
persons, indicating that the same are manufactured returns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Likewise, </span><span style="">WE are </span><span style="">not in accord with the argument </span>of the
petitioner that she was denied due process because she was not afforded the
opportunity "to refute the alleged findings of the handwriting experts of
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>." Such contention is without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the outset, it should be
recalled that at the hearing on <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="3">March
 11, 1980</st1:date> before the COMELEC, the parties dispensed with the
presentation of testimonial evidence, and merely prepared oral arguments and
submitted the case for decision after filing their respective memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner therefore waived further
presentation of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should also be
emphasized that the </span><span style="">findings of </span><span style="">the COMELEC
that six </span><span style="">(6) of the excluded </span><span style="">election returns </span><span style="">were written by one and the same person and
three (3) other returns were prepared by two </span><span style="">different </span><span style="">persons, indicating that said returns are manufactured, </span><span style="">were not </span><span style="">solely on the findings of the handwriting </span><span style="">experts </span><span style="">of the COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of
the handwriting experts <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the nine (9)
election returns merely </span><span style="">served </span><span style="">to confirm what the COMELEC has found after
it conducted "a close scrutiny of the disputed 40 election returns."
Thus, </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">stated by the respondent </span><span style="">COMELEC:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Although the foregoing conclusions pointing to certain traces
of irregularities in the election returns specified above could be as <span style="">they </span>are easily detected by any
layman's <span style="">eyes, </span>nevertheless the
Commission utilized its own <span style="">handwriting
</span>experts who confirmed the same findings thereon of the chairman and members
of the Commission" (p. 57, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear therefore from the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
findings of the respondent COMELEC that there was absolutely to <span style="">necessity on </span>the part of the
petitioner to refute <span style="">any </span>further
the findings of the handwriting experts as the COMELEC had already made a prior
conclusion <span style="">based </span>on evidence
independent of the findings of the handwriting experts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, any further proceedings touching on
the findings of the handwriting experts of the COMELEC would only serve to
delay the <span style="">disposition
</span><span style="">of </span>the case and would
not, in any way, <span style="">alter the findings of </span>the
Commission after it had closely scrutinized the contested election
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Thus, </span><span style="">in </span>the case of <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span> vs. Com­mission on
Elections (88 SCRA 251, 281), WE affirmed the authority of the COMELEC to
decide on contested election returns even without the aid of experts, using
only "common sense and <span style="">perception".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further argues that "the six (6) voting centers
whose returns were allegedly written by <span style="">one
a</span><span style="">nd </span>the same person are
geographically located <span style="">in </span><span style="">different </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">barangays</span></span><span style=""> </span>each between one to three kilometers
away from the other".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
stand of the petitioner that it was impossible for a man to prepare the
election returns in the six voting centers; she contends that "this <span style="">feat </span><span style="">is</span><span style=""> contrary to natural </span><span style="">law
and would </span><span style="">require superhuman
capacity.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But, as pointed out by
petitioner herself, </span><span style="">only </span><span style="">1 to 3 kilometers separated the six (6) </span><span style="">voting centers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Under
such a given situation, it would still be physically possible for a person to
go from one voting center to another and perform his assigned task with </span><span style="">ease, con­</span><span style="">sidering that in any election, means of transportation are always
readily made available by the candidates to their leaders and followers for any
political activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly pointed out
by the Solicitor General:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since motorized transporta­tion was
admittedly existing in the city of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>, the
distances mentioned <span style="">were </span><span style="">not insurmountable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for the amount of work involved in
preparing the returns, there is nothing in the record nor on the faces of the
returns to show that the individual responsible for it was under any definite
time constraints to carry out his task.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, judging from the tension obtaining - <span style="">as the records will bear out - before, during
and after the election in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City, which was
apparently generated by the intense rivalry between the two con­tending
political protagonists, this Court cannot close<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its eyes to the possibility that the election returns contested by
herein private respondent could have been prepared before election day, or even
</span><span style="">on </span><span style="">election day and </span><span style="">distributed among the different voting
centers with the connivance of the members of the Citizens Election Committee,
if they were not terrorized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner likewise assailed the respondent <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span>
order to exclude fourteen (14) other election returns which did not bear the
signatures or initials <span style="">of the members
of the Citizens Election Committees after the <span style="">entry </span>of votes for each candidate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner advanced the argument that under such circumstances, the
respondent COMELEC should have summoned the members of the committees<span style=""> </span>and directed them to supply the
omitted signatures or initials pursuant to Section 172 of the Election Code of
1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said Section 172 provides that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"If it should clearly appear that some requisites of form or data
had been omitted in the election returns, the board shall return them by the
most expeditious means, to the corresponding election committee for correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</p>

<p class="BODY">It is patent that Section 172 imposes such a duty on the board of
canvassers, not on the COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span style="">the law imposes a duty or confers a </span><span style="">power on the
COMELEC, </span><span style="">it expressly mentions
the COMELEC by name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Typical examples
are Sections 171, 173, 174 and 175.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover,
the correction </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the omission of the </span><span style="">signatures
or initials of </span><span style="">the members </span><span style="">of the citizens election committee </span><span style="">after the </span><span style="">entry of votes for the candidates, could not be among the </span><span style="">requisites inform </span><span style="">or data that could be corrected under Section
172; because Section 156 requires that the signatures of all the members of the
citizens election committee shall "be affixed in </span>full view of <span style="">the </span><span style="">public, </span><span style="">immediately </span><span style="">after </span><span style="">the</span> last vote <span style="">recorded,
or immediately af</span><span style="">ter </span><span style="">the name </span><span style="">of the candidate who did not receive any
vote" in </span><span style="">the voting center </span><span style="">itself soon after the counting of all the </span><span style="">votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Such
signatures shall close the entry of votes for each candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously therefore, the </span><span style="">correction of the </span><span style="">election returns by the election committee </span><span style="">pursuant to </span><span style="">Section 172 can only be made when the </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">election returns are returned </span><span style="">by the board </span><span style="">of canvassers to such election committee f</span><span style="">or such correction long after all </span><span style="">the votes have been </span><span style="">counted and long after the entry </span><span style="">of the votes counted for </span><span style="">each candidate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evidently, the </span><span style="">omission </span><span style="">of the signatures or initials of the </span><span style="">members of </span><span style="">the citizens election committees in the 14 election returns raises
serious doubts </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to the authenticity and </span><span style="">genuineness of </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">To
OUR mind, such omissions "stamp the election returns with the indelible
mark of falsity </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">irregularity, and,
conse­quently, of unreliability, </span><span style="">and justify their </span><span style="">exclusion from the </span><span style="">canvass"
(<span class="SpellE">Usman</span> vs. Commission on </span><span style="">Elections, 42 SCRA 686).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE are therefore of the considered view that
the respondent COMELEC </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">well </span><span style="">within its authority in excluding the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">returns </span><span style="">upon </span><span style="">its findings that the same "appear </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">have been tampered and/or manufactured."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

report (pp. 278-2</span><span style="">79, rec.) </span><span style="">submitted by Brigadier General Vicente E.
Eduardo, Regional Commander, PC/INP RECOM 3, to the PC</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Chief,
</span><span style="">Major
Gen. Fidel </span><span style="">V. Ramos, denying the
involvement of the constabulary in partisan politics in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cabanatuan</span></span><span style=""> City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, the
investigation report of Brig. Gen. </span><span style="">Vicente E. Eduardo relied upon by herein petitioner,
was </span>obviously tainted with bias, hence, unreliable, considering <span style="">that his son was a candidate in one of the
towns of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> and,
understandably, any adverse report from him relative to the conduct of election
in his area of respon­sibility would be prejudicial to, if not a black mark on,
his record and performance as PC/INP Regional Commander.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner likewise
assailed as error when the COMELEC accorded more weight to the affidavits of
witnesses adduced by private respondent Perez as against the affidavits and
sworn statements of the public school teachers who served as members of the
citizens election committees in the con­tested voting centers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This issue, as raised by herein petitioner,
was squarely met by the COMELEC when it noted that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">xxx.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"To contradict the affidavits presented on behalf of
petitioner the respondents have likewise adduced affidavits of the teachers who
were members of the Citizens Election Committees in the voting centers in
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was noted that most of
their affidavits are verbatim copies of one another, hence, of doubtful
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, as against the
sworn statements of petitioner's affiants constituting direct <span style="">and positive evidence, those of respondent's
were general denials and thus partake of the nature of negative evidence; and
as between positive and negative evidence, the well-established rule affords
greater weight and credence to the former (Francisco, The Revised Rules of
Court, Vol. VII, 1973 ed. pp. 4-5).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As pointed out, correctly, by peti­tioner, teachers <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> and Lydia Domingo
have categorically admitted they were forced to sign their affidavits (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. AA); and also, the members of the Citizens Election
Committees who executed affidavits contrary to those submitted by petitioner
were 'hostile and ill-motivated' for they have been charged by petitioner of
‘rampant violation of the election code and other election irregularities
before the Commission on Elections' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. U).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, it is difficult to believe that the numerous election
irregularities adversely affecting the genuineness and authenticity of the
questioned election returns could have been effected without the knowledge and
consent or collusion of the members of the Citizens Election Committees
concerned; and for which reason, the charges filed against them should be
investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that <span style="">respondent's argument sustained by the City
Board of Canvassers regarding the presumption that official duty was performed,
has been strongly</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and ade</span><span style="">quately <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by the totality of the facts and circumstances </span><span style="">borne </span><span style="">out by the

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">V</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE have <span class="SpellE">paintstakingly</span> examined the affidavits submitted by both
parties which are now part of the records in the case at bar and WE are
satisfied that the COMELEC was indeed justified in according more credence to
the affidavits of the witnesses of private respondent Perez over that of the
opposing affidavits of the members of the Citizens Election Committees concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
is </span><span style="">clear to US that the
affidavits submitted by respondent Perez are more consistent with the evidence
of fraud and other election irregularities found by the COMELEC on the face of
the election returns in controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
affidavits submitted by herein private respondent showed specific allegations
of terrorism, vote-buying, use of flying voters, non-counting of KBL votes in
favor of the KBL candidates, use of force and intimidation by the followers of
petitioner Garcia in the counting of ballots and in the preparation of the
election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the
affidavits and sworn statements of petitioner's witnesses were surprisingly
identical or similar </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">consisted mainly of general denials, hence,
cannot be accorded greater weight and credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, two members of the Citizens Election Committee, both </span><span style="">public school </span><span style="">teachers, subsequently revealed that they were coerced into signing the
affidavits for the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apart from the foregoing,
as deserving of </span><span style="">serious </span><span style="">consideration are the reports (which will be
quoted later) of Lt. Col. Francisco V. <span class="SpellE">Samala</span>, head
of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Special Action Team (COMSAT) in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">Major Rogelio S. De <span class="SpellE">Joya</span>, Station Commander INP, <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>
City, which confirmed the wholesale violations of the Election Code on
prohibited acts, such as terrorism, vote-buying and other election
irregularities by the men and followers of herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same reports also deplored the apparent
lack of cooperation on the part of the military to follow the directives of the
Special Action Team in the disposition of troops in critical areas in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City where armed men were reportedly
sighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reports likewise mentioned
the adamant refusal of the City Board of Canvassers, headed by <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Navarro, to stop the proclamation of candidate
Garcia in spite of the telegram sent by Chairman Leonardo B. Perez ordering
said board to suspend the proclamation (pp. 64-68, </span><span style="">r</span><span style="">ec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appropriate it is to say
at this juncture that, in the case at bar, the petitioner failed to show patent
and grave abuse by respondent COMELEC of its authority to exclude from the
canvass election returns which are, on their faces, obviously tampered with
and/or manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In upholding this
authority, WE have had the occasion to say that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The <u>broad power of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,

questions affecting elections '<u>for </u><u><span style="">the purpose of </span></u><u><span style="">insuring

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And as far back as <span class="SpellE">Cauton</span> vs. Commission on Elections (19 SCRA 911, 921-922),
this Court, speaking through the late Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,
stressed </span><span style="">that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purity of the elections <span style="">is one of the most fundamental requisites of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And lately, in <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span> vs. Commission on Elections, <u>supra</u>, this
Court finally stated that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>We might
disagree with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as to which voting center

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, in resolving the
main issue raised by the petitioner herein, the respondent COMELEC correctly
took into account the totality of the facts and circumstances obtaining before,
during and after the elections in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City,
all "pointing to the unworthiness for inclusion in the canvass of the
questioned election returns." The COMELEC cited the following noteworthy
events and circumstances:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As early as January 19, 1980, petitioner as Acting Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> expressed in writing his serious concern and

of respondent <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> A.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The remaining issue
raised by the petitioner relates to her allegations that if there were massive
vote-buying, flying voters, terrorism and other election irregularities during
the elections, these are not grounds for annulment of the election returns but
grounds for an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the early case
of <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> and

vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sanidad</span>, <u>supra</u>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, Section 175
of the Election Code of 1978, in no uncertain language, states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the COMELEC'S
broad power under the present Constitution has gained judicial
recognition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale is aptly
stated by Chief Justice Fernando in the recent case of Villegas vs. Commission

novel provision in the present constitution is that empowering </span>the
Commission on Elections to be 'the sole judge of all contests relating to the
elections, returns, and qualifications of all Members of the National Assembly
and elective provincial and city officials.’ Thus, its competence is greater
than that formerly found in the 1935 constitution which is limited to the
‘enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the conduct of
election.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its authority to decide pre-proclamation

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION CONCURRING IN THE RESULT</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, C<i>.J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The scholarly and comprehensive opinion for the Court by Justice
Makasiar represents a thorough inquiry into the factual and legal aspects of
the <span style="">two </span>petitions before
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the premises laid down, it does
not admit of doubt that it has full and ample support from the decisions relied
upon by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is for me
sufficient justification for viewing the matter in a different light, I concur
in the result for reasons to be set forth.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->As
noted in the dissenting and concurring opinion of Justice Teehankee, the ruling
in Laguda v. Commission on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
decided on February 20, 1981, where I was the <u>ponente</u>, could have been <span style="">decisive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For me, that should be the general rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would, to my mind, result in reducing the number of pre-proclamation
controversies and thus lessen the burden not only on the Commission on
Elections but even on this Court, when regrettably long after the election with
the victorious candidate proclaimed, the losing party would still insist on its
pre-proclamation aspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Laguda,
however, as noted by Justice Teehankee "apparently /has/ not taken
roots", an appraisal which I hope will no longer hold true in the near
future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, in the opinion of
the Court as well as </span><span style="">that of
Olfato v. </span><span style="">Com­mission on
Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> likewise penned by Justice Makasiar, this
Court under circumstances that impel such an approach, applied the principle
announced in Usman v. Commission on Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Cauton v.

then, these decisions have </span><span style="">not,
in </span><span style="">the language of Justice
Laurel "lost their virtuality."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Nor can it <span style="">be </span>said
that there is no juristic support for a diversity of result in cases which appa­rently
are not dissimilar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for me one of
the merits of the decision-making process if instead of a single rule at one
extreme and the exact opposite on the other, usually labeled an exception,
there is instead a continuum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
utility to serve the cause of justice is to me quite apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instea<span style="">d
</span>of mutually exclusive categories of black and white, there may be a
penumbra which, in the language of Justice Holmes "may shade from one
extreme to the other." That would allow for the individualization of
justice, depending on the peculiar environmental facts of each case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from Morris Cohen:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It would thus seem that life demands of
law two seemingly contradictory qualities, certainty or fixity and flexibility;
the former is needed that human enterprise be not paralyzed by doubt and
uncertainty, and the latter that it be not strangled by the hand of the dead

This is true especially of public law, where there is a need for a principle
broad enough to bring within its compass diverse and varied circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would go far in solving the eternal
conflict between rule and discretion, which dates back to Aristotle.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. That is from the conceptual standpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor <span style="">is
</span>the approach thus taken based solely of<span style=""> </span>what to me is dictated by <span style="">legal
</span>theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What had transpired since
the January 30 election yields support for the conclusion reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far <span style="">back
</span>as March 27, 1980, respondent Perez was proclaimed as winner by the City
Board of Canvassers in the electoral contest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He, therefore, assumed the functions of City Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continues to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has been discharging the duties for more
than a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To grant the petition in
G.R. No. 53793 would result in setting aside the proclamation of respon­dent
Perez so that petitioner Garcia could be proclaimed and thereafter hold such
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the lapse <span style="">of </span>time, it occurs to me that to allow
at this time such transfer of the position would hardly be in the public
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would be instability
once again in the situation, which as a result of a bitter electoral contest
has not been too peaceful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a choice
of what step to take, given the range of discretion possessed <span style="">by </span>this Court, it is my view that our
decision is not tainted by unfairness and is not oblivious to the realities of
the present state of affairs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence my concurrence in the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now up to respondent Commission to
assure a prompt determination of the matter with full and unimpeded opportunity
for both parties to prove their respective claims.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE DISSENTING AND CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent from the majority judgment in the first and main case
(G.R. No. 53793) dismissing the petition filed by petitioner Leonor A. Garcia to
set aside the questioned Comelec resolution whereby it summa­rily and with
grave abuse of discretion ordered the exclusion from the canvass and
nullification of forty election returns in the January 30, 1980 elections for
the mayoralty of Cabanatuan City (totalling 9,762 votes or representing about
20% of the total of some 53,530 votes cast and there<span style="">by </span>depriving Leonor of <span style="">her
</span>electoral victory margin of 2,356 votes and making Honorato C. Perez,
Sr. instead appear as the winner by some 1,000 votes) on the basis of mere
self-serving affidavits of said respondent Perez' partisan <span style="">and </span>paid KBL watchers, according more
credence thereto than <u>official</u> affidavits of <u>all</u> the public
school teachers comprising the Citizens Election Committees in the forty voting
centers in question, notwithstanding that said official affidavits were duly
buttressed by the presumption of regular performance of official duty and by
unimpeached official minutes of the voting and official investigations and
reports by the PC Chief of Constabulary and INP Director-General, Major General
Fidel V. Ramos, to President Ferdinand E. Marcos that Perez' and Assembly­man
Angel Concepcion's complaints against the PC/INP in the province of Nueva Ecija
were "false and exaggerated" and <span style="">"without </span>factual basis" and "intended merely as a
face-saving device . . . . in the <span style="">wake
of their </span>resounding defeat" and indicative of "an emerging
pattern of complaints by <span style="">losing </span>candidates
to blame their political defeats on the PC/INP rather than to admit their
rejection by the people."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
(On the basis of said official reports, "the President (had) clear(ed) Lt.
Col. Fontanilla and ordered return as Prov.’l<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">I concur with the judgment in the second case (G.R. No. 54277)
dismissing Perez' petition and sustaining the Comelec resolution of June 18,
1980 which set aside its previous dismissal of, and <span style="">reinstated </span>Leonor Garcia's cautionary election protest against
Perez and allowed the same to continue and to be properly determined on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be the grossest
injustice if after having deprived in summary proceedings Leonor Garcia of her
proclamation on <span style="">February 2, 1980 by </span>the
regularly constituted canvassing board and of her electoral victory, the
Comelec would yet deprive her of her basic and legal right to prosecute her
election protest, as the original midnight Comelec reso­lution of May 15, 1980<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>sought to do (with then retiring
Chairman Leonardo B. Perez of the then 5-member Commission abstaining).</p>

<p class="NUM">I. <u>Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first and
main case (G.R. 53793</u>) –</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be seen from the majority decision itself, on the basis of
the voting and canvass of the election returns Leonor emerged as the
indisputable winner of the mayoralty elections of Cabanatuan City over the then
incumbent Mayor Perez with a commanding margin of 2,356 votes out of 53,530
votes cast and was duly proclaimed as such by the city board of canvassers on
February 2, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">Perez progressively filed a series of petitions to nullify the
winning margin of Leonor:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, on
January 31, 1980 a petition for <u>recount</u> of the votes in 18 barangays
alleging <u>deficient</u> returns in that KBL votes for him were allegedly not
counted; then <span style="">he </span>filed <span style="">on February </span><span style="">1, 1980 </span>an amended petition for exclusion of the returns in 5
barangays and for <u>opening</u> of the ballot boxes and <u>recounting</u> the
votes, alleging that Leonor had resorted to "massive vote buying",
"terrorism", "flying voters", "non-counting of KBL
votes" and other election irregularities; and on February 5, 1980, he
filed still a <u>second</u> amended petition for exclusion of all returns from
9 barangays and a <u>recount</u> of the ballots alleging the commission of the
same irre­gularities as in his first amended petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Comelec lost no time in accomodating Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 1, 1980, it ordered suspension of
the canvass upon receipt of Perez's first petition (but the same was not
honored because of justified doubt as to its authenticity, since only a xerox
copy of the chairman's order of suspension was produced and not a <span style="">copy </span>duly issued by the telegraph
office) and it dispatched a special Comelec team headed by Lt. Col. Francisco
V. Samala "to exercise direct and immediate suspension and
control".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 6, 1980, the
Comelec further set aside the February 2, 1980 proclamation of Leonor, and
constituted a new board of canvassers replacing the original board and directed
that all election returns be brought to Manila for can­vassing at its offices
in Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the Comelec's instructions, the new canvassing board
headed by Edilberto Regalado commenced the recanvass in Manila and after
hearing the parties and receiving their documentary evidence, the Comelec's own
board <u>denied</u> Perez's petition for exclusion of the 40 contested election
returns (exclusion of which would wipe out 6,550 votes of Leonor as against
3,212 votes of Perez, and wipe out the <span style="">3,338
</span>vote margin of Leonor therein and leave her a net loser to Perez by some
1,000 votes in the <u>remaining</u> 176 voting centers whose <u>votes</u> alone
would be canvassed).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The canvassing
board correctly ruled, following the “polestar" doctrine of <u>Aratuc vs. </u><u><span style="">Comelec</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that "the question of whether or
not there had been any terrorism, vote-buying and other irreguralities in the
election should be ventilated in a <u>regular election protest</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and that <u>"extreme caution</u>" must be exercised and "only
upon the <u>most convincing proof</u>" may election returns be rejected as
"obviously manufactured or false".</p>

<p class="BODY">So for a second time, the Comelec's own canvassing board had
properly determined Leonor to be the undisputable winner of the election and
was set to proclaim her again on March 6, 1980 following the Comelec's own
policy resolution No. 9440 directing the proclamation of winning candidates
notwithstanding the pendency of pre-proclamation cases, when it was
nevertheless prevented by a contrary restraining order of the Comelec.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the oral argument of the parties but without
receiving any additional evidence (although it turned out later it uni­laterally
and ex-parte called in its handwriting experts without even informing the
prejudiced party Leonor thereof nor furnishing her with copy of their alleged
findings), the Comelec then issued its questioned Resolution of March 27, 1980
ordering the exclusion of the 40 returns in question and nullification of the
decisive and unbeatable winning margin of 3,338 votes obtained by Leonor in
said 40 voting centers and therewith the proclamation of Perez as the winner
with a margin of 1,111 votes, which was forthwith done by its canvassing board.</p>

<p class="BODY">This action of the Comelec was arbitrary and with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction and in violation of law and the
Court's controlling doctrinal jurisprudence and criteria.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. In overruling its own board of canvassers and ordering the
exclusion from the canvass of the 40 election returns on the basis of the
self-serving affidavits of the partisan and paid watchers of Perez of alleged
vote-buying and terrorism, etc., all stated in mere <u>general­ities</u>, the
Comelec preferred to believe the word of these paid parti­sans of Perez and
rejected the official affidavits of all the public school teachers comprising
the Citizens Election Committees of the 40 voting centers concerned denying and
belying their partisan charges and further disregarded the presumption of regular
performance of official duty by the teachers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, the Comelec repudiated and gave no credence to the official
findings of the investigation made by the P.C. Chief, Major General Fidel V.
Ramos (whose credibility rating can be taken note of as among, if not, the
highest in the military hierarchy) that the charges were and are
"false" and "without factual basis" and were but “a
face-saving device in the wake of /Perez’/ resounding defeat" at the
polls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And worst of all, the Comelec
likewise repudiated and gave no credence to the President's own evaluation and
approval of the PC Chief's official investigation report and findings -
contrary to the deference and credence due thereto.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The majority opinion rejects summarily PC Chief General Ramos'
official report, without citing any substantial evidence or hard facts, on the
bare speculative conclusion that "the investigation report of Brig. Gen.
Vicente E. Eduardo relied upon by herein petitioner, was obviously tainted with
bias, hence <span style="">unreliable, considering
that his son was a candidate in one of the towns of Nueva Ecija and,
understandably, any adverse report from him </span>relative to the conduct of
election in his area of responsibility would be prejudicial to, if not a black
mark on, his record and per­formance as PC/INP Regional Commander."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Such conclusion is to say the least unkind, reflecting as it does on the
integrity of the PC/INP Regional Commander as well as on the actions of the PC
Chief who verified and transmitted the official report and of the President who
approved the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What has been lost
sight of is that the affi­davits of Perez' paid and partisan watchers do not
give any specifics or details as to how many voters of Perez were driven away
from each voting center, how many flying voters were able to vote in each
voting center, and who were the armed men "terrorizing" at the
precincts and their number, so much so that even at this late date there have
been no charges, much less prosecutions that have been brought to our attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total unworthiness of these face-saving
affidavits is all the more brought home when it is considered that Perez was
the incumbent mayor and dominant KBL candidate with all the resources of the
city and party organization behind him as against his opponent newcomer Leonor
who was running under the banner of a newly organized small local party, the
Lapiang Pagkakaisa Ng Bayan.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">3. </span>The decisive
criterion of the law and the controlling doctrine of the Court's jurisprudence,
cited in the majority opinion but un­fortunately not applied herein, down to
the oft-cited leading case of <u>Aratuc vs. Comelec</u><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
is that "where it has been duly determined after investigation and
examination of the voting and registration records <span style="">that </span><u>actual</u> voting and election by the registered voters
had taken place in the questioned voting centers, the election returns <u>cannot</u>
be dis­regarded and excluded with the resulting <u>disenfranchisement</u> of
the voters, <span style="">but must be accorded prima

canvassing and proclamation purposes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the grievances relied upon is the commission of irregularities and
violation of the Election Law the <u>proper remedy</u> is <u>election protest</u>
(Anni vs. Isquierdo et al, L-35918, June 28, 1974)."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As further stressed therein, canvassing boards and the <span style="">Comelec </span>must exercise "<u>extreme

Here, the 40 election returns, per admission of the parties are <u>clean</u>
and do <u>not</u> contain erasures or superimpositions and the signatures
thereon of the Citizens Election Committee members are admittedly <u>genuine</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the therein cited precedent of <u>Anni vs. Izquierdo</u><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
"(T)he Court <u>set aside</u> the questioned Comelec resolution which
ordered the outright exclusion and rejection of the returns of 89 precincts
from 7 Sulu municipalities as 'manufactured returns' (because of <u>excess
votes</u>) and thereby excluded over 5,000 votes for petitioner notwith­standing
the admitted existence of <u>actual voting</u> therein and their having been
duly verified by the Comelec examination of the registration and voting records
to have been validly cast by the duly registered voters, which if not <u>arbitrarily
rejected</u>, were much more than sufficient to maintain petitioner's margin of
victory over respondent for the third and last provincial board member seat of
Sulu." In <u>Villalon</u><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

the Court likewise <u>set aside </u>the Comelec resolutions which excluded the
canvass of the returns in some decisive precincts (spelling the margin of
victory or defeat for the prota­gonists) on the ground of <u>excess votes</u>
since "We would not say there is <u>'most convincing proof</u>' of excess
votes which would authorize the conclusion that the pertinent return is
'obviously manufactured,' 'utterly improbable and clearly incredible' and
should be disregarded in the canvass, thereby resulting in the <u>elimination</u>
from the count of the <u>honest votes</u> cast therein," stating further
that "the function of <u>separating the honest (votes) from the dishonest
ones</u> . . . . belongs exclusively to the electoral tribunals or to the
courts in respect to local elections" in the corresponding <u>election
protest</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the oft-cited case of <u>Bashier vs. Comelec</u><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court once again stressed that where "there was <u>actual voting</u>,
in the absence of strong evidence establishing the spuriousness of the returns,
the <u>basic rule</u> of their being accorded <u>prima facie</u> status as <u>bona

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court took the occasion to explain
therein that in the said cases involving the election of delegates to the 1971

(involving the <span style="">1970 </span><u>Lanao del

Convention delegates), <span style="">it had </span>allowed
evidence <u>aliunde</u> and the Comelec's examination of the <span style="">voting </span>records to determine and verify

handful of persons" . . . "in /these/ <u>critical areas</u> where <u>fabricated
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>spurious returns</u> have been the <u>rule

uncalled for when there is no question that there has been <u>actual voting</u>
and regular returns duly prepared and submitted at the end of the voting by the
election inspectors (now C.E.C. members), as in the <span style="">present case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4. The case of Leonor is much stronger than in any of the
above-cited cases. -</p>

<p class="BODY">- There is no question that <u>actual voting</u> had been
conducted on election day at the hours set by law;</p>

<p class="BODY">- Cabanatuan City is right in the heart of Central Luzon with the
election properly supervised by the Comelec as well as by the police and
constabulary authorities with ready access to the public media, whereby
irregularities and terrorism could be immediately reported and malefactors
apprehended <u>in</u> <u>flagrante delicto</u>;</p>

<p class="BODY">- Cabanatuan City has never been stained with the reputation of
the critical areas in the North or South "where fabricated and spurious
returns have been the rule rather than the exception";</p>

<p class="BODY">- There is not even any question here of any excess votes recorded
over the number of registered voters nor of the notorious fraud hallmarks of
practically blanking the opponent with zero votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonor bested Perez in these precincts by a
margin of 2 to 1, even in Perez' own baili­<span style="">wicks; </span>and</p>

<p class="BODY">- The self-serving charges of alleged terrorism made by the
official candidate of the predominant KBL against his lady opponent were imme­diately
investigated and found to be "false" and "without factual

provincial commander.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Prescinding from the foregoing controlling jurisprudence and
criteria that call for the setting aside of the Comelec's ar­bitrary and
summary exclusion and nullification of the 40 returns in question, a brief rundown
of the specifics will readily show the lack of factual and evidentiary basis
for the Comelec's action:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) Comelec excluded 6 returns on its own evaluation and
conclusion supposedly confirmed by its handwriting experts that they were
written by one and the same person "indicating that the same are
manufactured returns."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
This was denial of due process, as correctly averred by Leonor since no
evidence at all was presented during the entire proceedings before the
canvassing board in Cabanatuan City nor before the Comelec in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such alleged opinion and findings of the
handwriting experts were unilaterally and <u>motu</u> <u><span style="">proprio</span></u><span style=""> </span>sought by Comelec ex-parte and <u><span style="">only after</span></u><span style=""> </span>the
submittal of the case on the basis of the documentary evidence duly submitted
by the parties and were revealed <u><span style="">for
the first time</span></u><span style=""> </span>only
in the questioned <span style="">Comelec resolution
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonor was never even informed
of such alleged findings nor afforded the opportunity to refute the alleged
findings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Leonor's submittal that
such a feat was a physical superhuman impossibility because the precincts were
located at least 1 to 3 kilometers from each other and for one person to have
filled up the said returns (writing the names of a total of </span><u>40
candidates</u><span style=""> for governor, vice
governor and the </span><u>Sangguniang Panglalawigan</u> <span style="">and for mayor, vice mayor and the </span><u>Sangguniang
Panglungsod</u>, <span style="">the respective votes
for each candidate as tallied as well as for the plebiscite on the extension of
tenure of members of the judiciary, sum up the total in words and figures therefor
and sign the names of three public school teachers for each of the returns)
would have required "superhuman capacity and speed" since by midnight
of election day, all returns had already been submitted </span>to <span style="">the city election registrar in the heart of
the city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion's rejection of Leonor's plaint of denial of
due process on the ground that "the parties dispensed with the pre­sentation
of testimonial evidence . . . . and (she) therefore waived further presentation
of evidence" begs the question and in no way <span style="">jus­tifies </span>Comelec's resort to evidence <u>aliunde</u> (after
submittal of the case) by way of the alleged findings of its handwriting
experts without according Leonor due process by informing her thereof and
giving her the opportunity to refute the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion's speculation in response to Leonor's con­tention
of physical impossibility of <span style="">one </span>person
writing all the returns within the time involved based on "common sense
and perception" that "this Court cannot close its eyes to the
possibility that the election returns contested by herein private respondent
could have been pre­pared before election day, or even on election day and
distributed among the different voting centers with the connivance of the
members of the Citizens Election Committee, if they were not terrorized"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
certainly cannot be substituted for the lack of hard and substantial evidence
to support Comelec's arbitrary conclusion or its speculation, specially since
not even Perez has even questioned that <u>actual voting</u><span style=""> </span>took place in all the precincts, and
that the returns were thereafter submitted in due course to the canvassing
board.</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) Comelec excluded 17 other returns (3 because "entries
(were) written by two different persons, and 14 because there were "no
signatures/initials of all the members after the entry of votes <span style="">for each candidate."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">) As to the 3 returns where entries were
written by 2 different persons, this cannot nullify the returns be­cause it is
commonplace in elections that such entries be made by two of the three public
school teachers - CEC members, and Comelec made no finding, as it could not
because these were not questioned at all on this ground, that the entries were <u>not</u>
made by the teachers - CEC members, and instead capriciously nullified the
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As to the other 14 other
returns where the entries are not closed with the teachers' signatures or
initials, there is no legal basis whatever <span style="">to </span>justify Comelec's action because Section 172 of the 1978
Election Code precisely mandates that where "some requisites as to form or
data had been omitted in the election returns, the /canvassing/ board shall <u><span style="">return</span></u><span style=""> </span>then by the most expeditious means to the corres­ponding <u><span style="">election committees</span></u><span style=""> </span>for <u><span style="">correction</span></u><span style="">." </span>Such
omissions which do not affect at all the integrity of the returns cannot bring
about the dis­enfranchisement of the innocent voters therein to the prejudice
of their valid choice and nullify their votes, as Comelec has arbitrarily
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be regretfully stated that
the majority opinion's ratiocination that "Section 172 imposes such a duty
on the <u><span style="">board</span></u><span style=""> </span>of canvassers, <u>not </u><u><span style="">on the Comelec</span></u><span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
cannot stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Comelec may very well
direct the board to comply with the mandate of Sec. 172 and send back the
returns to the election committees to do the ministerial job of closing the
entries with their initials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
really, as stressed in <u><span style="">Aratuc</span></u><span style=""> </span>"it is of decisive importance to
bear in mind that under Section 168 of the Revised Election Code of 1978 the
/Comelec/ shall have <u><span style="">direct control </span>and
</u><u><span style="">supervision</span></u><span style=""> </span>over the board of canvassers and that
“/as/ a superior body or office having supervision and control over another
/the canvassing board/, /Comelec/ may do directly what the latter is supposed
to do or ought to have done."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
As Comelec had taken over from the second canvassing board it itself had
constituted in re­placement of the original board and stopped it from
proclaiming Leonor, it became its duty to apply the corrective provisions of
the law under Section 172, not to nullify the returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, to say that "the omission of the signatures or
initials" which happens many times because of ignorance of the rules,
haste, over <span style="">sight </span>or the
lateness of the hour, "stamps the election returns with the indelible mark
of falsity and irregularity" using the language of <u>Usman</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
equating that case with the case at bar is unfair and unkind, to say the
least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of <u><span style="">Usman</span></u><span style=""> </span>will readily show that there is no comparison:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u><span style="">Usman</span></u><span style=""> </span>Comelec conducted an examination and
analysis of the voters' fingerprints and signatures "more than sufficed to
com­pletely overcome the <u><span style="">prima facie</span></u>
value of the 42 election returns from Karomatan, strongly belying their
integrity and authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
circumstances definitely point, not merely to a few isolated instances of
irregularities affecting the integrity and authenticity <span style="">of </span>the elec­tion returns, but to an organized, well-directed
large-scale operation to make a mockery of the elections in Karomatan."
This was further buttressed "by the very high percentage of voting in the
42 precincts of Karomatan - with 100% voting in 10 precincts and with more than
100% voting in 10 precincts" and "the notorious election record of
Karomatan in previous elections since 1953 indicating a phenomenal increase in
the voting population."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
No such thing could be said of the election in Cabanatuan C<span style="">ity, </span>where admittedly there was
regular and actual voting, as certified by the teachers - C.E.C. members them­selves
and the official report of the PC Chief duly approved by the President himself.</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) Comelec excluded and nullified the remaining 20 other returns
(for a total of 40 returns) cavalierly on general "grounds that certain
election returns were prepared thru criminal collusion of members of the C.E.C.
thru the intervention and/or dictation of armed men of candidate Garcia"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>without</u> any specification of which of said re­turns were prepared <u>voluntarily</u>
thru criminal collusion and which were prepared <u>forcibly</u> at the
dictation of armed men, and <u>who</u> were the public school teachers - C.E.C.
members who <u>committed</u> the <u>criminal collusion</u> and <u>who</u> were
the <u>victims</u> of the armed men, <u>none</u> of whom were likewise
identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such generalities based on
self-serving affidavits of Perez' henchmen certainly do not come up to the
standard of the <u>clearest</u> and <u>most convincing evidence</u> that would
justify the nullifi­cation of the returns and the disenfranchisement of the
innocent voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up to this late date,
there have not been any results of the investiga­tion of Perez' charges as
ordered by the Comelec in its resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">At bottom, as indicated at the onset, the self-serving affidavits
of Perez' paid partisan watchers fall far short of constituting "the most
convincing proof" that would warrant rejection of the returns in the face
of the official affidavits of the public school teachers - CEC members
attesting to the regularity of the election processes and but­<span style="">tressed </span>by the presumption of regular
performance of official duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
downgrading of the teachers' affidavits as "surprisingly identical or
similar and consist(ing) mainly of general denials, hence, cannot be accorded
greater weight and credence" despite their execution by public officials
in the performance of official duty must not be allowed <span style="">to stand, since the fact that affidavits by a party "are of one
style or wording is nothing unusual, since in actual practice, the words of an
affidavit are not necessarily those of the affiant and when the same matter is
to be attested to, almost invariably, the affidavits of several persons appear
to be identical </span><u>mutatis mutandis</u>, <span style="">without minimizing in any significant degree their intrinsic worth for
the purpose for which they have been prepared."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The majority opinion's

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Much less can said

reproduced in the majority opinion</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> are the best evidence of the correctness and

<p class="NUM">6. Perez' proper recourse is an <u><span style="">election protest</span></u><span style="">, </span>as
held by the Court <span style="">in </span>the recent
case of <u><span style="">Laguda vs. Comelec</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>penned by the Chief Justice for a <u><span style="">unanimous</span></u><span style=""> </span>Court, (which however has apparently not <span style="">taken roots yet despite the host of other
precedents.) The case's background is identical to that at bar, with Laguda who
failed in his attempt at reelection as municipal mayor seeking the suspension
of the canvass on the ground of "alleged electoral frauds or irregu­larities
. . . the alleged threats and presence of subversive and terrorist
elements." But the Comelec correctly ruled therein (as it likewise rule in
<u>Sampaco</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <u>Villegas</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and <u>Leviste</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and many other cases) - unlike in the case
at bar - that the grounds are <u>"proper grounds</u> for an appropriate <u>election
contest</u> wherein /the loser/ may ventilate his grievances." In
sustaining the Comelec, the Court held that "an inquiry on the grounds . .
. would necessarily entail the <u>pre­sentation</u> of <u>conflicting testimony</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pass on such a <u>complex matter</u> in a</span>
<u>s</u><u><span style="">ummary</span></u><span style=""> proceeding would be to run the risk that the
<u>decision </u>arrived at <u>would not reflect the realities of the situation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could even be susceptible to the charge
that the <u>whole truth did not come to light</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, an <u>election
protest</u> <u>clearly</u> is the <u>more</u> <u>appropriate remedy</u>."
The case at bar is the most eloquent proof of the validity of the said
pronouncements of this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">7. In discussing Leonor's petition questioning the Comelec action
of excluding the 40 questioned returns and thus depriving her <span style="">of her commanding margin of victory </span>(as
<span style="">determined twice by the original
canvassing board as well as the second board constituted by Comelc itself) the
majority </span><span style="">opinion </span><span style="">ruled that "the petitioner (Leonor)
failed to </span>show <span style="">patent and grave
abuse by respondent COMELEC of its authority to exclude from the canvass
election returns which are, on <u>their faces</u>, obviously tampered with
and/or manufactured.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Herein lies the <u>fatal premise</u> and <u>lack
of factual and legal basis</u> for the questioned Comelec action - as shown
extensively hereinabove, in <u>no way</u> do said returns show that they are
"<u>on their faces, obviously tampered with</u> </span>and/or <u>manufactured</u>."
Perez asked for a useless recount but Comelec erased Leonor's decisive
3.338-vote margin <span style="">by excluding the 40
precincts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the Comelec action must be set aside as “capri­cious,
arbitrary and whimsical exercise of power, the very antithesis of the judicial
prerogative in accordance with centuries of both civil law and common law
tradition."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The broad powers given to Comelec under the 1973 Constitution
merely incorporates the liberality with which the Court has always treated the
Comelec's performance of its duty to guard against the use and inclusion of
false, tampered or manufactured returns as per the cases of <u>Usman</u> and <u>Aratuc</u>
cited in the majority opinion.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
This does not mean that Comelec may flip or flop as it wishes in any given
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is governed by the decisive
criterion of the law and the controlling doctrinal jurisprudence reaffirmed in <u>Aratuc</u>
itself as the "polestar", which I beg to state once again, that where
as in this case there has been <u>actual voting</u>, the election returns must
be accorded <u>prima facie</u> status as <u>bona fide</u> reports of the voting
for canvass and proclamation purposes and the proper remedy in case of
complaints of election irre­gularities is the <u>election protest</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where Comelec goes against the law and
controlling jurisprudence, it commits a grave abuse of power and discretion and
the Court must strike down its arbitrary action, if it is not to abdicate its
responsibility of judicial review under the Constitution and "slip into a
judicial inertia."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I therefore vote for the granting of Leonor Garcia's petition to
set aside the Comelec resolution, and with the proper inclusion in the canvass
of the 40 returns wrongfully excluded, to proclaim her as the duly elected
mayor of Cabanatuan City.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">II. Re the second case
(G.R</span>. 54277), as already indicated, it would be the grossest injustice,
given the majority judgment in the first case upholding Comelec's exclusion of
the 40 returns that deprived Leonor Garcia of her decisive margin of victory,
if she were to be de­prived even of her right to make "the whole truth
come to light" <span style="">in </span>the
appropriate election protest where the question of inclusion or exclusion of
the 40 returns could be properly "tried on the merits with the
presentation of all competent evidence, testimonial and real,"<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
instead of summary pre-proclamation proceedings with mere affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I <span style="">vote
therefore, with the majority in this second case, in its dis­missal of Honorato
C. Perez, Sr.'s petition which would set aside the Comelec resolution that
reinstated Leonor Garcia's election protest </span><u>ad </u><u><span style="">cautelam</span></u><span style=""> for proper determination after trial on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
