accused-appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.  At about 10:00 a.m. on
27 January 1992, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>civilian
informant reported to the office of the Intelligence Operations Group of the
Southern Police District Command the rampant "shabu" peddling <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">along Vergel </span>St., Pasay City.  Accused-appellant Rodolfo <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Salinas was identified </span>as one of those
engaged in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">illegal </span>trade.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Commanding <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Officer Danilo Caseres </span>then formed a
team composed of SPO3 Ely Ramos, SPO1 Manolito Tobias, PO2 Benito Basilio, Jr.,
PO2 Richard Palomata and PO2 Rolando Losaria to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">verify </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">report </span>and
conduct a buy-bust operation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  After <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">confirming </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">information given </span>by the civilian informant, a buy-bust <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">operation was </span>planned with PO2 Basilio
acting as the poseur-buyer.  Four (4)
P100-bills were then marked with the letters "IOG", <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">meaning </span>IntelliÂ­gence Operations
Group, and xerox copies thereof were made.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<blockquote>4.  At around <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">9:30 </span>p.m. on the same day (27 January

St. </span>together <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with </span>their informant
who introduced Basilio to Rodolfo Salinas as a buyer of "shabu".  Rodolfo Salinas asked Basilio how much
"shabu" he was buying.  PO2
Basilio said he wanted P400 worth and handed the four (4) marked P100-bills to
Salinas who then handed him (Basilio) a small plastic packet containing a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">white crystalline substance.  Basilio </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">then made the pre-arranged signal by
scratching his head, whereupon the other members of the team who were

the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-weight:

verified to be Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu) by Forensic Chemist Leslie
B. Chambers.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For his defense, accused-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">appellant </span>Rodolfo Salinas asserts that he was
"framed".  He claims that at
about 8:00 in the evening of 27 January 1992, he was on his way home when he
passed by Clarita's store and some friends invited him to have a few rounds of
beer with them.  After having a bottle
of beer, he excused himself so he could buy bread at a nearby bakery for his
breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rodolfo Salinas testified that it was while he was on his way to
the bakery that two (2) men confronted him.  One of them pointed a gun at him while the other showed him a white
plastic packet and told him, "This is yours; you are a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pusher."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

was then brought to Fort <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Bonifacio </span>and
questioned by the police and asked to name the drug pushers in Vergel St.  One of the policemen <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">allegedly </span>asked him for P20,000.00 in
exchange for his liberty.  It was when
he told them he had no money that he was brought to the Pasay City Prosecutor's
Office for further investigation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal Rodolfo Salinas enumerates the following alleged
contradictions and inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, which support
his acquittal:</p>

<blockquote>1. It was not clear whether a surveillance operation was conducted
prior to the alleged buy-bust operation; and assuming that a surveillance
operation was conducted, the exact time was not established as the testimonies
of the police officers mention <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>surveillance operation at 11:30 a.m. on 27
January 1992 and another, after the team was formed at around 6:00 p.m. on the
same day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  It was not clear who
designated PO2 Benito Basilio to act as the poseur-buyer.  PO2 Basilio had testified that it was his
commanding officer Lt. Caseres who designated him to be the poseur-buyer while
SPO3 Ely Ramos testified that it was he who assigned Basilio to be the
poseur-buyer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  It was not clear what
time the buy-bust team was formed.  PO2
Basilio testified that the team was formed after a civilian informant came and
reported to Lt. Danilo Caseres the rampant selling of shabu along Vergel St.,
Pasay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">City.  SPO3 Ely Ramos, on the other hand, testified
that the team was formed at around 6:00 p.m. of 27 January 1992.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  It is not clear how many
vehicles the buy-bust team used in going to Vergel St.  PO2 Basilio testified that they hired three
(3) tricycles while SO3 Ely Ramos said they used <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">only two (2).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  It is not clear whether
or not the members of the buy-bust team arrived simultaneously at Vergel
St.  PO2 Basilio testified that they arrived
simultaneously while SPO3 Ely Ramos testified that the other members arrived
five (5) minutes later.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.  It is not clear how the
sale of the "shabu" took place.  PO2 Basilio testified that the accused, Rodolfo Salinas asked him how
much "shabu" he was buying and he answered P400.00 and he handed the
four (4) P100 marked bills to the accused who after counting the money handed
the small plastic packet to him (Basilio).  On the other hand, SPO3 Ely Ramos testified that after Basilio was
introduced to the accused, he asked for P400.00 worth of "shabu" and
after some conversation the accused handed the "shabu" to Basilio who
then gave the pre-arranged signal for the buy-bust team to arrest the accused
Rodolfo Salinas.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is a long settled rule that the commission of the crime of
illegal sale of prohibited or regulated drugs is considered consumated once the
sale transaction is established.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In the case before </span>us,
the sale of "shabu" by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">accused
Rodolfo Salinas </span>to the poseur-buyer PO2 Benito <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Basilio, Jr. was </span>established by the latter's testimony.  The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">trial
court gave credence </span>to the testimony of Basilio over <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the testimonies of the defense </span>witnesses.  A close and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">careful scrutiny of </span>the records of this case shows no reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to disturb the findings </span>of the trial
court regarding the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">credibility of the
witnesses for </span>the prosecution, specially <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">since they are police officers </span>who are presumed to have <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">regularly performed their </span>official
duties, the contrary not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">having been
proven.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The alleged contradictions and inconsistencies are, in the main,
minor and immaterial since the sale of the regulated drug was clearly and
categorically established by the testimony of the poseur-buyer, PO2 Benito
Basilio, Jr.  The testimony of SPO3 Ely
Ramos regarding the sale of "shabu" by the accused Rodolfo Salinas to
PO2 Basilio cannot be expected to be as detailed and as accurate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the
latter's account because it was only Basilio who actually approached and
transacted with Salinas while SPO3 Ely Ramos stayed some distance away and strategically
positioned himself so he could see Basilio make the pre-arranged signal for the
arrest of Salinas.  The minor
inconsistencies as to the details of the sale of "shabu" may be
considered as badges of truth rather than of falsehood.<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
