Sr., Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span>, Laguna, <span class="GramE">and</span> his seven-year old son, Lotus, Jr., were shot and
killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They died almost instantly from
multiple gunshot wounds sustained on different parts of their bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirteen (13) persons were indicted in the
then Circuit Criminal Court, Laguna, as co-conspirators in the two killings,
categorized by the Provincial Fiscal as double murder qualified by treachery
and evident premeditation.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The persons indicted were the six (6) appellants herein -- Mario <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> <span class="SpellE">Sacop</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> de Guzman, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ladiana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> and Alfredo del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> --

<p class="BODY">On September 17, 1982, in the course of trial, Judge Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>, then presiding over the Circuit Criminal Court,
dismissed the case as against three of the defendants:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Isidro <span class="SpellE">Galema</span>, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Mercado and <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> for insufficiency of evidence and with the
conformity of the prosecution.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> During the trial, too, Bruno <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> died, and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Baldemeca</span>
escaped from his detention cell in the Philippine Constabulary stockade in
Santa Cruz, Laguna, and has since remained at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the prosecution had rested, Judge <span class="SpellE">Maximiano</span>
C. Asuncion succeeded Judge <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> and received
evidence for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 1,
1985, he rendered judgment:</p>

<p class="BODY">In these appellate proceedings, all the convicted defendants pray
that the judgment of conviction be reversed and they be acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contend that the Trial Court erred:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
according credit to the identification of Mario <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>
by <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span> y
Osorio, Judge <span class="SpellE">Sobejana's</span> mother-in-law;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having reviewed the record, the Court finds merit in these pleas
sufficient to justify a reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, on the question of identification:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on the version offered by the
prosecution, besides the killer himself, two persons actually witnessed the
double murder -- <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>,
the wife of Judge <span class="SpellE">Sobejana</span>, and her mother, <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> Osorio <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter provided what the Trial Court
described as "explicit and positive" testimony identifying appellant
Mario <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> as the triggerman, the decision pointing
out that she identified <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> no less than four (4)
times; at the crime scene moments after the shooting, then twice in the course
of the investigation conducted by the Philippine Constabulary, and finally
during the trial when she picked him out from among the persons then present in
the courtroom.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>
Closer examination shows, however, that such reliance has been largely
misplaced and that said witness’ testimony is not as strong and convincing as
it must have seemed to the Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that appears to have been elicited from her while at the scene of
the crime immediately or shortly after its commission was that the killer was a
stranger wearing a hat, one, however, whom she would recognize if she saw him
again.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
The same sketchy description was given by her to PC Col. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumbres</span> on the following day, July 7, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, about two weeks later at PC
Headquarters in Sta. Cruz, Laguna, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>
offered more details, such as that the killer was slim, fair-skinned, about
five feet five inches tall, sported slightly long hair, and wore a long-sleeved
fatigue shirt, denim pants and a <span class="SpellE">buri</span> hat,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a>
and supposedly picked <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> out of a line-up; but the
credibility of this as well as of her subsequent identification of <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> during trial, seriously suffers not only from the
length of time elapsed between their making and her encounter with the gunman
during the commission of the crime, but also because on these last two occasions,
<span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> was already established as a suspect -- a
circumstance that may have colored her recollection and conditioned her mind to
identify <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> as the unknown gunman whom she had
first seen for only the few brief moments that it took to carry out the double
killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there seems to be nothing in the record to show that <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> fitted <span class="SpellE">Alarcon's</span> later and
more detailed physical description of the killer, to wit and as already
stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>slim, fair-skinned, five feet
five, etc., which was given two weeks after the event.</p>

<p class="BODY">Identification evidence of this kind -- at best, inconclusive --
cannot, standing alone, provide sufficient basis for a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it is not supported by any other
evidence, not even by that of the other eyewitness, <span class="SpellE">Alarcon's</span>
own daughter, the widow <span class="SpellE">Sobejana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, according to investigators, was
in a state of shock and too distraught to give any statement at the crime
scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even after she had recovered
sufficiently, she failed to identify the assailant, though as she later
testified, she had known all the accused for a long time.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Advertence is made to the extrajudicial statement of Eduardo
Mercado that he saw <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> pass by the <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span> Academy on General Luna Street near the scene of the
crime a few minutes after the killings as corroborative of the testimony
identifying <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> as the killer.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a>
However, any value that might attach to said statement is negated by Mercado's
own later testimony disowning the same and claiming that he had been coerced by
the military into giving it.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the identification evidence against Mario <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> is equally fatal to the prosecution's theory of
conspiracy which hinges upon, and has for an essential ingredient, the alleged
association of the other accused with <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> in the planning
and commission of the double killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the proof has failed to tag <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>
as the one who did the actual killing renders <u>ipso facto</u> suspect
evidence the thrust and intendment of which is to show a conspiracy in which <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>, and not any one of the other alleged conspirators,
was assigned and agreed to carry out the part of killer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, running true to the form that the other
proof for the prosecution in this case has taken, such evidence (of conspiracy)
is similarly difficult to credit, both intrinsically and because coming from
hardly pristine sources.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was attempted to prove conspiracy among the accused through
the testimony of Pedro de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and Jose de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, father and son, which imputed to said accused
acts and conduct such as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) their
entering the office of Judge <span class="SpellE">Sobejana</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span> municipal hall on June 10, 1980 (not June 9, as
erroneously stated in the appealed decision) and uttering threats against his
life; (b) their <span class="SpellE">reconnaisance</span> of the place where the
killing took place two days before that event; (c) their having engaged in an
all-day drinking spree on the day of the killing in a nearby house belonging to
one of them (<span class="SpellE">Zenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>);
(d) their furtive, unusual and suspicious movements in or about the vicinity of
the crime scene on that same day before and after the killings; and (e)
overheard utterances like "<span class="SpellE">nayari</span> din,"
indicative of guilty knowledge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Asuncion, who wrote the appealed decision, never heard
these witnesses testify -- as already observed, it was his predecessor, Judge
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>, who heard the entire case for the
People -- had little basis for approvingly adjudging their testimony as given
"* * in a straightforward and simple manner * *"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>
and obviously giving it his full credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This he did despite the existence of evidence not seriously contradicted
that these witnesses had their own axes to grind, grievances against the
appellants, which should have dictated more caution in evaluating the truth and
candor of what they said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That evidence
is to the effect that the brothers Hector and <span class="SpellE">Zenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> and said witnesses had not only political
differences, but also disputes concerning lands retrieved from them by the <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> family, to the possession and income of which they
felt themselves entitled; that Jose de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and
Benjamin de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes had been dismissed from their
casual employment with the Bureau of Public Highways by Engineer Ruben <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>, brother of <span class="SpellE">Zenon</span>; that a
collection suit had been filed against Pedro de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes by <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>-owned Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Zenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> was a witness in a case of grave threats filed
against Pedro <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes by <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
de Guzman;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a>
that appellant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ladiana</span> had been Pedro de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes’ political rival, who had bested him in the
election for <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain of <span class="SpellE">Salac</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span>, and he (<span class="SpellE">Ladiana</span>)
had also been suspected by Pedro to be behind the petition of <span class="SpellE">Salac</span> residents denouncing the latter for mismanaging <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> affairs; that Jose de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes had had a quarrel with <span class="SpellE">Ladiana</span> inside a
precinct during the local elections, and <span class="SpellE">Ladiana</span>
claimed that Jose owed him some still unpaid gambling debts; that appellant <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> <span class="SpellE">Sacop</span>, for his part, had
been suspected of stoning the house of Pedro de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes, for which Pedro, armed with a bolo had chased <span class="SpellE">Sacop</span>
and Jose de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes had tried to stab him with a
knife; and that Pedro also had a score to settle with <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
de Guzman who had filed a still pending case against him for grave threats.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from these <u>indicia</u> of the <span class="SpellE">Reyeses</span>’
possible bias and motive to testify falsely, it simply is difficult to believe
that parties bent on a common felonious purpose would so recklessly advertise
their intentions and call attention to themselves by holding a day-long
drinking spree within plain sight of the place where they planned to kill their
victim that very same day, their actions visible to every curious eye; and when
not huddled together in drink, conspicuously skulking about the vicinity and
generally acting as if they were waiting for something out of the ordinary to
happen or were helping make it happen -- actions that observers would in
hindsight equate with guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more
natural tendency of conspirators who had planned a killing and agreed to let
one of their number carry it out is for the rest to arrange to be somewhere
other than at the scene of the crime at its planned time of commission to avoid
any suspicion fastening upon them or provide themselves with alibis in case it
did.</p>

<p class="BODY">The credibility of the appealed decision is not helped any by
indications that the Trial Judge had reached his own adverse conclusions about
appellant <span class="SpellE">Ablao's</span> character, if not his guilt, even
before all the evidence was in and by the presence therein of findings to which
the recorded proofs offer no support except upon loose inferences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It describes <span class="SpellE">Ablao's</span>
alleged actions after the killing as those of a “professional killer”<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>
on apparently no more solid basis than that said appellant had earlier been
convicted and sentenced to death for what the Trial Judge described as a
"cold-blooded murder"<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> in another case also heard by him
-- said remarks being clearly uncalled for in the context in which they were
made and considering that <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> was facing a capital
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It credits the widow <span class="SpellE">Sobejana</span> with seeing, or declaring that she had seen, <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> de Guzman
reconnoitering the vicinity of the crime scene on July 4, 1980 and passing
through an alley later used as an escape route by <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>
after shooting Judge <span class="SpellE">Sobejana</span> and his son.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a>
What is, however, of record as to her actual testimony is no more than that on
said occasion, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> de Guzman, accompanied by a
long-haired man wearing a fatigue-cloth jacket, <span class="SpellE">maong</span>
pants and <span class="SpellE">buri</span> hat (whom she did not however
recognize or identify as <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>) had walked past where
she was seated on a bench in a neighbor's house.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a> Similarly, nothing in the
transcripts warrants describing as "frantic" or "unusual"
huddles and movements, as does the appealed decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>
otherwise normal and commonplace actions on the part of some of the accused
like conversing while they walked past what was to become the scene of the
crime on their way to buy cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After linking David <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> to the crimes by
stating that he must have accompanied the triggerman, Mario Ablao,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a>
the decision proceeds to acquit him for insufficiency of evidence, in effect
relegating that <span class="SpellE">implicatory</span> statement to the area of
mere surmise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of similar stripe is the
statement that the case seemed but another episode in the "vicious cycle
of cases in <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span>, Laguna traceable to factional
strife,"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
which, besides not being exactly relevant, appears to be a conclusion born of
the Trial Judge's conception of the backgrounds of other cases he had tried
rather than on any evidence presented in this particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, from the wealth of observations made
in that judgment, it is not easy to separate what His Honor regarded as founded
on hard evidence from those which were simple speculation or conjecture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also -- and though favorable to appellant <span class="SpellE">Zenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>, it is another
inconsistency, the appealed decision does not make clear why appellant <span class="SpellE">Zenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> was found guilty
only as an accessory after the fact notwithstanding its having found as fact
that the conspiracy was hatched in his own home, that he was the one who had
brought Mario <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> there in the morning of the day
of the killings, and that he had been present in the <span class="SpellE">Lumban</span>
municipal building on that occasion of June 10, 1980 when the other appellants
had barged into the office of Judge <span class="SpellE">Sobejana</span>
allegedly with the intention of doing him bodily harm.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Error was further committed in giving weight and credence to the
alleged confession of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Baldemeca</span>, one of the
original accused who escaped from detention and has since remained at large, as
evidence against Mario <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There having been no opportunity on the part
of the defense, which objected to its presentation,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
to examine <span class="SpellE">Baldemeca</span> about said confession, it is
inadmissible hearsay entitled to no consideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the whole and in view of the conspicuous deficiencies and
shortcomings of the evidence for the prosecution, whatever suspicions about the
complicity of the appellants in the killing of Judge <span class="SpellE">Sobejana</span>
and his son are not promoted to any reasonable certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said evidence, insufficient, in the Court's
considered view after due examination and evaluation, to pinpoint Mario <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span> as the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span> or to
establish the existence a conspiracy among the appellants to take the lives of
said victims, fails to overcome the presumption of innocence and erase all
reasonable doubts of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The verdict
of the Trial Court and the respect and acceptance that by precedent its
findings of fact would otherwise ordinarily command notwithstanding, the
appellants are entitled to an acquittal.</p>
