fell wounded and was brought to the <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> Hospital where he died at around 11:00 o'clock

aforementioned firearm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
deformity of the lead bullet and the two metallic fragments extracted from the

crime, the relationship between the family of the victim Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> and the family of the late mayor Jose <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> (father of accused) had been strained by the
question of ownership and management of the Rosario cockpit, the former
claiming full payment on the purchase price of the cockpit and the land where
it stood, while the latter claiming otherwise (pp. 232-250, <span style="font-size:9.0pt">TSN, </span>Sept. 19, 1983).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, in addition to the incident on the afternoon

accused to get down from the railing of the cockpit causing the latter's
embarrassment (p. 97, TSN, May 2, 1983); the quarrel between <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> and the daughter
of the deceased, Rose Ann <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> (pp. 32-34, TSN,
Jan. 7, 1983); and the threat of Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span>,
brother of the accused that 'If you are fighting us, you cannot come out from
this cockpit alive' (p. 46, TSN, April 4, 1983); all culminated in the fatal
shooting of Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">As a general proposi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:30.0pt">t</span>ion,
the findings of the trial court are not to be disturbed on appeal unless there
are substantial facts which it overlooked and which, if duly considered, might
affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the issue is on the credibility of witnesses, generally the findings of
the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal since it was in a better
position to determine that question, it having heard and observed the demeanor
of the witnesses,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>unless <span style="font-size:13.0pt">certain

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, however, the case for the People and the conviction
handed down by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> are based on circumstantial
evidence, no eyewitness to the actual shooting by an identified assailant
having been presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
stressed by the defense, such circumstantial evidence suffices to convict but
only if there is more than one circumstance, that the facts from which the
inferences are derived are proven, and the combination of all the circumstances
is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Our review has necessarily been geared to a scrupulous assessment of whether
the concatenation of the facts proven in this case lead to the reasonable
conclusion that the guilt of herein appellant has been sustained by the
requisite quantum of evidence excluding all and every<i>,</i> reasonable
hypothesis consistent with his innocence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has been felicitously assisted in that quest by the
anticipatory action of the trial judge who, in his decision, commendably
summarized the relevant testimonies of the principal witnesses and on which,
together with the documentary evidence presented and admitted, he anchored his
findings and conclusions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have
assayed the correctness of each <span class="SpellE">precis</span> of testimony
through a review of the 958 textual pages of transcripts of the proceedings in
the trial court and We <span style="font-size:13.0pt">find the same accurate
and sufficient for purposes of appellate review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With some modifications, therefore, the testimonial bases adduced
by the prosecution<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

evidence.</p>

to the south and while passing the cockpit he noticed that somebody was being

intracranial, severe, secondary to gunshot wound, head, left side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The witness confirmed his findings appearing
in Exhibit 'B', the Autopsy report which he identified, together with his
signature (Exhibit 'B-1') and the signature of NBI Regional Director Oscar de
Leon (Exhibit 'B-2').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further stated
that he found one gunshot wound at the left temporal region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bullet that caused the wound was
recovered in the back portion of the head, left side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no gunshot wound of exit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Per his findings, there was no evidence of
close firing due to the absence of gun powder and the distance between the
muzzle of the gun and the victim was beyond 2 1/2 meters and it is possible
that the assailant was 20 meters away from the victim or even farther.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bullet that was recovered at the back of
the head of the deceased was composed of three fragments; two small ones and
one big fragment which was lodged at the exterior portion of the left side of
the head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fragments were irregularly
shaped and even the bigger one was badly deformed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The possible cause of the fragmentation of
the bullet into three pieces was the fact that the bullet came in contact with
the bone and during the contact or impact of the bullet with the hard surface
of the bone, it had (the) tendency to split and some of the smaller fragments
were imbedded in the area near the entrance while the bigger one which had bigger
force was imbedded inside the occipital region."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Holmes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After buying beer <span class="SpellE">grande</span>, he and his companions proceeded to Gerry's house at

to borrow her radio cassette. He was able to borrow but <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> told him to return the radio cassette when it
is already dark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Returning home, he and
his companions George Holmes, Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and Romeo
<span class="SpellE">Galimba</span> were still drinking beer <span class="SpellE">grande</span>
when his aunt <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
came <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>his house at 7:00 o'clock

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What cannot escape attention, however, is the virtual dovetailing
of the sequence of events of that alleged drinking spree and the congruence of
details-- such as the liquor drunk on that occasion, the participants and their
respective entries on the scene, the duration of the alcoholic session from
around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon to about 8:00 o'clock in the evening, and
even the time when the musical cassettes were borrowed and returned-- all these
being vividly recounted by the participants about two years after the
event.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that such identical
features in the testimony of several witnesses cannot but generate the
suspicion that the material circumstances testified to by them were integral
parts of a well thought of and prefabricated story.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will also be readily noted that, unlike
most of the witnesses for the prosecution who were of diverse origins and not
relatives or associates of the victim, the aforesaid defense witnesses are
related to or are close friends of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">As hereinabove observed, the prosecution and the defense are
agreed that the house of the appellant where the drinking affair supposedly
took place, on hours placed by the appellant's witnesses to be coeval with the
time when the events culminating in the shooting incident took place, is only
around 400 to 500 meters from the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the appellant was definitely
identified and established as having been in the cockpit before and shortly
after the incident after which he and his companions hurriedly left the
scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine has long been
accepted that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive
identification of the accused by the<b><span style="color:teal"> </span></b>prosecution
witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, there is the matter of the positive results of the
paraffin test which showed the right and left hands of the appellant to be
positive for nitrates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's
attempts to explain away the presence of the specks of nitrates on his hands,
as having come from sources like matches and fertilizer, were readily refuted
by the forensic chemist who conducted the diphenylamine test, Luz A. <span class="SpellE">Emecilla</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She explicitly
explained in her testimony, <u>supra</u>, that the left and right, hands can be
positive for nitrates where both hands are used in firing a gun; and that while
it is possible that nitrates could lodge in the hands from striking a match or
handling fertilizer, the appearance of nitrates from gunpowder is different
from nitrates coming from matches, fertilizers or other sources.</p>

<p class="BODY">Much emphasis is placed by the defense on the fact that, as a
result of an accident in February, 1981, where a motorized tricycle sideswiped
the right foot of appellant, said foot allegedly became shorter and thinner;
that he underwent medical attention and surgery; and that he was still limping
during the shooting incident on August 1, 1982.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
This was obviously intended to lay the premise that because of such physical
defect and incapacity, with the corresponding diminution of his power of
locomotion, the appellant could not have participated in the shooting incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows, however, that appellant was actually confined
in the hospital for only eight days after the accident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
On rebuttal, Dr. Alvaro <span class="SpellE">Orejano</span>, Chief of the
Orthopedic Section of the University of the East, testified that the X-ray
film, which was presented <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the
trial court as Exhibit G of the prosecution and showed the patella of the right
leg of the appellant, indicated that the injury was completely healed with a
piece of wire imbedded at the periphery of the patella.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to the power of locomotion, he declared
that the appellant could walk, walk fast and even run.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He explained that the piece of wire imbedded
in the knee does not affect the power of locomotion of the appellant; that the
ordinary full healing period of the fracture of the patella is six to eight
months; that the recovery involved full restoration of function so that the
knee could be fully flexed, with the wire intact, hence the injured person
could start walking in three months, and that such injury of the appellant
would not shorten the leg since it does not involve a weight-bearing bone.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn48" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">M/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Bergonia</span>,
Jr. declared that while the appellant was detained at their station in <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>, La Union, the latter was in good physical condition
and could walk by himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
witness saw the appellant again in November, 1984 running after a bus he
intended to board.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn49" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
This was not rebutted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Maj. Juan <span class="SpellE">Refe</span> testified that when he
went to the <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> residence after the shooting
incident to invite the appellant to his office in connection with the
investigation he was conducting, the appellant was walking alone when he went
to board the car; and that the appellant also walked alone by himself to the
third floor of the building where Maj. <span class="SpellE">Refe</span> had his
office.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn50" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was not unexpected for the appellant and his original
co-accused, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Milana</span>, to disclaim that they knew
each other or that they were together at the time of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Milana</span> had
to admit in his testimony that he was appointed policeman of Rosario, La Union
by the then Mayor Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> and that he was
detailed once a month in the residence of the mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He<span style="font-size:29.0pt"> </span>further
admitted that on the date of the incident, he was armed with the revolver which
was later established to have fired the bullet recovered from the scene of the
crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn51" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
It is also to be recalled that he was positively identified and seen together
with the appellant leaving the cockpit shortly after the shooting incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly held that -?</p>

<blockquote>"Where the events constitute a compact mass of circumstantial
evidence, the existence of every bit of which was satisfactorily proved, and
the proof of each is confirmed by the proof of the other, and all without
exception leading by mutual support to but one conclusion, the circumstantial

reasonable doubt."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn52" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

this purpose (23 CJS, p. 555).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
general rule has been formulated as to the quantity of circumstantial evidence
which will suffice for any case but that matters not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For all that is required is that the

<p class="BODY">Our review and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ratiocination
</span>based on the entire records and proven facts of this case yield the
inescapable conclusion that the prosecution's evidence, albeit circumstantial,
is of a sufficient quantum to establish the guilt of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The catena of circumstances proven by <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> evidence -- that the appellant and his
co-accused were seen hastily leaving the scene of the shooting incident shortly
thereafter; that he was found positive for nitrates in the paraffin test
conducted on him; that he was at the time in the company of the patrolman who
had the gun subsequently identified to have fired a bullet recovered at the
scene and which firearm, therefore, was not inaccessible to him; that the
animosity and rancor existing between his family and that of the victim
provided an adequate psychological compulsion and sufficient motive for the
assault; and the inherent weakness of his defense, not only because it was one
of alibi but also because of the partisan sources of the testimony <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> -- cannot but convince Us that, in justice to the
victim, a conviction should be decreed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> correctly held that there are no
