<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version, as culled by the Solicitor General, is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the evening of June 17, 1988 at around 6:30 o'clock in the
afternoon, Mr. Ambrocio Baillo, his thirteen (13) year old son Jaime Baillo and
his wife Concepcion Baillo just came from the "tabuan" (flea market)
at Barangay Anhawan, Dauin, Negros Oriental and were heading for home at
Barangay Daku, Dauin, Negros Oriental (TSN, January 3, 1984, pp. 4-5; TSN,
April 10, 1989, pp. 4-5).  Just after
crossing the Maayong-tubig river and while walking one behind the other
(Ambrocio, Jaime then Concepcion) along the trail, suddenly and without any
warning, they were shot from behind (Ibid.).  Concepcion, being hit and mortally wounded, fell down and cried
"agi!" (Ibid.).  Jaime also
fell down because he was hit at the back and at the left hip.  Ambrocio was not hurt.  Upon seeing his wife and son fall, he
instructed his son Jaime to hide as he was going to get a vehicle (TSN, April
10, 1989, pp. 5-7).  Immediately,
Ambrocio ran away and proceeded directly to their house and told his other son
Rogelio to go and see his mother and younger brother Jaime who were shot at
Malungcay Daku (Ibid., p. 7).  Then
Ambrocio reported the incident to the police of Dauin and to the parish priest
(Father Badoy) whose truck they used to return to the place of the incident (Ibid.,
p. 8).  Policemen Ikoy Tubil and Dadoy
Elumir rode on the truck while Ambrocio rode with June Alta Marino on the
latter's motorcycle (Ibid., p. 9).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Meantime, at the scene of the incident, Jaime, upon being
instructed by his father Ambrocio, was able to crawl and hide himself behind a
hagonoy plant despite the wounds he sustained (TSN, January 3, 1989, p.
5).  While hiding, two (2) men whom he
recognized as their neighbors - Belarmino Divina and Mecrito Baga (accused-appellants)
approached the lifeless body of his mother (Ibid.).<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Belarmino Divina, with a gun, said in the dialect: "PUSIL
RAY TAMBAL SA MGA TESTIGOS SA CONTRA SA MGA DIVINA" which means "ONLY
THE GUN CAN SILENCE THOSE WITNESSES AGAINST THE DIVINAS" (Ibid., p. 6).  (The records show that victim Concepcion
Baillo was a witness against the Divinas in another pending case.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, Rogelio Baillo, after being told by his father of the
incident, immediately proceeded to Malungcay-Daku, the place of the incident
(TSN, April 10, 1989, P. 33).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon arrival, he was told by his brother Jaime that Belarmino
Divina and Mecrito Baga had approached the dead body of their mother Concepcion
Baillo with Belarmino holding a gun (Ibid., p. 35).  Rogelio saw wounds at the arms and at the back of his mother and
he was not able to talk with her anymore (Ibid., 36).  He also observed that Jaime sustained wounds at his left hip and
at the back (Ibid.).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, at about 10:00 o'clock that same evening, Ambrocio
Baillo arrived with the truck of Fr. Badoy accompanied by policemen Ikoy Tubil
and Dadoy Elumir and, Jun Alta Marino, a teacher in Malungcay Daku.  Ambrocio noticed that his wife, Concepcion
was already dead while his son Jaime was alive (Ibid., pp. 9-10).  Ambrocio further observed that his wife Concepcion
sustained six (6) wounds at the back and both her arms were lacerated
(Ibid.).  His son Jaime also sustained
gunshot wounds at the back and at the left hip (Ibid.).  They then loaded the dead body of Concepcion
on the truck and brought her to their house while Jaime was brought to the
provincial hospital for treatment (Ibid.).  Jaime was operated twice.  As
testified to by the attending physician, Dr. Nerissa Calumpang, Jaime could
have died were it not for the timely medical attention <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(TSN, </span>April 11, 1989, pp. 2-18).  Jaime was discharged only after two (2) weeks of confinement
after which, he temporarily lived with their relatives at Valencia (a nearby
municipality) because of fear that he might be killed by the Divinas (TSN,
March 29,1989, p. 18)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused Belarmino Divina has been living in his
parents-in-law's house at Anhawan, Dauin, Negros Oriental, since January,
1984.  (TSN, January 31, 1990,
p.2).  He was the OIC Barangay Captain
of Anhawan since 1986 up to May, 1988 (ibid., p. 3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On June 17, 1988, from .7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., he was plowing in
his farm; after which he ate his lunch.  At about 3:00 p.m. of the same day, he went to the "tabu-an",
(a flea market) about 40 meters from his in-law's house where he met Sabino
Sarense, Dedio Tubil, Porferio Tubil, Alberto Deloria and Nicolas Sarense.  At about 3:30 p.m., the group, including
accused Divina, played volley-ball.  The
group finished playing at about 4:00 p.m. after which they ate bread.  At about 5:30 p.m. accused Divina invited
the group to his in-law's house where he also lives with his family, to drink
tuba.   The group was joined by Tony
Regalado and Lucero Regalado, accused Divina's brothers-in-law.  They drank tuba until 7:00 p.m. that night
after which accused Divina with his family, Dedio Tubil and Porferio Tubil
stayed around to view the TV.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sabino Sarense, after the group stopped drinking at 7:00 p.m., left
together with his son Nicolas Sarense and Alberto Deloria.  The rest of their group, Dedio Tubil,
Porferio Tubil and accused Divina with his family were watching the TV.  At about 8:00 p.m., Dedio and Porferio Tubil
also left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused Divina came to know of the killing of Concepcion Baillo the
following day, June 18, 1988.  Since
that day accused Divina never heard of the identity of the suspect until he was
arrested on July 26, 1988, as the suspect himself at about 4:00 p.m., at the
Poblacion of Dauin while waiting for transportation going to Anhawan where he
lives."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

Baga's defense is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

field on June 17, 1988, starting from 7:00 o'clock in the morning until 11:00
o'clock that morning and from 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon to 5:00 o'clock in
the afternoon that same day.  They
rested for a while in the house of Douglas Divina and at about 6:00 o'clock
p.m. Mecrito Baga with his mother Nicolasa Baga joined the Divina family in
praying the Holy Rosary which prayer had been going on for the last six
months.  After the prayer which ended at
about 7:00 o'clock in the evening, accused Mecrito Baga and his mother joined
the Divina family for supper.  After
supper, Mecrito Baga joined Guillermo Divina, Douglas Divina and Restituto
Delvo in drinking tuba.  At about 9:00
o'clock in the evening, Mecrito Baga and his mother left the residence of
Douglas Divina.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mecrito Baga learned about the killing of Concepcion Baillo and the
wounding of her son the following day, June 18, 1988, but he never heard of any
suspect, not until July 25, 1988, when he was arrested by four policemen in his
