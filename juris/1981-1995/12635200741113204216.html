				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners seek to annul the decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1978</st1:date> of Labor Arbiter Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>, Jr. in Case No. LRD-RO4-3-3067-'76 for illegal
dismissal and underpayment filed by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Librado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canicosa</span> against the University of Santo Tomas, et
al. with the Regional Office No. 4 Department (Ministry of Labor) ordering the
reinstatement of respondent <span class="SpellE">Canicosa</span> to his former
position of Personnel Health Officer with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
and the resolution dated May 29, 1980 of the National Labor Relations
Commission issued in NLRC Case No. RB-IV-5982-77 affirming said decision of the
Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant facts are as stated in the Resolution of the NLRC,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sometime in July, 1950, the complainant was extended an
appointment as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">instructor in </span>respondent's
Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. About the same time, he agreed under an
informal arrangement to act as Medical Officer of the respondent, to serve the
medical needs of all employees of the University and its hospital, first
without compensation but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">only gifts on </span>special
occasions. After about <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">two </span>years,
he was given a salary of P100.00 per month. Beginning 1970, he was required to
hold office daily from <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 p.m.</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="17"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">5:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>Monday thru Friday and to make <span class="GramE">himself</span> available at all times within short notice for
emergency cases, including Saturday mornings to which he complied.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"During the first term in office of the
incumbent Director of the <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span> Tomas
University Hospital, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>,
a reorganization of the hospital <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>under­taken on account of complainant's
expressed dissatisfaction with the apparent lack of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">recognition </span>and/or relegation of his status as Medical Officer,
it was proposed, approved and embodied in the reorganization plan and in the
Manual of Personnel Policies and Procedures that a Personnel Health Service
headed by a Personnel Health Officer be formally reorganized and created. By
letter dated 6 August 1975 sent by Director <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>
the complainant as Personnel Health Officer, the latter's duties were precisely
defined; his monthly salary was increased to P200.00; and his term of office
was fixed up to 31 October 1975. Still protesting the inadequacy of the
compensation, complainant nevertheless assumed the position beginning January,
1975.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime in August, 1975, the complainant applied for a leave
of absence for the period from <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="9">15
 September 1975</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="10">31
 October 1975</st1:date> for a trip abroad, which application was approved.
Upon his return, he found another appointed to his position of Personnel Health
Officer. The new appointee was later on granted a monthly salary of P500.00.
The complainant demanded reinstatement but he was advised that his term of
office expired on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="10">31 October 1975</st1:date>
and was not reappointed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears, however, that during the complainant's tenure, he
openly denounced the management of STUH for alleged violations of labor laws;
he also opposed the application for Filipino citizenship of its Administrator
and co-chairman of respondent's Management Committee, Fr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cabezon</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, Labor Arbiter Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>,
Jr. rendered a decision which, as earlier indicated, ordered the reinstatement
of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa</span> to his former position of Personnel
Health Officer with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1975</st1:date> until his actual
reinstatement. Petitioners appealed to the NLRC which, however, affirmed the
appealed decision and dismissed the appeal for obvious lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the present petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that respondent entered into the duties of the
newly organized office with a term without protesting any feature thereof
except the monthly salary and this constitutes an implied acceptance of the
offer although he had the option to reject and remain in his old position; and
that in accepting the new position and knowing the conditions attached thereto,
in effect, he abandoned his old office which is incompatible with the new.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners likewise contend that it was a whimsical and
capricious act of judgment or exercise of discretion for the NLRC to have
applied the amended version of Article 270 of the Labor Code to acts prior to
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> thereof when it declared that
respondent had acquired tenure in his old job and that "his tenure cannot
be converted into one with a definite period."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further argued by petitioners that Article 270 as amended
took effect on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1975</st1:date>
and should not be made to apply to an employment contract entered into in
August, 1974 and ended with the expiration of the period stipulated therein on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1975</st1:date>. According to
petitioners, the reason why the amended version was invoked rather than the
original thereof is that Articles 268-272, inclusive, in their original form
and style, unmistakably discloses the law's recognition of the validity and
legitimacy of "fixed-period employment" or employment with a definite
term and that in the light of the labor code provisions in force during all the
time material to the controversy, it was perfectly licit and proper for parties
to an employ­ment contract to agree on a definite or fixed term.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the finding of the NLRC that the fixing of the
term of office of respondent is ill-motivated as it was aimed at easing
respondent out of the service since he had openly denounced the management of
the Santo Tomas University Hospital for alleged violation of labor laws,
petitioners countered that such a conclusion has no basis or contrary to the
evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Memorandum appeal<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
submitted by petitioners to the NLRC, it is shown that the reorganization of
the hospital materialized only on account of respondent's expressed
dissatisfaction with the lack of recognition of his status as Medical Officer.
The contention of petitioners that the old position (Medical Officer) is
incompatible with the new (Personnel Health Officer) does not hold water. It is
precisely because of respondent's complaint which compelled petitioners to
change the designation of the former from Medical Officer to Personnel Health
Officer. As aptly <span class="SpellE">fround</span> by the Labor Arbiter and
affirmed by the NLRC, the positions of Medical Health Officer and Person­nel
Health Officer are one and the same; the duty of res­pondent remains also the
same and that is, to serve the medical needs of the employees. In effect, there
was a mere change of title or designation. As the Labor Arbiter stated:</p>

<blockquote>"But the mere change of title of the position does not x <span class="SpellE">x</span> alter the situation because his (Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span>)
main duty -- that of taking care of the health of the about 800 personnel of
the hospital, was never changed. Not even the increase of the salary to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P200.00 </span>a month, considering that the
increase of P100.00<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span>was still insufficient if we take into account the duties and responsibilities
imposed on the occupant of the position." <span class="GramE">(p. 5, Annex
E, Id.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above finding of the Labor Arbiter is affirmed by the NLRC as
the latter ruled that "There is likewise no question that fundamentally,
his duties remained the same, that of serving the medical needs of the
personnel. Under this state of facts, it is indubitable that the Medical
Officer and the Personnel Health Officer are one and the same position. There
was merely a change of title as can be deduced from the fact that the complainant
who was Medical Officer was automatically addressed as Person­nel Health
Officer in the <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="8">6 August 1974</st1:date>
letter informing him of his job description." This finding of fact arrived
at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by </span>both the Labor Arbiter and
the NLRC is binding upon <span class="GramE">Us</span> and it is not within Our
province to review nor revise the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the facts of the case and the very nature of res­pondent's
employment, it is indubitably shown that he was engaged to perform activities
which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the
Univer­sity and that he was not hired for a specific project or undertaking the
completion of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the
employee since he had been performing the same duties for the past 25 years.
Evidently, respondent's employment is regular, thus he is entitled to security
of tenure. Even on the assumption that respondent tacitly agreed to the
conditions in the contract as to his term of office, it did not affect his
regular status. Petitioners themselves in their memorandum admitted that
respondent was a regular employee and that since his employment in July, 1950
until <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="10">October 31, <span class="GramE">1975</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> he had been continuing his service as Medical/Personnel
Health Officer. We quote hereunder petitioner's memorandum as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"4.2. <u>DR. CANICOSA'S PRIOR STATUS AS "REGULAR EMPLOYEE</u>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>In November, 1974, respondent <span class="SpellE">Canicosa</span>

 <st1:placetype>Univer­sity</st1:placetype></st1:place>. He was in fact then

<p class="BODY">By such admission, petitioners impliedly concede that
respondent's case falls within the purview of Article 270 as amended by P.D.
850, considering that he had been engaged to perform activities usually
necessary in the trade or business of his employer, that is, ministering to the
medical and health needs of all the employees of petitioner Univer­sity of
Santo Tomas, including those of the Santo Tomas Uni­versity Hospital, which are
usually necessary or desirable in petitioner's usual business, that of
operating a university or school. By reason of the very nature of complainant's
em­ployment, the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">is </span>thereby rendered as regular and may not be terminated except
for a just cause or when authorized by the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention that the NLRC committed "a
whimsical, capricious, arbitrary act of judgment, a grave abuse of discretion
in giving retroactive effect to the amended version of Article 270 (by virtue
of Section 33, P.D. 850 [now, Article 281 of the Labor Code] which became
effective in December, 1975 as to become applicable in Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span>
case who was employed in July, 1950 as Medical Officer, until October 31, 1975,
by which time he was con­tinuing his services as Personnel Health Officer, is
without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Whether the original provision of Art.</span>
270 of the Labor Code (Employment <span class="GramE">Without</span> a Fixed
Period) or the amended one is applied, the criterion in either case is the same
- respondent's employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is </span>desirable or necessary in the usual business of the employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, the Comment of the Solicitor General to the
petition is well-taken, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"16.
Petitioners' theory, however, appears to concede that respondent Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span> case may well fall within the pale of Article
270 as amended by Sec. 33 of PD No. 850, consider­ing that his employment as
Personnel Health Officer 'shall be deemed regular' since he 'had been engaged
to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual
business or trade of the employer' (his ministration to the medical needs of
all the employees of petitioner University of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Tomas, including that of the STUH, being 'usually necessary or desirable' in
its usual business [operating a university or school]); and that, therefore,
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span> employment as such is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">regular</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">, </span>despite the fact that his designation as Personnel Health
Officer was for a fixed period, i.e. up to October 31, 1975, in which case he
could have had security of tenure in that petitioner University of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas cannot just terminate his services, 'except for
a just cause or when authorized by this Title' ('Title I - Termination of
Employment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Art. 269.
Security of tenure', as amended by PD No. 850);</blockquote>

<blockquote>"17. On the
other hand, even were respondent NLRC to rely on the <u>original</u> Art. 270
of the Labor Code ("Employment without <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">a </span>fixed period - An employment shall be deemed to be without a
definite period for purpose of this Title ['Title I - Termination of
Employment'] where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which
are usually necessary or de­sirable in the usual business or trade of the
employer, x x'), Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span> appointment or
designation as Personnel Health Officer (the latter, up to October 31, 1975)
also 'shall be deemed to be without a definite period for pur­poses of this
Title <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x', </span>considering that his
employment as such was necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of
the employer x x', which is to minister to the medical needs of all the employees
of petitioner University of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="GramE">Tomas,
including those of the STUH.</span> In this even, he was assured of security of
tenure, according to the provisions of the <u>original</u> Sec. 269 ('Security
of tenure') of the Labor Code (<span class="GramE">'In</span> cases of employment
without a definite period, the employer shall not terminate the services of an
employee, except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x');<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"18. In fine,
petitioners' indulgence over a web of 'legal niceties' is merely an exercise in
futility. Whether Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span> case comes within
the ambit of the provisions of the <u>original</u> Articles 269 and 270, or
within that of the provisions of the <u>amended</u> Articles 269 and 270, is
immaterial. Both under the original provisions of Articles 269 and 270 and the
amended provisions of Articles 269 and 270, respondent Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa</span>
<u>is entitled</u> to security of tenure, as he had been engaged while in the <span class="GramE">employ</span> of petitioner University of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Tomas in the performance of 'activities which are usually necessary or
desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer' (i.e., ministering to
the medical needs of all emplo­yees of <span class="GramE">petitioner</span>
University of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="GramE">Tomas, including
those of the STUH).</span> In either case, the criterion is one and the same,
which is that 'the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are
usually necessary or de­sirable in the usual business or trade of the
employer.' The employee is thereby assured of his security of tenure. Thus,
able counsel for petitioners had needlessly engrossed himself with worrying
over whether or not the amended version of Article 270 (including that of
Article 269) should be <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">given
'retroactive </span>effect' or should be applicable 'retrospectively'; "<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A comparative analysis of the Articles referred to above will readily
show that under either version of the provisions thereof, whether original or
amended, respon­dent <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span> employment may not be
terminated except for a just cause or when authorized by the Code. Thus,</p>

<blockquote>Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, promulgated by PD 442
dated May 1, 1974:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 269. Security of tenure. - In cases of employment
without a definite period, the employer shall not terminate the services of an
employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Chapter. An
employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement
without loss of seniority rights and to his back wages com­puted from the time
his compensation was with­held from him up to the time of his reins­tatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 270. Employment without a fixed period. - An employment
shall be deemed to be without a definite period for purposes of this Chapter
where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usual­ly
necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except
where the employment has been fixed for a specific pro­ject or undertaking the
completion or termina­tion of which has been determined at the time of the
engagement of the employee or where the work or service to be performed is sea­sonal
in nature and the employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span>for
the duration of the season.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 271. Probationary and fixed-period employment. - The
termination of employment of probationary employees and those employed with a
fixed period shall be subject to such regulations as the Secretary of Labor may
prescribe to prevent the circumvention of the rights of the employees to be
secured in their employment as provided herein."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Sec. </span>33, PD
850 dated December 16, <span class="GramE">1975,</span> the above Articles were
amended to read as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 269. Security of Tenure. - In case of regular
employment, employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for
a just cause or when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly
dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss or
seniority rights and to his back wages computed from the time his compensation
was withheld from him up to the time of his reinstatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 270. Regular and Casual Employ­ment. - The provisions of
written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regard­less of the oral
agreements of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where
the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary
or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer except where the
employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking, the completion
or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of
the employee or where the work or service to be performed is seasonal in nature
and the employment is for the du­ration of the season.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by
the preceding paragraph: provided, that, any employee who has rendered at least
one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be
considered a regular employee with respect to the activity in which he is
employed and his employment shall continue while such actually exists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 271. Probationary Employment. - Probationary employment
shall not exceed six months from the date the employee started working, unless
it is covered by an apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer period. The
services of an employee who has been engaged in a probationary basis may be
terminated for a just cause or when he fails to qualify as a regular employee
in accor­dance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the
employee at the time of his engagement. An employee who is al­lowed to work
after a probationary period shall be considered a regular employee."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly then, even under the original provisions of Article 270,
where the employee has been engaged to per­form activities which are usually
necessary or desirable in the business or trade of the employer, the employment
is deemed to be without a definite period and pursuant to Art. 269 in such a
case of employment without a definite period, the employer shall not terminate
the services of the employee except for a just cause or when authorized by
Chapter I (Termination of Employment).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa's</span> employment
as Medical Officer from July, 1950 to August, 1975, a period of 25 years,
during which time he had been performing his duties serving the medical needs
of about 800 personnel of the petitioner University <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">which </span>indisputably are necessary and desirable in the business
of said petitioner, had certainly attained a regular status without a definite
period, thereby assuring for himself a security of tenure that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>fully protected under the Labor
Code. The Labor Code it­self requires that medical and dental services be
furnished by every employer to his employees pursuant to Art. 155 which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 155. - Emergency medical and dental services. - It shall
be the duty of every employer to furnish his employees in any locality with
free medical and dental attendance and facilities consisting of:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) The services of
a full-time regis­tered nurse when the number of employees exceeds fifty (50)
but not more than two hundred except when the employer does not maintain
hazardous work places, in which case the services of a graduate first-<span class="SpellE">aider</span> shall be provided for the protection of the workers,
where no registered nurse is available. The Secretary of Labor shall provided
by appro­priate regulations the services that shall be required where the
number of employees does not exceed fifty and shall determine by appropriate
order hazardous work places for purposes of this Article;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) The services of
a full-time registered nurse, a part-time physician and dentist, and an
emergency clinic, when the number of employees exceeds two hundred but not more
than three hundred; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) The services of
a full-time physician, dentists, and a full-time registered nurse as well as a
dental clinic, and an infirmary or emergency hospital with one bed capacity for
every one hundred employees, when the number of employees exceeds three
hundred.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In cases of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">hazardous </span>work
places, no em­ployer shall engage the services of a physician or dentist who
cannot stay in the premises of the establishment for at least two hours, in the
case of those engaged on part-time basis, and not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">less </span>than eight hours in the case of those employed on full-time
basis. Where the undertaking is non-­hazardous in nature, the physician and
dentist may be engaged on retained basis, subject to such regulations as the Secre­tary
of Labor may prescribe to insure immediate availability of medical and dental
treatment and attendance in case of emergency." (Pres. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Decree </span>No.
442, as amended by Pres. Decree No. 570-A).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We cannot subscribe to, nor agree with the theory of petitioners
that upon the reorganization of the hospital and the creation of the Office of
Personnel Health Officer and respondent having been informed thereof by letter
of Director <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> dated 6 August 1974 and later
assumed the position beginning January, 1975 without objecting to the term
fixed for the new office up to October 31, 1975, said respondent abandoned his
old office and knowingly <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">accepted </span>the
new job with a fixed period. Petitioners' theory is flimsy, frivolous and
irrational for respondent would have thereby abandoned and given up his
security of tenure, a right already attained by him and fully protected by law.
We have ruled that the two positions, that of Medical Officer and Personnel
Health Officer, are one and the same, notwithstanding the increase in salary
from P100.00 to P200.00 a month which is inconsequential if not minimal. Since
the fixing of the term of office which was up to 31 October 1975 only is
clearly oppressive and arbitrary, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">same
</span>being in clear circumvention of the right of the respondent to be secure
in his employment, We hold and rule that respondent's tacit or implied
acceptance of the same is ineffective. Respondent's employment remains and is
deemed to be without a definite period.</p>

<p class="BODY">And considering that from year to year, for 25 years, respondent
continued to render the same kind of service without renewal or re-appointment
when all of a sudden, petitioners came up with the reorganization of the
hospital and converted respondent's employment to one with a definite period,
it becomes very obvious and apparent that the inten­tion of the petitioners in
providing for a fixed period is to "ease him out of the service"
because of the denunciation made by respondent against the management. The
injustice done to respondent is not difficult to see. After serving the
hospital for 25 years, he was unceremoniously replaced without any valid
reason. Nothing in the records discloses that respondent was found wanting in
the manner he exercised his duties or that his service was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, We find no abuse of discretion committed by respondent
NLRC.</p>
