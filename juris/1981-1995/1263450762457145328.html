<p class="BODY">The crucial issue in the case at bar is the identities of the
assailants who shot the victim, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, in his

</span>Both accused, however, stoutly denied the accusation against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution may be narrated in the following
recital, quoting the People's Brief, pp. 2-4, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 10:00 o'clock in the morning of February 26, 1969,
the appellant <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>
arrived at the house of the spouses Alfredo and Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>
in barrio <span class="SpellE">Agtipal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span>,
La Union, while it was being repaired (pp. 90, 91, 104, 161, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
helping in the work and drinking <span class="SpellE">basi</span> that was served
by <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> to the workers, at about <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">12:00 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time>,
<span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> left only to return at about <st1:time hour="13" minute="0">1:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of the same day
(pp. 105, 106, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long after <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
arrived, he had a quarrel with his brother Federico and <span class="GramE">they</span>
almost <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> each other had not the proverbial
cooler heads intervened to pacify them (pp. 106, 107, 108, 109, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they
had been pacified, <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> advised Federico to go home
to avoid further trouble (pp. l07, 108, 109, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
left, sore at her for sending his brother home, otherwise he would have killed
him (pp. 106, 108, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on he returned with his co-appellant
Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> (p. 106, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon seeing the two appellants, Alfredo, who was in the yard
talking with <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Delarna</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eniong</span> <span class="SpellE">Oredena</span>, told
his son <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> not to bring out <span class="SpellE">basi</span>
any­more because the 'drunks are here again,' referring to the appellants (pp.
83, 91, 92, 110, 148, 158, 169, 170, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.),
whereupon <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eniong</span>
left while father and son ascended their house for supper (pp. 82, 83, 148,
149, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Alfredo and his family were having supper, the appellants went up
to the house (pp. 83, 94, 152, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luis sat on the window sill east of the
dining table where the <span class="SpellE">Buccats</span> were eating, his feet
dangling out of the window, while <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> stood
beside him (pp. 83, 93, 152, 166, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A while thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span>, causing the
spouses to complain of the appellants' bad manners, especially at a time that
they were eating (pp. 84, 85, 152, 153, 157, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luis stood up and whis­pered something to <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> (pp. 84, 85, 153, 168, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards they left east­ward following the
pathway to their houses (pp. 85, 95, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Later on the appellants returned as the <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>
family had just finished supper and while in the yard at a distance of about
nine meters, appellant Luis fired several times at Alfredo from behind (pp. 75,
76, 78, 81, 95, 117, 118, 154, 155, 170, 173, 174, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo slumped and fell down to the floor
(pp. 97, 119, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> and her son <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> ran to the kitchen and screamed for help as they
saw the appellants fleeing northward (pp. 81, 96, 119, 156, 174, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The stricken victim was rushed to the <span class="SpellE">Lorma</span>
Hospital in San Fernando, La Union (p. 86, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.),
where he was attended to by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macagba</span>, Jr., director of the hospital (pp. 40, 41, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.), but expired at about 11:20 o'clock in the evening
due to severe loss of blood caused by the gun­shot wound sustained on the chest
(pp. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.; <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"F" and
"G")."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The principal witnesses for the prosecution are Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, the widow, and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, son of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony of the widow, lifted from the decision of the trial court,
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"MAGDALENA BUCCAT, widow of the deceased, testified that in
the evening of <st1:date month="2" day="26" year="1969">February 26, 1969</st1:date>,
she was at home and that right after supper with her deceased husband and their
two children <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> and Gloria, and an aunt of her
husband, they tarried awhile on the table where they ate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was on the cemented ground floor of
their two-storey house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While thus lingering after supper at <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">seven
 o'clock</st1:time> that evening she saw the accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>
with <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Del­mendo</span>
at their yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she saw Luis fire at
her husband who, upon being hit, collapsed to the floor from the chair where he
was seated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately she ran for help
towards the kitchen door where she again saw accused Luis and <span class="SpellE">FLorentino</span> running towards the north.</blockquote>

<blockquote>She did not know who finally brought her husband to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lorma</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
at <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union, but when
she followed to the hos­pital at <st1:time hour="10" minute="0">10 o'clock</st1:time>
that evening her husband was already dead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On cross-examination, she disclosed that that same night a
policeman by the name of <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> came to
investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She admitted that she did
not tell anyone who the assailant of her husband was except to her son <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> who likewise saw the assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she said it was probable that she told
policeman <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also admitted that she advised her son <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> not to tell anyone as yet who the assailant was
because, according to her, she was still afraid 'they might come back for us!'
Asked the distance between the <span class="GramE">assailant</span> to her husband
when shot, she dis­closed that the assailant was about six meters (nine meters
by actual measurement).</blockquote>

<blockquote>That she recognized Luis fire at that distance as he was
illuminated by the kero­sene lamp near the window and that it was a clear night
with the moon shining at <st1:time hour="13" minute="0">one o'clock</st1:time>
high."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The material testimony of the son <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
is like­wise recited in the trial court's decision, and <span class="GramE">We</span>
quote:</p>

<blockquote>"ELPIDIO BUCCAT, l9, son of the victim, testified that x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> family had finished
their supper, the victim rested for a while on the same chair by the dining
table but had changed his original sitting position such that his back was
turned against the dining table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness
on the other hand remained seated by the table facing west in his original
position now tinkering with the picture frame.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was reaching for the picture frame when he saw both accused suddenly
appear at the western window of the dining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>
aim and fire at his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this
precise moment, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> was about one meter behind
Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the gun fired, witness ran to the kitchen and out of the house to
report the shooting to a neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Marquez.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Witness <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>
did not reveal the identities of the assailants of his father that same night
except to his mother who advised him not to reveal their identi­ties yet to
anybody for fear of reprisal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Corporal Modesto <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span> Police Force was the first police authority who,
upon learning of the incident about <st1:time hour="8" minute="0">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
that evening, proceeded immediately to the scene at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Agtipal</span>
with Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Partible</span> and two enlisted PC men
assigned to <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also quote hereunder Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Espejo's</span>
testimony as cited in the decision:</p>

at <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city> by men from barrio <span class="SpellE">Agtipal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
interrogated the widow and their son and one <span class="SpellE">Tinoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> (He was not sure of the surname), but did not
reduce them in writing because he turned over the investigation to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> Marquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
gathered by his routine police investigation that same evening that the
deceased was shot in his house at barrio <span class="SpellE">Agtipal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recovered six empty shells west of the
house on the ground under the window, and a slug inside the house em­bedded in
a window frame east of the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Later he made a verbal report to the chief of police to whom he
also turned over the six empty shells (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) and
one slug (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At</span> the municipal building a guard
informed him that the suspects were also at the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He transmitted the information to Pat. <span class="GramE">Marquez who was then at the hospital."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution further show that the accused
Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> were subjected to paraffin tests at the
Provincial Constabulary Headquarters in San Fernando, La Union where they were

<p class="BODY">Testifying for the defense, <span class="SpellE">Revelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balen</span>, the barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Agtipal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span>, La Union, declared that between the hours
of <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7:00</st1:time> and <st1:time hour="8" minute="0">8:00</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date month="2" day="26" year="1969">February 26, 1969</st1:date> he was working in his flue-curing barn
in <span class="SpellE">Agtipal</span> when he heard gun reports from a northerly
direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded northward to
investigate the cause of the gunfire when he met children who were running
southward and reporting, "<span class="SpellE">Tata</span> <span class="SpellE">Pidong</span> was shot." He then proceeded to the house of
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, the victim, and found his bleeding
body inside the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were many
people near the crime scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called
for a tri­cycle to bring the victim to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lorma</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
he asked the victim who shot him, but the latter answered "I do not
know." He saw both accused at the hospital but did not know their purpose
in going there.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span>, barrio councilman of <span class="SpellE">Agtipal</span>, also testified for the defense, saying that
between <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7:00</st1:time> and <st1:time hour="20" minute="0">8:00 p.m.</st1:time> on the date of the incident, he heard gun
reports and when he heard the sound of a horn giving the alarm, he proceeded to
the house of the victim which was rumored to be the source of the gun
reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came upon the victim loaded
into a tricycle for the purpose of rushing him to a hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He also stated that he inquired from </u><st1:place><u>Magdalena</u></st1:place><u>
<span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> and her son <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> if they knew the assailants and they replied in the
nega­tive</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
where the assailant was at the time he fired at the victim and <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
pointed to the southeastern part of her house saying, "That is the place
where the flash of light came from." <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span>
also dec­lared that he searched for evidence particularly empty shells to help
authorities solve the crime but he could not find any at the place pointed to
by the widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, found six
empty shells about a meter below the window west of the house and he covered
them with a wash basin to avoid them being touched by anyone.</p>

<p class="BODY">This witness further testified that he campaigned for
blood-donors willing to give their blood for the victim, and two <span class="SpellE">caretela</span> loads of people responded to the request for
blood, he accompanying them up to the national road where they were later on
transported to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lorma</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> where the victim was
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that both accused,
Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>, were among those who volunteered to donate
their blood to the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fact of the blood donation given by the accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>, the records disclosed that in truth and in fact,
said accused donated 250 cc. of his blood type "B" to the victim,
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, on <st1:date month="2" day="26" year="1969">February 26, 1969</st1:date> as shown in the certificate issued by
Nora <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>, medical technologist of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lorma</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"1").</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in convicting the two accused, reached such
conclusion on the following rationale:</p>

<blockquote>"That Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> fired the gun
that killed the deceased; that <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> was near and in company with Luis; and that both
of them were positively identified by the witnesses Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, the court has no valid reason to doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a distance of about nine meters at night
one can easily be identified by the light of a kerosene lamp (such as that used
by the family of the deceased) espe­cially if the party is well-known to the
identifier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the accused and the
witnesses are <span class="SpellE">barriomates</span> and are well known to each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the identity of Luis
as the gun wielder was corroborated by the findings of Col. <span class="SpellE">Minardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fiñones</span>, chief of the P.C. Central Laboratory showing
that Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> was positive for powder burns.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The testimonies of <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>, even if they are the widow and son, respec­tively,
of the deceased corroborate each other in all respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have been shown not to be perjured and
no motive or reason was ever faintly suggested why they will perjure their
testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the accused himself
admitted that before the in­cident, they were in the best of terms with the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from these, the testi­mony
of <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> of
the shooting as well as the place where Luis fired from was further
substantiated by the testimony of police Corporal Modesto <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>
who tes­tified that he recovered six empty shells thereat plus a slug embedded
on the frame of the eastern window of the ground floor of the victim's
house." <span class="GramE">(Decision, pp. 21-­22; Records, pp. 185-186).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Assailing the above decision, the main thrust of the defense is
that the testimonies of the widow, <st1:place>Magda­lena</st1:place>, and her
son, <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>, relative to the identity of the
malefactors cannot be believed and relied upon be­cause there are compelling
reasons why their declarations cannot be given full faith and credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And these are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="GramE">The</span> three
kerosene lamps were all inside the house as testified to by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have
been dark outside considering that it was already bet­ween 7:00 and 8:00
o'clock in the evening, hence, it was quite difficult for her to recognize
persons outside of her house at the time of the incident; (2) While she
testified that she saw one of the malefactors aim his gun to her husband, she
did not even warn her husband of the danger to his life; she did not shout a
warning at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an unnatural
behavior of a wife witnes­sing the danger to her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had she really seen the accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> aim his gun at the deceased husband of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, the latter would have certainly shouted a warning
to him as a natural and instinctive reaction; (3) Her testimony on
cross-examination that despite the time of the night (between 7:00 to 8:00
o'clock) she was even able to recognize the color of the shirts of the
appellants, i.e., Luis was wearing light brown shirt while <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
was wearing a red­dish shirt (p. 136, TSN, October 16, 1969), are exag­gerations
in an attempt to appear credible, only to unmask her incredibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unbelievable to recog­nize with
accuracy the color of a shirt at that time of the night especially when the
color of the shirt is dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is next
to impossible since any colored object on a dark night without the aid of
artificial light would appear to be black to the naked eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the alleged assailants were some
nine meters away from the victim (p. 7, Decision) and therefore even further
away from Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>, an accurate identification
cannot be relied upon; (4) When Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> was
investigated by the police immediately after the shooting, she did not mention
the names of the assailants of her husband to the police investigator, her
reason being:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I did not then
mention because I was then crying." <span class="GramE">(p. 139, TSN, Oct.
16, 1969).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense argues
that her reason for not divulging the assailants of her husband on the night
she was investigated is flimsy for even if she was crying, it was easy for her
to mention the names of the assailants, but she did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been more natural for her to
mention the names of the assail­ants in the course of her investigation even if
not asked or prodded to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only on <st1:date month="3" day="14" year="1969">March 14, 1969</st1:date>, or
more than two weeks after the incident, that she divulged the names of her
husband's assailants allegedly because it was only then that she "had com­posed"
herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, she testified:</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense considers the foregoing testimony as valueless for
two reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, because on the night
of the incident immediately after his father was shot, the police investigators
were already in their house conducting an on-the-spot investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he could have informed them of the

authorities is a lie because the body of the deceased was brought to the
hospital on the same night of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">The defense maintains that the trial court erred in concluding
that "the identity of Luis as the gun wielder was corroborated by the
findings of Col. <span class="SpellE">Minardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fiñones</span>,
Chief of the P.C. Central Laboratory, showing that Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>
was positive for powder burns." <span class="GramE">(p. 21, Decision).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that the findings of the
laboratory that both hands of Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> were
positive for powder burns is not conclusive that he fired the gun in the light
of the admission of Col. <span class="SpellE">Fiñones</span> that there is such a
thing as "false negative," that is if he did not fire a gun but found
positive for nitrates (p. 10, TSN, Sept. 23, 1969); that it is possible that a
person who did not fire a gun could be found positive for powder burns; that
"even a mere handling, for one occasion, of fertilizer could produce
nitrates on one's hand" (pp. 11-12, TSN, Sept. 23, 1969).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, Col. <span class="SpellE">Fiñones</span>
admit­ted that (1) one who works in a laboratory and handles nitrates will have
nitrates in his hands (p. 7, TSN, Sept. 23, 1969); (2) even smoking could
produce nitrates (p. 11, Id.); (3) even urinating also produces nitrates (p.
11, Id.); and (4) handling of fertilizer also pro­duces nitrates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 13, Id.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense further contends that although Col. <span class="SpellE">Fiñones</span> testified that nitrates from gun powder is fine and
thin, whereas other nitrates give lighter color and bigger smell, he admitted
that this is not conclusive (p. 12, TSN, Sept. 23, 1969).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that although thin and fine
nitrates were found in the hands of Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>,
such fact is not conclusive that he fired a gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>
was at the time of the incident an employee of the Filipinas Magnetite
Corporation, FILMAG for short, working under Engineer Daniel P. <span class="SpellE">Cafuir</span>, Chemical Engineer, in the Assay Department of said
firm (pp. 330-331, TSN, March 5, 1970).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Luis was then a laboratory technician in said firm, assisting the firm's
chemist in "the analysis of elements, iron concentrate and copper
ores"; that he used to handle chemicals and although he was equipped with
gloves to prevent him from contamination, he had been working without gloves,
reason for which the firm used to reprimand him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 332, TSN, Id.)</span>
Engineer <span class="SpellE">Cafuir</span> likewise declared that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The chemicals most often used in the

<p class="BODY">In convicting the two accused for the murder of the victim in
this case, the conviction must be based on evidence that is clear, positive and
strong creating a moral certainty as to the guilt of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge against them must be proved beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the two alleged
eyewitnesses to the commission of the crime are the widow and son of the
victim, their testimonies pointing to the accused as the perpe­trators must be
subjected to a rigid test which should demonstrate beyond cavil their
truthfulness, honesty and rectitude as actual eyewitnesses to the perpetration
of the criminal act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must never be
any shadow of doubt, any cloud of suspicion or deception to conceal the facts
and disguise the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first, if
not the basic foundation upon which the prosecution builds its case against the
accused is proof beyond reason­able doubt that it is the said accused who
committed the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the identity of the accused is the first duty of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier indicated, the widow, <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>,
and her son, <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>, both point the accusing finger
to the two accused as the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, the evidence clearly show that it took them 16 days after the
commission of the crime to lay the blame upon both accused for the first time
when on March 14, 1969, these alleged eye­witnesses went to the police
department in the <span class="SpellE">townhall</span> to make their written
statements and accuse the two defendants, although police investigators (one of
them the police sergeant who was their close relative) had gone to the house of
the victim and the witnesses to conduct an on-the-spot investigation that very
night when the shooting occurred on February 26, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The credibility of their testimonies <span class="GramE">are</span>, therefore, seriously attacked.</p>

she would have immediately and spontaneous­ly revealed his identity upon
reporting the crime as would be expected according to the natural course of

arrested until <st1:date month="5" day="3" year="1959">May 3, 1959</st1:date>

- Did <span class="SpellE">Her­minio</span> Marquez ask you the identity of the
persons who shot your father when you came to him?" <span class="SpellE">Elpidio's</span>
answer was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A - No, sir."
Then followed this question: "Q - And you did not volunteer to tell
him?" <span class="GramE">"A - No, sir."</span> <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 177, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 23, 1969</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">This failure of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> to inform even
their neigh­bor <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Marquez, who is also a
second cousin of his father, being the brother of police investigator Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> Marquez, which would have been a very logical and
natural particular to disclose in <span class="SpellE">Elpidio's</span> report or
account of what had happened to his father as stated by him to <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> as the former sought for help, must cast grave
doubts as to the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio's</span> testimony
that he saw and identified the two accused as the assailants of his father.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>, the lapse of 16 days during which time <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> did not go to the police to give their
statements or affidavits also engenders grave doubts that the two alleged
eyewitnesses actually saw the two accused in the act of shooting the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Claiming that they
volunteered to go to the <span class="SpellE">Presidencia</span> to be
investigated in connection with the incident and that they were not summoned.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> explained
that after the incident she had not yet composed herself and it was only on <st1:date month="3" day="14" year="1969">March 14, 1969</st1:date> that she had composed
herself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such explanation or reason is weak, if not sham, considering that
the usual mourning period had already elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She may be the aggrieved widow but certainly, her grief cannot be so
protracted as to be neglectful to seek immediate justice with the help of the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the witnesses
procrastinated or delayed in going to the police authorities strongly indicates
the con­clusion that they did not actually see the assailants or they were not
sure and positive as to their identi­ties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fourth</u>, the circumstances of time and place further
engender serious misgivings that the two eyewitnesses, <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>, clearly saw the faces of the
assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time of the shooting was
between <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7:00</st1:time> and <st1:time hour="8" minute="0">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date month="2" day="26" year="1969">February 26, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three (3) small kerosene lamps were lighted
because it was already <span class="GramE">nighttime</span> and supper had
already been partaken by the <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two alleged eyewitnesses were inside the
house, on the ground floor and without any premonition whatsoever of the coming
danger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailants were outside the
house, some nine meters away from the place where <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She declared that she saw the
assailants only through the window, the di­mensions being 1 meter and 33 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be true
that the moon was shining at one o'clock position and it was only a half-moon,
but considering the distance and the conditions of the night, common experience
show that it would be physically difficult to immediately accustom the eyes to
an object, more so a person, standing outside in the premises of the yard.</p>

<p class="BODY">That <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> could identify the color of
the assailants' shirts and that <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> could
identify the color of their pants which must have been hidden by the lower
portion of the window through which they were sighted, appears to be an
exaggeration, if not imagi­nation to lend credence to their
identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These and other details
which the witnesses recalled and what each did after the shooting to prove
their memory do not, however, impress <span class="GramE">Us</span> in the face
of the indisputable fact that the witnesses delayed unreasonably in accusing
the two assailants to the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records further show the lackadaisical action of the police
in apprehending and arresting the perpetrators.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Cpl. Modesto <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> with Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Partible</span> and 2 P.C. soldiers repaired to the scene of the
shooting right after the incident, no attempt was made to locate, search or
recover the firearm used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> said he investigated the widow and the son (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 27, Hearing of Sept. 23, 1969) although <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>, the son, said he was not investigated by Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 180, Hearing
of Oct, 10, 1969) but <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> did not take their
statements in writing that night, or even after several days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not follow up his investigation
because he rested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 31, <st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1969">Sept. 23, 1969</st1:date>) and

investigation as to who shot the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">And Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> Marquez, a second
cousin of the victim who took over the investigation from Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>, did not interview the widow allegedly because she

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the deceased had referred to the accused as
"drunks", assuming that <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> was sore

remarked about the bad manners of the two accused when <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">vomitted</span>, are these sufficient motives or reasons for
the accused to murder the deceased, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold and rule that tested by the common
experience and observation of mankind, the said evi­dence falls short, far and
below that degree of probability logically and reasonably acceptable under the
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For certainly, the role
of Magdalena as a peacemaker bet­ween the fighting brothers, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> and Federico <span class="SpellE">Del­mendo</span>,
was a good deed which normally deserves another in return, and not an act of
murder of the husband who was not even present during the quarrel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does the remark ut­tered by Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> referring to the two accused as "drunks"
sufficiently prove the reason for the shooting, much less the comment on their
bad manners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the insufficiency
of the motive, nay its improbability by normal standards, weakens the
prosecution's identification of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, it strengthens the defense claim that the accused were not the
assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last point is the defense of alibi set up by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi is a weak defense that
cannot prevail over positive identification of the accused by eye­witnesses
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Estrocada</span>, 75 SCRA 295; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Roncal</span>, 79 SCRA 509).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alibi assumes importance where evidence for prosecution is weak and
betrays lack of concreteness on question of whether or not the accused
committed the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An accused
cannot be con­victed on the basis of evidence which, independently of his
alibi, is weak, uncorroborated, and inconclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily
proven was never intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases;
otherwise, there would be the absurdity of an accused being put in a more
difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than
where it is strong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People

that an accused can avail of, it acquires commensurate strength where no
positive and proper identification has been made by the witnesses of the
offender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution has the <u>onus</u>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above jurisprudential rules to the case at bar, it
is at once discernible that the alibi of the two accused is so simple in their
candidness in admitting that each of them were in their respective houses which
are very near to the scene of the crime at the time of the shooting of the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house of the accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> is about 200 meters from the house of the victim (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 413, hearing on March 5, 1970) and he (the
accused) was about to eat his supper when he heard the gun volleys (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 394, hearing, March 5, 1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with respect to the other accused <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>, his house is
about 50 meters away from the house of Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 310, hearing, March 4, 1970) and said
accused was in the street north of his house when he came to know for the first
time that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> was shot (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 319, hearing, March 4, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">The above alibi is positively corroborated by wit­ness <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Almodovar</span> who declared
that he, together with the two accused, drank gin and coca-cola in the store of
Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> that afternoon of February 26, 1969;
that they walked to the house of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> where
<span class="SpellE">Almodovar</span> stayed behind while the two accused
proceeded to the house of Barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Revelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balen</span>; that after 30 minutes, he saw the two accused leave
the house, going northwards, after which he heard gun explosions, a successive
volley of fires coming from the west.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 259-263, </span><st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 4, 1970</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> hearing).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the defense of alibi frequently deserves little
consideration because it is easily fabricated, it is not always false and
without merit (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pulmones</span>, 61 Phil. 680) as
in the case at hand, and when coupled with the improbabilities and
uncertainties of the prosecution evidence, suffice to raise reasonable doubt as
to their responsibility (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>, 42 SCRA
1).</p>

<p class="BODY">We have already ruled herein that the prosecution has not
presented clear, positive and convincing evidence identifying the two accused
as the actual assailants or perpetrators of the shooting of the victim, Alfredo
<span class="SpellE">Buccat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
basis of Our ruling have been laid down and explained and the inevitable
end-result is that We must acquit the two accused not because their defense of
alibi is weak, although such defense has acquired commensurate strength due to
failure of positive and proper identification of the offenders by the
witnesses, but on the ground that the prosecution has failed to discharge its
responsibility of proving their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For indeed, the duty of the prosecution to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond peradventure of doubt is a primary one,
and until and unless such duty has been performed, the constitutional
presumption of innocence to which the accused is entitled must be upheld,
whether his defense of alibi is weak or strong.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the prosecution is not required to submit such a degree of
proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty but only
moral certainty is required, or that degree of proof which produces convic­tion
in an unprejudiced mind (Rule 133, Sec. 2, Rules of Court), in the case at bar,
We are confronted with <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts and
circumstances which are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is
consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with
their guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a situation, as
held by the Supreme Court in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Abana</span>, 76
Phil. 1; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, 47 Phil, 48, 57; People
vs. Bautista, 81 Phil. 78; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span>,
L-24804, July 5, 1968, 25 SCRA 3, the evidence does not fulfill the test of
moral certainty and is not sufficient to support a conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have analyzed and weighed the whole proof of the case at hand,
the totality of all the facts and circums­tances presented before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, and after such careful ana­lysis, review and
appraisal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find inability to let the
mind rest easy upon the moral certainty of their guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Gallora</span></u>,
L-21740, <st1:date month="10" day="30" year="1969">Oct. 30, 1969</st1:date>, 29
SCRA 780, 786, where the circumstances are in some respects similar to the
present case, the Supreme Court, speaking thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The corroborated alibi of appellant; the fact that he did not
hesitate to go with the municipal authorities to the scene of the crime; the
failure of the two material witnesses for the prosecution to identify him when
identification would have been most timely and in accord with natural human
reaction; the absence of evidence concern­ing motivation; and the finding of
the telltale handkerchief in the possession of ano­ther person - all these
circumstances cannot but cast a grave doubt as to the guilt of appellant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the impartial and unbiased mind is not laid to rest easy
upon the moral certainty of the accused being guilty in the light of the very
singular fact that both accused, Luis and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>,
immediately volunteered to be blood donors to save the life of the victim,
Alfredo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very evidence of the
prosecution show that both ac­cused joined and rode with other volunteers in
two <span class="SpellE"><u>caretelas</u></span> to the town and then took a
Thames transportation jitney to San Fernando town at the <span class="SpellE">Lorma</span>
Hospital and there, Luis was tested as to the suitability of his blood type and
accordingly, gave 250 cc. of his life blood, type "B" to the victim,
which is attested by the certification of the Medical Technician, Nora <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>, in Exhibit "1".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the accused Luis, he donated
blood because Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Buccat</span> was his uncle, the
latter being a second cousin of Luis' father, and he had no misunderstanding
with his uncle.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's holding that this sacrifice of blood donation
made by the accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span> was pos­sibly a manifestation
of remorse on the part of the accused after their drunken state had subsided,
is clearly a distortion for a drunken person cannot be accepted for blood
transfusion or donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, to
hold that possibly the accused went with the crowd to the hospital to hide
their responsibility for the crime is purely conjectural and speculative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records do not disclose any reasonable
basis, not an iota of proof for such a conclusion arrived at by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the P.C. findings in Exhibit "C" that the dorsal
portion of both hands of the accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>
was found positive for gunpowder residue (nitrates), the same is, to Our mind,
satisfactorily explained by the testimony of Luis who at the time was employed
with Filipinas Magnetite Corporation (FILMAG) and his work was assisting the
chemists in assaying or analyzing iron concentrates and copper ore from the
black sands <span class="SpellE">dugged</span> out by FILMAG, using his hands,
sometimes with gloves and other times without gloves, causing yellowish discolora­tion
on the palm, fingers, fingertips and dorsal portion of both hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The work involved the handling and mixing of
chemicals such as ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate and other
reagents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of Luis' work as a
laboratory technician is corroborated by his immediate superior, Chemical
Engineer Daniel P. <span class="SpellE">Cafuir</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the <span class="GramE">presence of gunpowder residue
(nitrates) on both hands of the accused Luis do</span> not conclusively prove
that he had recently fired a gun is admitted by the P.C. expert, Col. <span class="SpellE">Minardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fiñones</span>, who testified
also for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most
significant testimony of Col. <span class="SpellE">Fiñones</span> is that there
is no difference in size between gunpowder residue and one caused by constant
handling of chemicals (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 359, March 5, 1970
Hearing) and that the continued handling of chemicals containing nitrates,
potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate and ammonium nitrate will give characteristic
color of blue specks on a person handling said chemicals (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 362, March 5, 1970 Hearing); and that one who fired a gun may give a
negative result and also one who did not actually fire a gun is negative for
paraffin test be­cause according to him, "there is a false positive and a
false negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>False negative is when
he fired a gun and is negative for paraffin test; and false positive when he

<p class="BODY">In resume, where the evidence clearly and convin­cingly show that
(1) the material witnesses of the pro­secution, the widow and son of the
deceased, failed to reveal and identify the assailants to the police and P.C.
authorities at the earliest opportunity when they arrived to investigate the
shooting soon thereafter, not even to the police sergeant, a close relative of
the aggrieved family, who followed up the investigation; (2) that the son,
reporting to and seeking help from an uncle living only 10 meters away from the
scene of the crime, did not also disclose the assailants' identities; (3) that
both material witnesses delayed unreasonably for 16 days after the shooting to
go to the police department and make their sworn statement naming the two
accused as the per­petrators; (4) that the circumstances of time (between 7:00
and 8:00 o'clock in the evening), of place (witnesses are under the house in
the ground floor and looking through a small window out to the yard of the
house lo­cated in the barrio), and of distance (9 meters away) render accurate
identification of perpetrators in a sud­den and startling <span class="SpellE">occurence</span>,
difficult and unreliable; (5) the police made no effort to locate and search
for the fatal weapon nor place in the police blotter the names of the suspects;
(6) that the motive shown was flimsy, inoffensive and trivial, hence insufficient;
and (7) both accused volunteered to donate their blood to the victim and in
fact, one gave 250 cc. of his blood, type "B" to save him, the guilt
of the two accused has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt, thus they are
entitled to acquittal of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision appealed
from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two accused are hereby ACQUITTED and they are ordered released and
set free immediately, unless they are other­wise detained for some other lawful
cause.</p>
