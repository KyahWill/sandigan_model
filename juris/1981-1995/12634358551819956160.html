				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On August 10, 1990, the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) rendered a decision in POEA Case No. (L) 88-07-595
entitled Arthur Pangan v. Philippine Manpower Services, Inc. and Adawliah
Universal Electronics and Afisco Insurance Corporation, disposing as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
ordering respondent Philippine Manpower Service Corporation, jointly and
severally with its principal Adawliah Universal Electronics, to pay complainant
Arthur F. Pangan the following amounts:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE
HUNDRED FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (US$11,550.), representing his salaries for the

counterclaims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Payment of the above awards shall be made in Philippine Currency at
the prevailing rate of exchange at the time of payment.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Petitioners herein appealed said POEA decision before public
respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).  The NLRC, in its Resolution of March 4,
1991, modified the decision of the POEA but only insofar as it corrected the
POEA on the proper rate of exchange to be applied in converting the award of
US$11,550.00 to its equivalent in Philippine currency.  It thus held:</p>

<blockquote>“However, while we are convinced that because Pangan was illegally
dismissed, he should be paid the salaries corresponding to the unexpired
portion of his contract, we believe that because of the erratic devaluation of
the Philippine Peso vis-a-vis, the US Dollars, simple fairness dictates that
the payment of the awards in Philippine Currency should not be 'at the rate of
exchange at the time of payment,' as mandated by the POEA, but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">rather at </span>the rate of exchange
prevailing at the time the complainant's cause of action accrue or at the time
he was illegally dismissed on 21 July 1988.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Consequently, said resolution disposed as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, subject to the modification above-stated, the
decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby, AFFIRMED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED. ”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of NLRC's Resolution of March 4,
1991 was denied in its Resolution of April 24, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a final recourse, petitioners filed the instant petition for
annulment of the NLRC's Resolutions of March 4, 1991 and April 24, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged dismissal without cause of private respondent Arthur
F. Pangan by his employer Adawliah Union Electronics and Afisco Insurance
Corporation (Adawliah, for short) based in Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia, spawned the
present controversy.  Pangan filed with
the POEA, a case for illegal dismissal, underpayment of overtime pay,
separation pay, actual damages representing his salaries for the unexpired
portion of his contract of employment, and exemplary damages of US$10,000.00
plus attorney's fees.  His complaint
alleged that he entered into a two-year contract of employment with Adawliah,
as a data entry clerk technician for US$550.00 a month, commencing on April 30,
1988.  He complained that he rendered
overtime work of fourteen (14) hours last May 1988 and another twenty-four (24)
hours in June 1988 without having received any compensation therefor; worse, he
was ordered to work as programmer in addition to his work as data entry clerk
technician without any offer to correspondingly increase his salary; that
Pangan's demand for salary adjustment irked Mr. Ahmed Yosul, Administrative
Manager of Adawliah, who thus ordered Pangan's termination on grounds of
incompetence.  Pangan was consequently
compelled to accept payment of only US389.00 dollars, covering his services for
July 1-21.  All other claims were waived
by him after he was threatened to be jailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Philippine Manpower Services, Inc. (Philman) denied
Pangan's allegations in his complaint.  Philman justified Pangan's termination as a valid exercise by his
employer Adawliah, of its management prerogative to fire employees who proved
to be incompetent while still under probation.  It thus prayed for the dismissal of the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The POEA, however, found Pangan's complaint meritorious.  Though it recognized the management
prerogative to select its employees, it nevertheless ruled that the exercise
thereof is not without any qualification.  The POEA explained that probationary employees can only be dismissed for
just cause duly proved.  In the case at
bar, it found that there was no justified dismissal of complainant Pangan for
failure of Adawliah to substantiate its claim of his unsatisfactory
performance.  General averments on
Pangan's incompetence do not constitute just cause to warrant his termination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Philman and Adawliah were thus ordered to pay <u>in</u> <u>solidum</u>,
the equivalent in Philippine currency of US$11,550.00 representing Pangan's
salary for the unexpired portion of his contract and attorney's fees amounting
to five percent (5%) of said award.  The
POEA further ruled that in paying the above award in Philippine currency, the
conversion rate to be used shall be that prevailing at the time of payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Philman and Adawliah sought a reversal of said POEA ruling by
appealing before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).  As aforementioned, the NLRC affirmed, with
modification, the POEA ruling appealed from, in its Resolution of March 4,
1991.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Philman and Adawliah moved for reconsideration of the Resolution
of March 4, 1991 but were denied by the NLRC for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the instant petition was filed by Philman and
Adawliah claiming that:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">“I</p>

<blockquote>With grave abuse of discretion, the Honorable Commission (Second
Division) together with POEA Administrator Jose N. Sarmiento brushed aside
petitioners-appellants submission that complainant-appellee was lawfully
dismissed in accordance with his contract of employment and in consonance with
previous POEA and NLRC rulings applicable to the case at bar.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

<blockquote>With grave abuse of discretion, the Honorable Commission (Second
Division) disregarded appellant's contention based on Article 281 of the Labor
Code of the Philippines, that workers on probation or trial acquire only
transitional rights to the fulfillment of their employment contracts and
therefore the complainant-appellee cannot lawfully be entitled to payment of
salary for the period of 21 months after failing to qualify as a regular
employee during his three months' trial period.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

<blockquote>The Honorable Commission (Second Division) gravely erred in holding
that appellee's dismissal is sustained by the Supreme Court ruling in Manila
Hotel vs. NLRC, 141 SCRA 169.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">IV</p>

<blockquote>With grave abuse of discretion, the Honorable Commission (Second

the dismissal of the complainant-appellee was capricious.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Philman and Adawliah insist that during the probationary period,
the employer is acting within his rights in dismissing his employee who failed
to meet the qualification standard for continued employment.  Moreover, they aver that Pangan's inability
to satisfy the standards set by Adawliah amounts to incompetence which is a
just cause for termination of his services pursuant to the first paragraph of
the contract of employment executed between Adawliah and Pangan, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"If during the first three (3) months (probation period) of
employment, the EMPLOYER find the EMPLOYEE to be incompetent or incapable of
performing the type of work for which he was hired, then the EMPLOYER may
discharge the EMPLOYEE for cause with no obligation on the part of the EMPLOYER
except for payment of accrued pay up to the time of termination.  The payment of economy class air
transportation back to the point of hire shall be for the account of
EMPLOYEE."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing, they argued that the determination
of whether Pangan is capable of performing the duties of Data Entry Clerk
Technician rests solely with Adawliah, his employer, who is in the best
position to observe Pangan's performance during the probationary period.  There is thus no necessity, contrary to the
views of the POEA and NLRC, to cite specific incidents of Pangan's incompetence
in order to prove the legality of the dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Philman and Adawliah further maintained that as a result of
Pangan's failure to qualify as a regular employee, he did not acquire any
rights whatsoever to work out the full term of his employment contract.  Accordingly, they concluded that Pangan is
not entitled to an award equivalent to the unexpired portion of his two-year
employment contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment to the petition, the Solicitor General considers
petitioners' arguments as untenable.  He
contends that, notwithstanding Pangan's probationary status, he nonetheless
enjoys the constitutional protection on security of tenure unless just cause
exists to justify his termination.  He
further stressed that the prerogative of management to dismiss Pangan must be
exercised without abuse of discretion.  The absence of sufficient evidence to substantiate Pangan's dismissal
and the lack of specific acts or instances to show Pangan's lackluster performance
negates the claim of Adawliah that the dismissal was a rightful exercise of
such prerogative.  Due to the gross
violation of Pangan's security of tenure, the Solicitor General opined that he
is entitled to an award equivalent to his salary for the unexpired portion of
his two-year employment contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition should be dismissed.  Jurisprudence is rich in cases guaranteeing the security of
tenure, limited though it may be, of probationary employees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Except for just cause as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">provided by law
or under the employment contract, a </span>probationary employee cannot he
terminated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners do not view Pangan's termination as a violation of these legal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">precepts.  Rather, they consider his incompetence as a just </span>cause,
sufficient to constitute the basis of his dismissal under the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">At first blush,
petitioners' position may seem </span>sound, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">it appearing that their contract, which is the law between them, </span>contains
a stipulation that the employer has the discretion to dismiss its employees for
incompetence.  However, where the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">dismissed employee, Pangan in this instance,
challenges his </span>dismissal as illegal, predicating his claim on the
absence of a just cause, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>correct
issue is not so much Adawliah's discretion to terminate as the existence of
Pangan's alleged incompetence as ground for his termination.  Hence, the POEA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">and NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in requiring
petitioners to present proof of the alleged incompetence of Pangan.  Thus, it has been held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“It is a basic principle in the dismissal of employees that the burden
of proof rests upon the employer to show that the dismissal of the employee is
for a just cause, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">failure </span>to
do so would necessarily mean that the dismissal is not justified [Polymedic

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">This same principle

ground that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

substantiate the cause of private respondent's dismissal, but likewise failed

performance."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">no </span>convincing proof establishing
Pangan's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">alleged incompetence was
presented.  The POEA and NLRC,
therefore, correctly declared the dismissal to be illegal.  Pangan's dismissal without cause during the
probationary period constitutes a violation of his Constitutional right to
security of tenure.  The Constitution,
which is built into all contracts </span>entered into in the Philippines and
governed by Philippine law when it provides in Art. XIII, Sec. 3<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that "they shall be entitled to security of tenure..." did not
distinguish between probationary and regular employees.  Consequently, Pangan deserves the disputed
award of the POEA, entitling him to an amount representing his salary for the
unexpired portion of his employment contract.  It was erroneous for petitioners to question the award as improper,
theorizing that he is not entitled to a sum equivalent to his salary for the
unexpired portion of the contract, he being merely a probationary employee who
has not acquired a vested right to demand fulfillment of his employment
contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, petitioners have misread the statutory grant of
security of tenure to probationary employees.  Under Article 281 of the Labor Code,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> a

employee in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to

to prove either ground <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>a
basis for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">terminating Pangan's
employment, no reason exists to sever the employment relationship between
Adawliah and Pangan.  Otherwise stated,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VITUG, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">I fully concur
with the opinion so well presented and written, once again, by Mme. Justice
Flerida Ruth P. Romero.  I cannot,
however, let the opportunity pass without expressing my own views on the
conversion rate that should be used in the payment of foreign exchange
obligations covered by the provisions of Republic Act No. 529, as amended by
Republic Act No. 4100.  Since the
promulgation of the decision in <u>Kalalo</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Luz</u> on 31 July
1970, other cases were decided by the Court.  Lately, in <u>General</u> <u>Insurance</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Surety</u> <u>Corporations</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Union</u> <u>Insurance</u> <u>Society</u> </span><u>of</u> <u>Canton,</u>
<u>Ltd.</u> (G.R. Nos. 30475-76, elaborated in San Buenaventura v. Court of
Appeals, 181 SCRA 197 [1990]), the Court, in sum held:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the obligation was incurred prior to the
enactment of Republic Act No. 529 and required payment in a particular kind of
coin or currency other than the Philippine currency, the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">should be discharged in Philippine
currency at the prevailing rate of exchange at the time the obligation was
incurred, except in case of a loan made in a foreign currency in which event
the rate of exchange prevailing at the stipulated date of payment should
prevail.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If, however, the obligation is incurred
after the enactment of Republic Act No. 529, the provision of the law which
require payment at the prevailing rate of exchange when the obligation is
incurred cannot be applied.  Republic
Act No. 529 does not provide for the payment of obligation after the enactment
of the said Act.  Logically, therefore,
the rate of exchange shall be that prevailing at the time of payment rather
than on the date of incurrence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Concededly,
Republic Act No. 529 has left some gaps on its proper application.  While it did fail to provide for the payment
of obligations incurred after its effectivity, it indeed seems logical to
conclude that the law meant to apply the rate of exchange prevailing at the
time of payment but I believe, only to obligations incurred in, or based on,
foreign currency.  This view is just and
fair in that it maintains and preserves the real value of the foreign
exchange-incurred obligation to the date of its payment.  When, however, the obligation is incurred in
Philippine currency, there should be no need for the law to still make any
reference to any rate of exchange or to a measure of value in foreign currency
in its payment.  The obligation should
instead be then understood to be payable in the same amount of Philippine
currency conformably with Article 1250 of the Civil Code.  Under this provision, an adjustment in value
can only be made in the event of an extraordinary inflation or deflation and
only if the parties did not stipulate against such </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">adjustment.  To assume otherwise would be to defeat the
clear intendment of the law, for not only does Republic Act No. 529 prohibit a
stipulation requiring payment in foreign currency or in gold but likewise a
stipulation providing for payment in Philippine currency measured in its value
in gold or in foreign currency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If incurred in Philippine currency, no
adjustment is to be made (hence, if <s>P</s>10,000.00 is borrowed, payable in
foreign currency, the same amount of <s>P</s>10,000.00 shall be due upon
payment irrespective of any change in the rates of exchange prevailing at the
time the obligation is constituted and the time it is paid) except to the
extent that Article 1250 of the Civil Code on extraordinary inflation or
deflation can apply; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If incurred in foreign currency or in
Philippine currency but based on foreign exchange values, the payment shall be
made in Philippine currency measured at the rate of exchange prevailing at the
time of payment (hence, a $1-obligation, incurred at a time when the rate of
exchange was $1:<s>P</s>10.00 and when payable the rate became $1:<s>P</s>20.00,
should be paid in Philippine Currency at <s>P</s>20.00).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, I consider it more important to preserve the
stability of, rather than to disturb, the now settled rule heretofore expressed
by this Court in earlier cases.  I,
therefore, VOTE to concur in the opinion and to LEAVE the matter to Congress
whether it would wish to consider any further need for remedial legislation.</p>
