				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue before us <span style="">is </span>the
correct interpretation of the following provision in Article XII of the
collective bargaining agreement between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span>
Mining Corporation and private respondent National Mines and Allied Workers
Union (NAMAWU):</p>

<blockquote>Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The COMPANY
agrees to grant <span style="">a </span>severance pay
equivalent to twenty (20) days of <span style="">base wage </span>for every year <span style="">of </span>service to regular employees
covered by this Agreement who leave the COMPANY other than for cause before
qualifying for early retirement under the Retirement Plan <span style="">as </span>provided hereunder, provided,
however, that an employee who voluntarily resigns from the <span style="">COMPANY </span>shall not be entitled to the
benefits herein unless he has completed at least ten (10) years of services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any dismissal on ground of illness shall be
treated in accordance with the provisions of the Labor Code as amended and its
implementing rules and regulations except that where an employee who has
rendered ten (10) or more years of service to the COMPANY shall be entitled to
the above benefit in lieu of what is provided for under the Labor Code.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This case arose when three employees of the petitioner company,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Petronio</span> Robles and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Rances</span>,
died after <span style="">serving </span>therein for
17, 12, and 18 years respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to the CBA, the petitioner paid the heirs of the deceased
employees the proceeds of the group life insurance plan and the cash value of
their unused vacation and sick leaves, besides waiving certain amounts owing to
it by <span class="SpellE">Rances</span> and Robles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The payments are itemized <span style="">as </span>follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Robles, all represented by herein complainant union, separation pay equivalent
to twenty (20) days salary for every year of service.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rationale of the decision was explained thus:</p>

<blockquote>There is an apparent doubt on how Section I is to be
interpreted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in consonance with
Article 4, Preliminary Title, Labor Code, aforesaid provision should be
interpreted in <span style="">favor </span>of
Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Statutes granting rights to
laborers are liberally construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Union
Trust Co. vs. State, 24 LRA (NS) 111).</blockquote>

<blockquote>But even in the absence of Article 4 of the Labor Code, which
provides -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Construction in favor of labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All doubts in the implementation and interpretation of the <span class="SpellE">provisisons</span> of this Code, including <span style="">its implementing rules and regulations shall be resolved in </span>favor
of labor.</p>

<blockquote>It would still appear that the claim of
complainant union is founded on cogent logic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The granting by the company of severance pay to its employees who leave
other than for cause is, in effect, a recognition of their services worthy of <span style="">a </span>reward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be easily discussed <span style="">from subject provision the rationale and
purpose for the granting of severance pay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provision aims and intends to provide to the employee and his family
financial security, at least during the period immediately following his
leaving the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will, therefore,
be absurd and self-defeating if subject CBA provision will be interpreted otherwise
as it </span>is precisely in case of death of the employee that his family
needs most the severance benefit or assistance contemplated in the provision
under consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state
that by reason <span style="">of </span>death of <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Rances</span> and <span class="SpellE">Petronio</span> Robles the
source of livelihood of their heirs was <span style="">extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only fitting that they should be
rewarded in consideration of their length of service, which reward should be
extended to their heirs in the form of severance pay.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Anent the contention of respondent that the heirs have already
received certain fringe benefits, it should be remembered those were proceeds
emanating from insurance contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
severance pay being claimed does not spring from said insurance contract but by
virtue of <span style="">a </span>separate provision
of the CBA.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span> appealed to the <span style="">NLRC, </span>which affirmed the decision on <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1987</st1:date>, and denied the
motion for reconsideration on <st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="1">January
 4, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i><span style=""> </span>was then filed <span style="">on </span>the grounds that the <span style="">NLRC </span>committed grave abuse of
discretion in its interpretation of the questioned CBA provision; in not taking
into account the various amounts due to <span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span>
from the deceased employees which it had written off as an act of compassion
and in recognition of the deceased employees’ non-entitlement to separation
pay; and in disregarding the affidavits of release and quitclaim executed by
the heirs of the deceased employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the clause "who leave the
company other than for cause" is clear and unambiguous, leaving no room <span style="">for </span>interpretation and calling for the
application of Article 1370 of the Civil Code, <u>viz</u>.:</p>

<blockquote>Article 1370.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the terms
of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the
contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulation shall control.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Leave" should be given a literal or dictionary
interpretation <span style="">as
</span>signifying "willful departure with intent to remain away and not
temporary absence with intention of returning."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The word <span style="">should </span>be understood as
referring to a positive and voluntary act of departure and does not include
death, which is involuntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
the Pilipino equivalent of the word "leave" <span style="">as </span>used in the official translation
of the CBA, is "<span class="SpellE">aalis</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arguendo</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>that
the provision is not really clear, Article 4 of the Labor Code should not have
been resorted to as this applies <span style="">only </span>in
case of doubt in <span style="">the </span>interpretation
and implementation of the provisions of the Labor Code and its implementing
rules and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CBA being <span style="">a </span>contract, the rules embodied in the
Civil Code on interpretation of contracts should govern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intent of the parties should be
ascertained by considering relevant provisions <span style="">of </span>the CBA on the retirement plan, the group life insurance, and
bereavement assistance together with Section 1 <span style="">in </span>the light of Article 1374 of the <span style="">Civil </span>Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner further points out that aside from dismissal for
cause, there are only three modes by which an employer-employee relationship i<span style="">s </span>terminated, to wit, voluntary
resignation, retirement and death of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Code does not require separation
pay in these instances, but the CBA corrects the omission <span style="">by </span>providing for these
contingencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, death benefits
consisting of bereavement assistance under Section 5<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and insurance proceeds are made available under the group life insurance plan,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
resignation benefits under Section 1,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and retirement benefits under Section 2,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
of the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">The phrase "other than for cause" in reference to
"early retirement" taken in <span style="">conjunction
</span>with "leave" connotes <span style="">a
v</span>oluntary, willful and intentional act of separation other than by
retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If "other than for
cause" were construed to include even death, which is involuntary, the
reference to early retirement would be meaningless.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner adds that insurance proceeds are given in case of
death to help the family of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The grant of severance pay in case of death would extend the scope of
the benefit beyond its purpose and defeat the intent behind the grant <span style="">of </span>funeral benefits, retirement
benefits and severance <span style="">coverage </span>in
the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it also maintains, the heirs of the deceased have
executed quitclaims/releases which now bar them from demanding severance pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">For their part, the respondents argue that while resignation is <span style="">a </span>voluntary
mode of separation, dismissal on the ground of illness is also provided for in
the same Section 1 of Article XII although it is an involuntary mode of
separation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the word
"leave" is used in its generic sense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To grant severance pay to an employee who is dismissed on the ground of
illness and to exclude one who dies is to them "a myopic and constricted <span style="">view." </span>The p<span style="">rovision </span>should be interpreted under
the spirit that gives life and not the letter that <span class="SpellE">killeth</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents see no reason why the deceased employees should
be placed at a disadvantage merely because they did not resign or were
dismissed on the ground of illness after having served the company for more
than 10 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a worker who willingly
leaves the company is entitled <span style="">to </span>severance
pay under the CBA, the same benefit should not be denied one, <span style="">who, </span>through no choice of his own, is
separated from employment by reason of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">They also contend that the NLRC correctly applied not only
Article 4 of the Labor Code but also Article 1702 of the Civil Code, <span style="">which </span>applies not only to labor
legislation but also to labor contracts, thus:</p>

<blockquote>Article 1702.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of
doubt, all labor legislation and all labor contracts shall be construed in
favor of the safety and decent living for the laborer.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents point out that there is nothing in the
CBA <span style="">which </span>states that insurance
benefits and severance pay are mutually exclusive, unlike retirement and
severance pay under Section 2, Article XII.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, it is the insurance company that pays the insurance
benefits while it is the company or employer that is liable for severance
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the primary purpose of
the CBA is to provide more benefits to workers, the contract would be rendered
more effectual if the heirs were awarded both insurance benefits and severance
pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General takes the side of the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He maintains that the clause "who leave
the company other than for cause" literally includes death as a manner of
leaving the company because death terminates an existing employer-employee
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be validly
argued that the leave-taking mentioned in the phrase refers exclusively to
voluntary resignation because the very same article is made applicable also to
any employee who <span style="">is </span>dismissed on
the ground of illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as he has
rendered at least 10 years of service, the employee shall also be entitled to
the benefits therein provided although his separation is not voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the parties to the CBA had really intended
<span style="">a </span>restrictive interpretation of
the provision in question, they would have so provided clearly and placed the
word <u>voluntarily</u> before the word "leave."</p>

<p class="BODY">These are the arguments of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now for the opinion of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The title of Article XII is SEVERANCE, RETIREMENT AND LIFE
INSURANCE.</p>

<p class="BODY">Severance is "the termination of contractual association (as
employment)."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Severance pay is defined as "an allowance usually based on length of
service that is payable to an employee on severance except usually in case of
disciplinary discharge"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
or as "compensation due an employee upon the severance of his employment
status with the employer."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The word <u>leave</u> is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as
"willful departure with intent to remain away" and in Webster's <span style="">as </span>to
"desert, abandon, forsake, to terminate association with, quit the service
of.” Given these definitions, the petitioner <span style="">argues that </span>death should <span style="">not
</span>be included in the term as this is an involuntary mode of separation <span style="">that </span>is covered by another provision
of the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a correct conclusion insofar as the word is used in the
basic rule embodied in Section 1 of Article XII of the CBA declaring that those
entitled to severance pay are regular employees "who leave the COMPANY
other than for cause before qualifying for <span style="">early </span>retirement <span style="">under </span>the
Retirement <span style="">Plan as </span>provided
hereunder, provided, however, that an employee <span style="">who </span>voluntarily resigns from the COMPANY <span style="">shall </span>not be entitled to the benefits herein unless he has
completed at least ten (10) <span style="">years </span>of
service."</p>

<p class="BODY">The trouble with the petitioner's contention is <span style="">that </span>it is a generalization that does
not take into account the specific <span style="">exce</span>p<span style="">tion </span>thereto that in fact has been
clearly expressed also in the same provision of the CBA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last part of the section reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Any dismissal <span style="">on ground o</span>f illness shall be treated
in accordance with the provisions of <span style="">the
Labor Code as amended and </span>its<span style="">
implementing rules<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and regulations
except that where an employee who has rendered ten (10) or more years </span>of
<span style="">service to the COMPANY shall be
entitled to the above benefit in lieu of </span>what is <span style="">provided for under the </span><span style="">Labor
</span><span style="">Code.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would really seem strange, as the private respondent muses,
that while an employee who is dismissed for illness <span style="">may </span>be entitled to severance <span style="">pay </span>under this exception, he <span style="">will </span>not be <span style="">similarly
benefited </span>if he <u>dies</u> of that illness during his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death, to be sure, is an involuntary mode of
separation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with NAMAWU,
however, that it is covered by the situation contemplated in the above-cited
exception, which, if it is to be reasonably interpreted, should include the
aggravation <span style="">of </span>illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception, as we understand it, is
intended to provide some measure of relief to the dismissed employee, on the
justification that it is not his fault that he is ill <span style="">and </span>he needs some financial assistance for his cure and
treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is clearly not the
worker's fault either if he should die in the course of his employment, nor can
it be suggested that he needs in this case less financial assistance, we see no
reason why he should be treated differently.</p>

<p class="BODY">This interpretation need not <span style="">be </span>based on the rule that doubts on the meaning of labor
contracts should be resolved in favor of labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It <span style="">is </span>dictated,
as we see it, by ordinary logic and by the obvious intendment behind the
above-quoted exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court will
concede that without this exception, the general rule preceding it would have
defeated the private respondents’ claim for severance pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as the petitioner itself correctly
contends, the section must be read in its entirety and, indeed, in relation to
the rest of the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also our belief, and we so hold, that the
quitclaims/releases, while concededly made voluntarily, did not constitute <span style="">a </span>knowing
waiver of the severance pay because the heirs of the deceased employees were
not <span style="">aware at
</span>that time that they were entitled to such pay.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded that the insurance benefits should be discounted
because they do not come from the insurance company and not the petitioner
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span>the contrary, the private respondents should be properly
grateful therefore because these would not have been available at all if the
petitioner had not paid the premiums on the group insurance of its employees,
who have not contributed <span style="">a </span>single centavo for such payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, we agree that the insurance
benefits do not exclude the severance pay <span style="">as </span>there is no clear agreement on that point
nor has the petitioner pointed to any <span style="">law
</span>or rule clearly providing for such exclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court <span style="">is </span>convinced
that the petitioner has acted <span style="">in </span>complete
good faith in this case and that its position is based on <span style="">a </span>sincere
and even reasonable interpretation of the section in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, it should have operated in its
favor were it not for the exception embodied therein as we now interpret
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must add that <span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span>
should be commended for its treatment of the heirs of the deceased employees,
particularly <span class="SpellE">Rances</span> and Robles, whose respective
accountabilities in the amounts of P33,594.68 and P15,739.55 it voluntarily and
graciously wrote off as <span style="">a </span>gesture of good will and generosity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This speaks well of its attitude toward its
loyal employees, who for their part appear to be appreciative enough albeit
they cannot yield on this question before us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is their right, of course.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, the Court is gratified over the intelligent and respectful
debate of the parties in their pleadings which it found especially noteworthy
for the lack of acrimony and <span class="SpellE">bellicoseness</span> that
usually taint adversarial discussions, particularly in labor disputes.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule for the private respondents, but not completely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court feels that if the private
respondents are to be given severance pay, <span style="">as we </span>here hold, it is <span style="">only
fair </span>that the amounts earlier condoned by the petitioner be also taken
into account in the final disposition of the conflicting claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even as we disregard the quitclaims of
the private respondents on the ground that these did not cover the severance
pay, so too must we in fairness deduct such severance pay from the amounts the
petitioner has waived in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that Robles is entitled to severance pay of
P11,508.00 for 12 years service and <span class="SpellE">Rances</span> to
P21,096.00 for 18 years service, and that they had outstanding liabilities of
P15,739.55 and P33,594.68, respectively, that were condoned by the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their severance pay should
now be charged against their indebtedness, leaving <span style="">a </span>balance of P4,231.55 against Robles
and P12,498.68, respectively, still due to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the amounts only that are deemed
waived by the petitioner after full settlement of the severance pay of the
deceased employees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED and the challenged
decision AFFIRMED, but with the modification that the severance pay due to the
private respondents is deemed paid and covered by the amounts previously
condoned by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The severance
pay owing to <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gamboa</span></span><span style=""> shall be paid in full.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
