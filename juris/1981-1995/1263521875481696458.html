				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-46771, March 07, 1984</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND LUCIA BASAN, PETITIONERS, VS. HONORABLE MARCELINO M. FRANCISCO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO DEL SUR, GODOFREDO CABAHUG AND BENEDICTA CENIZA, RESPONDENTS. <br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
This is a petition to set aside the decision of the respondent judge in a
 criminal case for concubinage.  The decision acquitted the accused, the
 private respondents, on a demurrer to the evidence after the 
prosecution had rested its case.
<p>
The petitioners claim that they were denied due process because the Demurrer to Evidence did not have a notice of hearing.
</p><p>
True it is that the Demurrer to Evidence did not have a notice of 
hearing.  However, the petitioners were furnished a copy thereof and in 
fact they filed an Opposition.  The claim of denial of due process is, 
therefore, without basis.  Neither were the petitioners denied due 
process when the respondent judge did not consider the evidence 
mentioned in the Opposition to the demurrer for such evidence was not 
formally presented.
</p><p>
Moreover, to reopen the case will place the private respondents in double jeopardy for assuming <em>arguendo </em>that
 the respondent judge had committed a mistake, the error does not 
vitiate the decision considering that he had jurisdiction over the case.
  (City Fiscal of Cebu vs. Kintanar, L-31842, April 30, 1970, 32 SCRA 
601.)
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, in accordance with the recommendation of the Solicitor 
General who represents the People of the Philippines in criminal cases, 
the instant petition is hereby dismissed for lack of merit.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar</em>, Acting C.J., (<em>Chairman</em>), <em>Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, De Castro</em> and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
