On December 29, 1978, petitioners received the decision, dated December 11, 1978, of respondent trial court in Land Registration Case No. 305; </p> <p>"2. On January 25, 1979, or within the 30-day reglamentary period to perfect their appeal, the petitioners filed their notice of appeal, cash bond and a Motion for Extension Of Time To File Typewritten Record On Appeal; </p> <p>"3. The Motion For Extension Of Time To File Typewritten Record on Appeal was originally set for hearing on January 29, 1979; </p> <p>"4. On January 29, 1979, the respondent trial court reset the hearing of the Motion For Extension Of Time To File Typewritten Record on Appeal to the next available date of the court's calendar; </p> <p>"5. Until March 1, 1979, respondent trial court had not set for hearing nor resolved the afore-said Motion For Extension Of Time To File Typewritten Record On Appeal; </p> <p>"6. On March 1, 1979, petitioners filed their Typewritten Record on Appeal; </p> <p>"7. On March 2, 1979, respondent trial court disapproved the Cash Appeal Bond and the Record on Appeal on the ground that the same were filed out of time; </p> <p>"8. On March 22, 1979, petitioners filed their Motion For Reconsideration of the Order, dated March 2, 1979; and </p> <p>"9. On November 21, 1980, respondent trial court denied the said Motion For Reconsideration. </p> <p>"From the foregoing undisputed material facts of the case, it is easy to see that when petitioners filed their Motion For Extension Of Time To File Typewritten Record On Appeal on January 25, 1989, they still had three (3) days left within which to perfect their appeal. Pending the resolution of that Motion, the 3-day period left to perfect the appeal would still be available to the petitioners. </p> <p>"Since there is no dispute that the Motion for Extension of Time to File Typewritten Record on Appeal was filed on time, the said Motion must, therefore, be granted in line with the decisions in Baquiran vs. Court of Appeals, 2 SCRA 873 and Galima vs. Court of Appeals, 16 SCRA 140. </p> <p>“When, on January 29, 1979, respondent trial court reset the hearing of the Motion For Extension Of Time To File Typewritten Record on Appeal, the running of the period to perfect the appeal was implicitly stayed and petitioners still had three (3) days to perfect their appeal. </p> <p>"Considering that until March 1, 1979, when petitioners filed their Typewritten Record on Appeal, the respondent trial court had not yet set for hearing nor resolved the Motion For Extension Of Time To File Typewritten Record On Appeal, the 3-day period left for petitioners to perfect their appeal was still intact and undiminished. </p> <p>"Therefore, the filing of the REcord on Appeal on March 1, 1979, was well within the 30-day reglamentary period given by the rules to petitioners to perfect their appeal. In fact, it was three (3) days before the 30-day period to appeal would lapse. </p> <p>"It should need no further elaboration, therefore, to reach the ineluctable conclusion that the disapproval on March 2, 1979, by respondent trial court of the Record on Appeal and the Cash Appeal Bond, on the ground that the same were filed out of time, was grossly erroneous. </p> <p>"The questioned Orders, dated March 2, 1979 and November 21, 1980, must, consequently, be set aside and rendered null and void."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>The submission of the petitioners is devoid of merit. The motion for extension of the period within which to file the record on appeal did not suspend the running of the period within which to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p>The petitioners received a copy of the decision on December 29, 1978. Hence, they had until January 28 within which to perfect their appeal. They filed a motion for extension of thirty (30) days within which to file their typewritten record on appeal on January 25, 1979 and set the hearing thereof on January 29, 1979 after the expiration of the reglementary period of thirty days. On the date of hearing neither the petitioners nor their counsel appeared. Hence, the trial court issued the following order: </p><blockquote> <p>"When the 'Notice of Appeal and with Cash Appeal Bond with Motion for Extension of Time to File Typewritten Record on Appeal' was called movant counsel Atty. Galdino Jardin was not around; Atty. Arturo Legaspi appeared for the oppositors and so, the motion cannot be heard. </p> <p>"Let it be set to the next available date of the calendar of this court. </p> <p>"SO ORDERED. </p> <p>"Dictated in open Court this 29th day of January, 1979, at Cagayan de Oro City. </p> <p>"(SGD) TAGO M. BANTUAS </p></blockquote> <p>Executive Judge"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p>When the applicants, petitioners herein, filed a typewritten record on appeal, the same was set for hearing on March 2, 1979. On said date the counsel for the applicants, petitioners herein, again failed to appear. The counsel for the private respondents appeared and opposed the motion for the approval of the record on appeal because the same was filed out of time. Hence the trial court disapproved the record on appeal in the following order: </p><blockquote> <p>"When the motion for approval of the record on appeal was called at 10:57 in the morning, movant counsel, Atty. Galdino Jardin, was not around. Atty. Arturo Legaspi, for the oppositors-appellees, informed the Court that he was only furnished a copy of the record on appeal yesterday, March 1, 1979, and he has no time to make a written opposition to the approval of the record on appeal, but in open Court he argued that the motion for the approval of the record on appeal be denied because the record on appeal was filed out of time. </p> <p>"Considering that Atty. Galdino Jardin for the second time was not again present, the record on appeal and the appeal bond are hereby disapproved. </p> <p>"SO ORDERED. </p> <p>"Dictated in open Court this 2nd day of March, 1979, at Cagayan de Oro City. </p> <p>"(SGD) TAGO M. BANTUAS </p></blockquote> <p>Executive Judge"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p>The respondent court denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the order disapproving the record on appeal because: </p><blockquote> <p>"On January 25, 1979 the applicants, through counsel, filed a "Notice of Appeal, And With Cash Appeal Bond, with Motion for Extension of Time to file Typewritten Record on Appeal' and set it for hearing on January 29, 1979 at 9:00 A.M. The request for extension of time to file record on appeal mixed up into the notice of appeal and the filing of the cash bond was not resolved on January 29, 1979 as set because neither movant counsel nor his clients were around, while the oppositors through counsel were. The Court ordered the motion to be reset to the next available date (p. 216, records). On March 1, 1979 the applicants through counsel filed their Record on Appeal and set it for approval on March 2, 1979 at 9:00 A.M. Again neither the applicants nor their counsel was around when the record on appeal was called for approval on March 2, 1979 and the counsel for the oppositors was allowed to argue and point out that the record on appeal was filed out of time. For this reason and considering that movant counsel then seemed not to mind the calendar of the case for two times already, the Court disapproved the record on appeal and entered its said order of March 2, 1979. </p> <p>"Among others and in effect, movant counsel now argues that his appearance in the motion for the approval of the record on appeal is not necessary, for the Court has to approve the record on appeal anyway. Set against the objection of the oppositors that the record on appeal was filed out of time, the contention of the movant is without merit. </p> <p>"Upon the other hand, movant contends that the record on appeal was filed within the reglamentary period. In effect he states that although his clients received the decision in the case on December 29, 1979, the reglamentary period was extended by virtue of his mere filing of a 30-day period of extension. As earlier pointed out, the motion for extension of time was never resolved and movant counsel did not bother to have it so resolved. He contends that because there was no order denying it, it is deemed granted. He did not mind the direction of the Court that the motion be reset for hearing, and he likewise, perhaps, did not give thought to the fact that the Judge was only acting as Executive Judge and cannot check up the daily calendars of all salas of the Court. </p> <p>"But even granting, arguendo, that the motion for extension of time should be deemed granted, yet the record on appeal filed on March 1 1979 is still out of time. For, as pointed out by Atty. Arturo Legaspi, counsel for the oppositors, in his opposition to the motion for reconsideration,'. . . the 30 day extension period by applicants. . .should be computed from January 28, 1979, the last day of the original 30 day period from December 29, 1978 when applicants received the decision. Therefore, when applicants filed the record on appeal on March 1, 1979, 32 days had already elapsed. . ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>From the facts of record, it is clear that the respondent court did not commit a grave abuse of discretion in disapproving the record on appeal. </p><p>In Rose Industries, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Supreme Court held: </p><blockquote> <p>"It is true that the trial court is vested with discretion to allow or admit an appeal filed out of time. However, this discretion is not unconditional. 'Interest of justice' cannot be invoked against the rule fixing the period within which to appeal without legal justification to warrant such action. (Trans-Philippines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 78 SCRA 154, 161). </p> <p>"In those cases where the Supreme Court justified a suspension of the Rules to afford a litigant an opportunity to prosecute his appeal filed out of time, emphasis was stressed on the merit of the appeal to justify consideration from the appellate tribunal. (Ong Tiao Seng vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 81 SCRA 417, 423) </p> <p>"In the instant case, there is no showing of a legal justification to sanction the resolution of the Court of Appeals dated February 1, 1977 allowing the appeal of the private respondent Sentinel Insurance Company, Inc."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>It was also held in Toribio vs. Bidin,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> that: </p><blockquote> <p>"Although the Court has ruled that the Rules should be liberally interpreted as regards the period to perfect an appeal so as to afford litigants just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their controversy, the discretion to allow or admit an appeal filed out of time should be based upon legal justification. The Court has also stressed the merit of the appeal to justify a review on equitable grounds. (Catinding vs. Court of Appeals, L-33063, Feb. 28, 1979; and other cases cited therein, 88 SCRA 675; Rose Industries Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, L-45581, Dec. 29, 1978, and other cases cited therein, 87 SCRA 452). </p> <p>"In the instant case, the decision of the trial court appears to be correct so that the allowance of the appeal of the petitioner would serve no useful purpose and would merely delay the administration of justice x x x" </p> <p>In the case at bar, the trial court ordered the registration of the title to the land in question in the name of the private respondents because: </p> <p>"From the evidence established therefore, the oppositors, Heirs of Benito Sabana has been in actual, physical, open, public adverse, peaceful, notorious, continuous and in actual possession and cultivation over Lot 2161 in the concept of owner for more than fifty (50) years including that of their predecessors-in-interest, which has already ripened into ownership. (Osingsiaco vs. Masilang, 50 Phil. 380, 386)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>There is no showing that the appeal of the petitioners is meritorious in the sense that they can overcome the factual finding of the trial court that the private respondents have "been in actual, physical, open, public adverse, peaceful, notorious, continuous and in actual possession and cultivation over Lot 2161 in the concept of owner for more than fifty (50) years including that of their predecessors-in-interest xxx". Perhaps this explains the lackadaisical actuations of the counsel for the petitioners who did not appear at the hearing of the motion for extension of the period within which to file a typewritten record on appeal and at the hearing of the approval of the said record on appeal. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition for certiorari and mandamus is hereby denied and the orders sought to be set aside are affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs. </p><strong>SO ORDERED. </strong><br><br><em>Teehankee, Acting C.J., Makasiar, Guerrero, Melencio-Herrera, </em>and <em>Plana, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br> <hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 12-13. <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, pp. 28-29. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Memorandum for the Petitioners, Rollo, pp. 102-103. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Roque vs. Gunigundo, 89 SCRA 178. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Rollo, p. 35. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Rollo, p. 36. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Rollo, pp. 45-46. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 87 SCRA, 452. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Ibid., pp. 457-458. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 96 SCRA 361, 366. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Rollo, p. 28. </p></div>
