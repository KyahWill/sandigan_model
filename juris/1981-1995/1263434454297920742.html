<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The present case arose
from the killing of Pelarito Abujan in Barangay Baikingon, Cagayan de Oro City.  The victim died apparently of gunshot wounds
in the forehead and neck which were inflicted on him on the night of May 28,
1986.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

to the dance hall of Barangay Baikingon when he was waylaid.  Prosecution witness Allan Gamlot recalled
that only he and Alexander Abujan were with the victim during the incident.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

witness for the prosecution, Eddie Apus, said that the deceased was with other
companions, namely, himself (Apus), Alexander Abujan, </span>Allan Gamlot and a
certain Mario Diamar.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Both these witnesses
related that they were passing by a banana plantation situated along the road
to the dance hall </span>when a shot suddenly rang out.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Pelarito Abujan, who, according to Apus, was walking ahead of the others with
Gamlot, tried to investigate and went near the banana grove from where the shot
came.  At this juncture, a second shot
rang <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">out, </span>after which the third
shot followed.  Pelarito Abujan then
fell with his face downward.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, Apus allegedly saw appellant and an
unidentified companion, fleeing uphill after first emerging from the nearby
banana plantation.  The group proceeded
to help the stricken Pelarito Abujan but they found him already dead.  They then brought the body of the victim to
his house in Baikingon and that same evening, Apus reported the incident to
Police Corporal Eleuterio Cabigon at the Divisoria Bandstand in Cagayan de Oro
City.  Cabigon and five other policemen
went to the alleged residence of appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">at </span>Baikingon to arrest him but they found it deserted with a
lighted kerosene lamp upstairs.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, appellant interposed the defense of alibi.  He vigorously maintained that he had no
participation in the killing of Pelarito Abujan for he was then <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the house of his employer, Engineer
Romualdo Gaylo, at Dolores Tomas Street, Carmen, in Cagayan de Oro City.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

He admitted that he had a house in Baikingon but left the place when he sold
his house there in November, 1984.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> He
then transferred to Barangay Tagpangi and, in December, 1985, came to live in
Carmen when he was hired by Engineer Gaylo as mason and watchman.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">His defense of alibi was amply corroborated by Gaylo who
testified that appellant was indeed staying at his house on that night of May
28, 1986 since he was the watchman there.  Gaylo also said that public utility vehicles usually stop <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">plying </span>the route between Baikingon a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nd</span> Carmen at around 5:00 or 6:00 P.M.

between these places.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant is now before us seeking the reversal of the judgment
of conviction and faulting the court below of having erred (1) in finding him
as the perpetrator of the crime charged and in not relying on the testimony of
appellant and his corroborating witness; and (2) in holding that the
circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution is sufficient for his
conviction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The assigned errors basically assail the trial court's favorable
appreciation of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and its factual
findings based thereon.  On this point,
the rule is that the findings of fact of the trial court are entitled to great
weight and at times even finality, except in instances where the findings are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not </span>supported by the record or are not
based on substantial evidence or where the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Further, where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the issue </span>raised
relates to the matter of credibility of a witness, the findings thereon of the
trial court are accorded the highest degree of respect and will not generally
be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">disturbed on </span>appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
There would, however, be a deviation from this rule if it is shown that the
trial judge has overlooked some material or substantial facts which, if
considered, could alter or affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">A thorough review of the records convinces us that the findings
of the trial court herein complained of have no evidentiary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">su</span>pp<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">ort.  </span>Said court failed
to take into account material and substantial inconsistencies and
contradictions in the testimonies of the principal witnesses for the
prosecution, Allan Gamlot and Eddie Apus, which to this Court are indubitably
corrosive of their credibility.  This
necessarily sweeps away the strands in the web of circumstantial evidence
proffered by the prosecution, which evidence the Solicitor General submits are
the following:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  Allan Gamlot and Eddie Apus categorically
stated that they saw appellant, armed with a handgun, together with an
unidentified companion emerge from the banana groove (sic) from where the shots
rang out;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Appellant and his companion ran away after
emerging from said banana groove (sic);</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Appellant himself admitted that Pelarito
Abujan killed the former's brother sometime in 1983.  At best, it can rightfully be said that he had an axe to grind
against<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> t</span>he deceased;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Appellant's flight is a strong indication
of guilt;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  Luisito Ragmac's testimony on rebuttal to
the effect that appellant boasted of having killed Pelarito Abujan.  Luisito is the 'bilas' of appellant.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A conviction may rest upon circumstantial evidence alone as
direct evidence is not always necessary to prove the guilt of the accused<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

nor is it readily available.  But the
well-entrenched rule is that such evidence should be acted upon and weighed
with extreme caution, particularly where, as in this case, the crime for which
the accused stands to be convicted carries with it the highest imposable
penalty of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>perpetua</u>.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

the Court laid down the rule that -</p>

<blockquote>"Before conviction can be had upon circumstantial evidence,
the circumstances proved should constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one
fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the defendant, to the exclusion of
all others, as the author of the crime."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As it was principally upon the testimonies of Allan Gamlot and
Eddie Apus that the prosecution sought to incriminate appellant by
circumstantial evidence, the unreliability of their respective testimonies
cannot lead us to that fair and reasonable conclusion that appellant was the
one who committed the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at its judgment of conviction, the trial court opines
that the following considerations were more than enough to show beyond doubt
the guilt of appellant, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Concededly, and as strongly stressed by the counsel for the
accused in his memorandum, there was no eyewitness to the actual shooting.  However, the government witnesses
categorically declared that after they heard the two burst(s) of gunfire in the
direction of the banana grooves (sic), Pelarito Abuhan fell and not long after,
the accused Deogracias Jalon was seen coming out from the banana grooves (sic)
bringing with him a gun together with an unidentified companion.  The accused was positively identified by two
government witnesses who were present during the incident; that although it was
night time they positively identified the accused because they were at a
distance of only about fifty (50) meters and besides it was not very dark at
that time and that they already knew Deogracias Jalon even before the incident;
that immediately after the incident, they reported to the police station at the
Divisoria Bandstand that they were ambushed that very night which resulted in
the death of Pelarito Abujan and pointed to the accused as the author of the
crime.  In fact, Cpl. Cabigon
accompanied the group back to Baikingon to effect the arrest of the accused but
the accused was nowhere to be found.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the present case, the two (2) witnesses who were the
companions of the deceased on that fateful evening positively identified the
accused as he emerged from the banana grooves (sic) where the gun report came
from, 30 seconds later, with an identified (sic) companion running towards the
upper portion.  x x x."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, a closer perusal of the record at hand and a careful
analysis and calibration of the evidence presented in the court below would
readily disclose facts contrary to its foregoing findings and which would
conduce to a conclusion different from that in its assailed decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Key prosecution witness Allan Gamlot, a nephew of the victim,
testified on direct <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">examination </span>that
he and Alexander Abujan were walking to the dance hall with the deceased at
about nine o'clock in the evening of that day when they were fired at.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
At the sound of the third shot, he hit the ground for cover and saw the victim
fall down.  Immediately thereafter, he
rose and went to look for Alexander Abujan who had apparently fled from the
scene during the shooting.  After
locating Abujan, they went back to where the victim fell and, at this point,
saw appellant and a companion fleeing from the banana grove.  Gamlot further recalled that both appellant
and his companion were carrying firearms.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When queried on cross-examination how much time it took him to
locate Abujan, Gamlot replied "Quite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
</span>time." It had, in fact, taken him an hour to look for Alexander
Abujan whom he found at the house of Linda Dablio.  The latter's house was at a distance from the scene of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
The intervening time of one hour during which Gamlot went to look for Abujan is
highly significant for, in accordance with common experience and the natural
order of things, the perpetrators would have instantly fled since nobody was
left to attend to the fallen Pelarito Abujan and, consequently, they had all
the opportunity to escape without anyone seeing them.  It would certainly be absurd for them to have waited for one hour
and then make a dash for elusion when Gamlot and Abujan were already back and
thus risk being seen by the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Irremissibly, therefore, the findings of the trial court are
clearly at variance with and are not substantiated by the testimony of Allan Gamlot.  Moreover, there is nothing in the record to
show that the prosecution witnesses were at a distance of fifty meters from the
felons.  On the contrary, prosecution
witness Eddie Apus reckoned that they were supposedly only about three meters
away from where the shots were fired.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a> It
puzzles us, therefore, why the trial court did not take these inconsistencies
into account although it had apparently relied mainly on the eyewitness account
of Apus.</p>

<p class="BODY">But then, again, we have also carefully examined the transcripts
of the testimony of Apus and we find that there are likewise equally disturbing
aspects therein which seriously undermine his credibility and expose his
statements to be of dubious veracity.  Apus, a neighbor of the deceased, testified that at about eight o'clock
in the evening of May 28, 1986, he was entertaining Mario Diamar in his house
in Baikingon when Pelarito Abujan, Allan Gamlot and Alexander Abujan arrived
for supper.  They partook of some drinks
and then decided after an hour to proceed to the Baikingon dance hall.  Apus narrated that the victim and Allan
Gamlot walked ahead of them followed by some two meters behind by himself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(Apus), </span>Alexander Abujan and Mario
Diamar when the three gunshots successively rang out, with the last shot felling
the victim.  He further related that
thirty seconds later, as they were lifting the body of the deceased, the rest
of them saw appellant with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>gun
and a companion scampering from the nearby banana grove.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Apus stated that Allan Gamlot was the first
to rush to the aid of Pelarito Abujan since he was walking ahead <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with </span>the deceased, that at the height
of the shooting Gamlot crawled just beside the latter and, immediately after
the firing ceased, Gamlot then helped in lifting the body of the victim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
The foregoing statement of Apus plainly contradicts the account of Gamlot, as
earlier noted, that immediately after the third shot he ran away to look <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>Alexander Abujan and they only
came back after the lapse of one hour.  Moreover, both prosecution witnesses likewise gave conflicting
statements as to who was wielding a gun.  While Apus asserted that only appellant had a gun with him,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
Gamlot, on the other hand, said that both appellant and his companion were each
armed with a firearm.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Parenthetically, we find it rather strange that appellant and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">his </span>companion are supposed to have
first displayed themselves openly to the companions of the victim and
consequently be recognized by the latter, instead of running away through and
under cover of the darkness of the banana plantation to avoid detection or
recognition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further significant that throughout <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">his </span>direct and cross-examination, Gamlot never made mention of
Eddie Apus and Mario Diamar, or of the fact that they had gone to the house of
Apus for supper and some drinks, or that Apus and Diamar had been with them on
that fateful night.  Logically, he would
have disclosed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>the court the
aforementioned facts but it perplexes us that he did<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>not.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It </span>is to be noted that Gamlot was
presented as a witness ahead of Apus and he had executed a sworn statement
regarding the incident on June 5, 1986, or a week after the slaying.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, Eddie <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Apus, </span>who
was called to the witness stand on March 12, 1987, only came out into the open to
narrate in court his version of the killing almost one year after the fact, and
never gave nor executed an affidavit about the matter to the police
authorities.  When questioned on the
reason for the delay, he simply explained that he decided to testify only on
March 10, 1987 when he happened to converse with the wife of the deceased and
learned that there was going to be a hearing two days later.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
It is hard to believe that Apus came to know of the subsequent developments in
the case only on March 10, 1987 considering that he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>neighbor of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, indeed, he was with the victim and the others when the
incident took place, then it stands <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>reason
that he would have at least reported the fact of his presence during the
slaying and volunteered to testify as soon as the developments in the case
warranted.  And yet, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>all these, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">he </span>failed without any plausible reason at all and he has not even
given a credible explanation therefor.  In fact, Police Corporal Eleuterio Cabigon, to whom Apus allegedly
reported the incident that night, categorically declared that it was not Apus
but a certain Menello Cabanatuan, a "ronda tanod," who related to him
what had occurred.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">foregoing
</span>considerations, particularly the inexplicable failure of Allan Gamlot to
make mention in his testimony about Eddie Apus and the latter's belated
presentation of himself in court, cannot but give <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">rise </span>to the deduction that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Apus
</span>is a rehearsed witness whose testimony was contrived in order to create
a believable case for the prosecution.  This becomes more apparent in light of the fact that Gamlot had proved
to be an unreliable witness for the prosecution, having earlier given
conflicting and confusing answers to both the prosecution and the defense.  Evidence to be believed must proceed not
only from the mouth of a credible witness but the same must be credible in
itself as when it conforms to the common experience and observation of mankind.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, we have irreconcilable and unexplained contradictions on vital points in
the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses which necessarily disclose a
weakness in the case for the prosecution and cast crucial doubt on the guilt of
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Luisito Ragmac's testimony to the effect that appellant, for no
reason at all, demonstrated to him how the latter killed the deceased, deserves
no consideration, whatsoever, not only because of its inherent improbability
but also because both of them, Ragmac and Jalon, have had serious
misunderstandings and had been at odds for quite some time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, Ragmac admitted, at the time he testified, that he was not on good or
talking terms with appellant because the latter had intimidated and threatened
him during a quarrel right in the house of said witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the defense of appellant, it is true that alibi is one of the
weakest defenses an accused can invoke and for it to be considered favorably,
it must be shown that the accused was somewhere else when the crime was
committed and that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the
scene of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a> But
it is likewise settled that in advancing its cause, the prosecution must rely
on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of the defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, alibi as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>defense
assumes commensurate strength and significance where the evidence presented by
the prosecution are unreliable and uncertain,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
since it is not relieved of the <u>onus</u> <u>probandi</u> just because alibi
is the defense invoked by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, as we have heretofore pointed out, when the accused puts up
the defense of alibi, the court should not at once have a mental prejudice
against him.  For, taken in the light of
all the evidence of record, it may be sufficient to acquit him, especially
since every circumstance must be considered in favor of the presumption of
innocence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the evidence for the accused is presented to establish an alibi
is not a circumstance to be regarded as unfavorable to him, nor is the failure
to establish it a ground for suspicion, but the same must be considered in the
light of the other evidence in the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn48" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
There are situations where an accused can have no possible defense but alibi, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>that could reall<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">y</span> be the truth as to his whereabouts at
the time in question, and it may tilt the scales of justice in his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">favor </span>especially when the evidence for
the prosecution is contradictory and improbable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, aside from the intrinsic weakness of the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, there is likewise a very serious
doubt on the identification made of appellant as the culprit.  The rule is that the identity of the
offender, like the crime itself, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn49" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
and where the evidence of the prosecution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is
</span>weak and unsatisfactory, and the identification of the accused is not
reliable while the defense of alibi is adequately proved, the accused should be
acquitted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn50" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, not only are the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who identified
appellant demonstrably unreliable and vacillating, but Police Corporal
Eleuterio Cabigon, himself a prosecution witness, testified that the person
reported to their office as the killer, whose participation in the crime they
investigated, and whose house they searched immediately after the incident was
one Gaudencio Jalon, not the herein appellant Deogracias Jalon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn51" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
