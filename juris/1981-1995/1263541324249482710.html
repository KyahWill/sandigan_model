				<H3>TEODORICO CASTILLO, PETITIONER, VS. JUDGE PROCORO J. DONATO, BRANCH 24, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF ISABELA AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case is about the penalty for double homicide and damage to property through reckless imprudence.&nbsp; Teodorico Castillo on January 25, 1978, while recklessly driving a bus of the Philippine National Railways, bumped a jeepney on the highway at Cordon, Isabela with the result that the jeepney driver and passenger thereof were killed and the jeepney was totally wrecked.<br><br>He was charged and convicted of double homicide and damage to property through reckless imprudence.&nbsp; He was sentenced to two <i>(2) indeterminate penalties</i> of two years and four months of prision correccional as minimum to four years, nine months and ten days of <i>prision correccional</i> as maximum and to pay a fine of P25,000, the value of the jeepney.&nbsp; That judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Court.<br><br>No civil liability was adjudged because the offended parties filed a separate civil action against Castillo and his employer, the Philippine National Railways.<br><br>Castillo's application for probation was denied because the total imprisonment penalty imposed upon him was nine years, six months and twenty days, or more than six years.&nbsp; He filed the instant <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition case.&nbsp; He contends that only one penalty for the two deaths should have been imposed.<br><br>That contention is correct.&nbsp; He committed the complex crime of double homicide and damage to property through reckless imprudence by means of his single act of bumping the jeep (<i>People vs. Lara</i>, 75 Phil. 786; <i>People vs. Pacso</i>n, CA 46 O.G. 2165; <i>People vs. Biador</i>, CA 55 O.G. 6384).&nbsp; The imposition of the imprisonment penalty and the fine is justified (Angeles vs. Jose, 96 Phil. 151, 152).<br><br>But the decision had become final and executory.&nbsp; We cannot now change the penalty although excessive.&nbsp; The remedy lies with the Chief Executive, not with the courts (<i>Pomeroy vs. Director of Prisons,</i> 107 Phil. 50, 59).<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed.&nbsp; Pursuant to article 5 of the Revised Penal Code, the attention of the Chief Executive, through the Minister of Justice, is respectfully invited to the excessive penalty imposed on the petitioner.&nbsp; Only one indeterminate penalty should have been imposed on him.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Escolin,</i> and <i>Cuevas, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Abad Santos, J., </i>the trial court committed a mistake in imposing two penalties for a complex crime and the Appellate Court which is supposed to know better compounded the error. This is a reflection on the competency of persons who are appointed to deal with the life, liberty and property of fellow human beings.</div>
