<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution has
narrated the incident involved as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of September 9, 1974, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span> was asleep in her
house at <span class="SpellE">Oring</span>, Sta. Maria, <span class="SpellE">Mansalay</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> in the company of her son, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, her daughter-in-law, Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Dris</span>
<span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, and the latter's child (pp. 7, 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Feb. 13, 1975).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The barking of dogs awakened her, and looking outside through the
window, she saw two persons, running towards their kitchen (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> lighted a lamp and proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> to verify who the persons were and she was met by
appellants <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>
and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, Jr. who suddenly hacked her with
their bolos on the head and other parts of her body (pp. 10, 11, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
she <span class="GramE">laid</span> prostrate on the floor, her son, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, came out of their room but he was also met and
hacked by appellants until he fell down (pp. 14, 15, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Ibid)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, Romeo's wife, Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Dris</span>
<span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, was inside the room, and witnessing what
appellants did to her husband and mother-in-law, she hurriedly picked up her
child, jumped out of the window and ran towards the house of her brother-in-law
Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span> to whom she reported the incident
(pp. 42-48, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., March 13, 1975).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nathaniel immediately rushed to his mother's
place and as he approached the house, <span class="GramE">he</span> saw through
the window appellants Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span> hacking somebody
on the floor (pp. 2, 3, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1975</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, he overheard somebody saying, '<span class="SpellE">Patayin</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He beamed his flashlight towards the place
and saw Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maor</span> standing at the foot of the stairs some 8 meters
away from him (p. 4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two chased Nathaniel who, however, was
able to escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Nathaniel and his
relatives whose help he had sought returned to the place later, the assail­ants
were already gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They saw <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> and Romeo both critically wounded so they placed
them in hammocks and rushed them to the hospital at <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> (pp. 7, 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Romeo <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span> died five minutes
after his arrival at the hospital (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
April 4, 1975).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His mother <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> was treated of her hacked wounds on the head and
other parts of her body by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Leovegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Comia</span> who testified that had it not been for the emergency
surgical treatment administered to her, Alfonsa Patnon would have died (p. 8,
t.s.n., Ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfonsa was hospitalized
for two months and spent P1<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> for her
hospitalization (p. 24, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Feb. 13, 1975).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The body of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>
was autopsied by Municipal Health Officer Belen <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> who thereafter prepared the Necropsy Report
Exhi­bit 'L' (pp. 7-9, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1975</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'L', p. 28, rec.).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that prior to the incident in question, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span> instituted a land
case in court against <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Maor</span>
who is an uncle of the appellants (p. 13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Feb. 13, 1975)."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The PACADA brothers' defense, on the other hand, <span style="">is </span>one of denial and alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">AVELINO <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, 24, a farmer, married,
testified that at the time of the incident, he was at home praying with his
wife, two children, and a visitor; <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Gramo</span>, who corroborated his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their prayer and bible study lasted for three
hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="5">5:00 A.M.</st1:time>, he was likewise at home when
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Rotao</span> arrived and asked him for the
residence of his brother GREGORIO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the patrolman's instance, together they went to <span class="SpellE">GREGORIO's</span>
house.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, GREGORIO <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, 22, a
farmer, single, narrated that on <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1974</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 P.M.</st1:time>, he
was at home with his father, mother, brothers and sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not leave the house that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The following morning, his
brother AVELINO, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Rotao</span> and another
individual fetched him at his (<span class="SpellE">GREGORIO's</span>) house and
together, they all went to the house of the Barrio Captain where Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Dris</span> was present and was asked to identify him and his
brother as the assailants but Ofelia remained silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and his, <span class="GramE">brother were</span>
then <span style="">taken </span>to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> where they were
incarcerated for a week as the alleged authors of the crime and
investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they were
taken to the hospital where one of the victims, Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>,
<span style="">was confined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A</span> photograph was taken showing Alfonso
lying in bed and pointing to them as the culprits (Exhibit "B").<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">GREGORIO,</span> however
maintained that <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> was able to raise her hand to
point at him and his brother because her son Nathaniel, held her arm and pointed
it towards their direction.</p>

<p class="BODY">After assessing the evidence the Trial Court rendered judgment <span class="SpellE"><span style="">es</span></span><span style=""> </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>,
Sr. is hereby acquitted for insufficiency of evidence while accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Maur</span> is likewise acquitted on the ground of reason­able

Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span> are,
however, found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as defined
and penalized in Section 248 of the Revised Penal Code as principals by direct
participation, with the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident
premeditation and the attendant aggravating circumstances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and dwelling, without any miti­gating
circumstance, so that they should be as they are hereby sentenced to suffer the
capital punishment of DEATH and to indemnify the heirs of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span> in the sum of P12,000.00, without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of Insolvency, <span style="">in </span>view
of the nature of the principal penalty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Both accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, Jr.
and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span> are also
found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated murder as
defined and penalized in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to
Article 50 of the same Code, with the qualifying circumstances of treachery and
evident premeditation and aggravated by the circumstances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and dwelling, with no mitigating circumstance,
so they are accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of TWELVE (12) YEARS,
of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor, as to SEVENTEEN <span style="">(17) YEARS, </span>FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1)
DAY of reclusion temporal as maximum; and to indemnify the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, in the amount of
P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of in­solvency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are entitled to the full credit of their

in both cases.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon review of the
evidence, we find that the three (3) prose­cution witnesses, namely, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, the first victim
attacked, Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Dris</span>, her daughter-in-law, and
Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, her son, positive­ly and
satisfactorily identified appellants as the culprits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alfonsa</span></span><span style="">, who lived to tell her tale, testified that
she was in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of her house to verify the
identity of the two persons whom she saw running towards their <span class="SpellE">kitcken</span> when she was suddenly hacked by appellants on her
head and on different parts of her body severing a portion of her thumb; that
while she lay prostrate on the floor, appel­lants also attacked with their
bolos her son, Romeo, who came out of the room to help her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could identify appellants as she had
known them for approximately seven (7) years and the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
was illuminated be­cause of the lamp she had lit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Dris</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, Romeo's wife,
awakened by the destruction of part of the <span class="SpellE">buri</span> walls
of the house, also recognized appellants hack­ing her mother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span>, and later, her husband, Romeo, and terrified, she
jumped out of the window approximately four feet from the ground (Exhibit
"E") to call </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">help from her brothers-in-law Nathaniel and
Abraham whose houses were nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

someone on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alfonsa</span></span><span style="">, Ofelia, and Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>
knew appellants even before the incident, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> for
seven years, Ofelia for three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> and Ofelia knew the <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>

and Ofelia used to pass by the <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span> place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, AVELINO, himself testified that
his house was approximately half a kilo­meter from <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa's</span>;
that he knew <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> and her son Romeo for ten years,
and that when they (the <span class="SpellE">Pacadas</span>) started to reside in
the vicinity, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa's</span> family was already residing
thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span>,
Ofelia and Nathaniel could not have been mistaken in their identification of
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Rotao's</span>
testimony that Ofelia remained silent when he asked her to finger appellants is
contradicted by his earlier testimony that when he had interviewed her she said

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While it may be that the

<span class="SpellE">uno</span> <span class="SpellE">falsus</span> in

In fact, in respect of <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon's</span>

direct participation of accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jr</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span> has been sufficiently ventilated by the testimonies
of the victim herself, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>,
and that of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Dris</span>, both of whom saw and
witnessed both incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
testimony is almost flaw­less in important details and the Court is convinced
from their demeanor while testifying that they were telling the truth, so that
it is inevitable that they should be as they are hereby found guilty as charged

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is likewise
significant that early in the morning of the day after the incident the police
already invited appellants for questioning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That circumstance lends veracity to Abraham <span class="SpellE">Patnon's</span>
testimony that his brother Romeo, as he </span>lay wounded <span style="">after the assault, revealed to him </span>that
<span style="">the PACADA brothers were the authors of

insufficient, Nathaniel forthrightly sought help from the Provincial Fiscal<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>,
who thereupon asked the CIS through Agent Bernardo C. <span class="SpellE">Esquilona</span>,
to conduct the investigation and who thereafter took appel­lants to custody on
September 20, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These actuations
negate the de<span style="">fense contention that it
was merely "suspicion" that led to the "incarceration" of
appellants and resulted in their "identification" and event­ual
"conviction".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' defense of alibi must fail as it is overturned by
their positive identification by prosecution witnesses, who had known them for
several years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the governing
rule is that it is not enough to prove that the accused were somewhere else
when the crime was committed but it must likewise be demonstrated that it was
physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crime at the
time of its commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence discloses that appellant's homes

but the <span class="SpellE">Pacadas</span> took possession of the land<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Maur</span> erected a
house thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
And at one instance, <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> had stopped the <span class="SpellE">Pacadas</span> from cutting her bananas <span style="">on </span>the disputed property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even in the absence of a known motive, the time-honored rule is that
motive is not essential to convict when there is no doubt as to the identity of
the culprit.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the conclusion we draw from the evidence is that
appellants' identity and guilt have been proven to a moral certitude.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court correctly categorized the crimes as Murder and
Frustrated Murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, evident
premeditation was not attendant, absent proof of the following elements:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the time when the offender deter­mined'
to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit had
clung to its determination; and (3) sufficient time elapsed between the
determination and the execution to, allow him to reflect upon the consequences
of his act.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, treachery has to be taken into account since the attack
by appellants against the victims was sudden and unexpected in such a manner
that there was no risk to <span class="GramE">themselves</span> arising from the
defense the victims might put up.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span> and her son,
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Patnon</span>, were totally unprepared for the
surprise assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Barely had <span class="SpellE">Alfonsa</span> lighted the lamp in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
when she was hacked by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Romeo, roused from his sleep, unarmed and unaware, was next pounced upon
by them as he went out of his room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, treachery, which was alleged in the Information and duly proved,
qualifies the crimes to Murder and Frustrated Murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only the generic aggravating circumstance of dwelling may be
appreciated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nocturnity</span>
is inherent in treachery and cannot be separately considered.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The crime in Criminal Case No.</span> P-639 is
Murder, qualified by treachery, and attended by the aggravating circumstance of
dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With no mitigating
circumstance to off set the same, the maximum penalty provided in Article 248
of the Revised Penal Code is imposable upon each of the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, for lack of the required number of
votes to impose the capital punishment, the penalty should be commuted to <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The indemnification to be paid for the death of the victim should be
increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As recommended by the Solicitor General, the Court has opted to
reduce the penalty for the crime of Frustrated Murder for being too high.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment under review is hereby MODIFIED in
<span style="">that </span>(1) in Criminal Case No.
P-639 for Murder, the penalty is reduced <span style="">to
</span><u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, and the
indemnity for the death of the victim increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;
and (2) in Criminal Case No. P-640 for Frustrated Murder, the penalty is
reduced to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8)months and one (1)
day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as maximum.</p>
