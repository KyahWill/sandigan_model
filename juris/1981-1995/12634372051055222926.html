				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before this Court is a motion to declare respondent Judge
Rosarito F. Dabalos of the Regional Trial Court ("RTC"), Branch 2,
Butuan City, in contempt of court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 18 January 1991, the Court promulgated a decision in G.R. No.
78109 and G.R. No. 78179 dismissing the petitions for review and affirming the
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. No. 08-247.  This Court's resolution was held to be
immediately executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The execution of the final judgment, which included the
demolition of housing structures on the disputed property, was suspended by
respondent Judge Dabalos when two motions were filed by certain occupants of
Lot No. 447 (portion of the property in litigation), praying that the writ of
demolition should not be enforced against them since they were not parties to
the two cases and because Republic Act ("R.A.") No. 7279 (Urban
Development and Housing Act of 1992) declared a moratorium in the eviction and
demolition of dwellings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 October 1992, respondent Judge issued an order denying the
motions.  Later, however, respondent
judge relented and, evidently concerned about a possible transgression of
Section 28 of R.A. No. 7279, directed the sheriff not to resume the demolition
of the houses until after forty-five (45) days from receipt by the City Mayor
and the Sangguniang Panglunsod of Butuan City of a letter notifying them of the
pending demolition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apolinario Hidalgo filed a motion before respondent Judge to
declare in contempt of court the occupants of Lot No. 447.  Respondent Judge Dabalos did not act on the
motion because, he alleged, all concerned parties were not furnished with a
copy thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">During one of the hearings before the trial court, a verbal
argument ensued between petitioner's counsel and respondent Judge.  The latter thereupon inhibited himself from
further proceeding with the case not that, he said, he wanted to delay the
final disposition of the case but <span style="">because
</span>of the abusive and abrasive attitude of Hidalgo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein movant Apolinario Hidalgo, a private respondent in the
civil cases, now seeks to cite respondent Judge in contempt for misbehavior;
for having committed acts that impeded, obstructed and degraded the
administration of justice; and for violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion was referred by the Third Division of this Court to
the Office of the Court Administrator ("OCA") for evaluation, report
and recommendation.  <span style="">On </span>28 April 1994, OCA submitted its
report; it recommended <span style="">that respondent
Judge be exonerated from the contempt charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree.  Respondent Judge's actuations do not outrightly
evince any utter disregard of this Court's resolution.  Evidently, respondent Judge wanted to be
assured that the writ of demolition would not later have any serious legal
repercussion.  Indeed, ultimately,
respondent Judge resolved the question against the occupants of Lot No.
477.  His only basic error was his
impression on the applicability of R.A. 7279 to the case.  This law was enacted after the matter in
controversy had already been ruled upon with finality.  While, concededly, he committed a blunder,
there was nothing shown, however, to indicate that he acted in bad faith or was
improperly motivated.  He should,
therefore, be merely ADMONISHED for having failed to exercise that degree of
care required of any judge in the correct and prompt dispensation of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the instant motion to declare respondent
Judge Dabalos in contempt of court is DISMISSED but he is ADMONISHED to
hereafter exercise utmost prudence in the discharge of his office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
