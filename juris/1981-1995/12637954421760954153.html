<p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court, 
Branch XV, at Palo, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, finding appellant Emilio 
<span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
Murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <em>Reclusion Perpetua</em> 
and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> the sum of P12,000.00 and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant raised the following assignments of errors in this

PROSECUTION FAILED TO OVERCOME THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE OF THE 
ACCUSED;</blockquote>
<blockquote>C.<span>&nbsp; </span>THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING 
AS MERITORIOUS THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">All the assignments of errors center on whether or not the trial 
court erred in determining the credibility of the evidence presented and the 
weight to be given to it.</p>
<p class="BODY">We have held in a long line of cases that trial courts' findings 
of facts carry great weight for these <span>courts have the privilege of 
examining the deportment and demeanor of witnesses and, therefore, can discern 
if such witnesses are telling the truth or not.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>People v. 
Natipravat</em>, G.R. No. 69876, November 13, 1986; <em>People v. De Jesus</em>, 
G.R. Nos. 71942-43, November 13, 1986; <em>People v. Adones</em>, G.R. No. 
63453, September 24, 1986; <em>People v. Dondoy</em>, G.R. No. 63728, September 
15, 1986; and<em> People v. Patog</em>, G.R. No. 69620, September 24, 
1986).<span>&nbsp; </span>We have carefully examined the records and we find no 
reason to depart from the trial court's appreciation of the evidence of the 
prosecution and that of the defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The appellant tries to impeach the testimony of Antonio 
<span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, the lone prosecution witness by alleging 
conflicts of facts and inconsistencies in his statements.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
court, witness Antonio stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"A. <span>&nbsp; </span>When he left I closed my exit because I was 
already about to go to sleep when all of a sudden while I was already along the 
path I heard shout saying, '<span class="SpellE">Padi</span>, help me, I was 
wounded by Emilio.' Then I went out to verify.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Q <span>&nbsp; </span>When you went out to verify what did you find, 
what did you see?</blockquote>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A</span> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I helped my <span class="SpellE">pari</span> because he was already fallen to the ground and he was 
shouting for help.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q <span>&nbsp; </span>Who were the persons there when 
you arrived at the place where you saw your <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nobody</span> was there because 
he informed me that he ran.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q <span>&nbsp; </span>Who?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The person who wounded 
him."</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">(TSN, August 25, 1983, pp. 
6-7).</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Later on, Antonio affirmed an allegation in his affidavit that "x 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> there and then I 
immediately open (sic) my door and I saw Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> 
running on my yard towards the road bringing with him a short bolo approximately 
12 inches long more or less (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <em>supra</em>, p. 
9).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the course of </span>cross <span>examination, Antonio 
stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Is </span>it not a fact that you were only 
told that it was <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> who stabbed Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> as you said in your direct testimony <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> has <span>already ran away when you arrived at the 
victim, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"<span class="GramE">A</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was told by 
him.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> said, 'help me 
because I was wounded by Emilio'.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Actually you did not see Emilio delivered stab 
blows at Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> because according to you, you 
have only closed your door?</blockquote>
<blockquote>"A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not see because my doors were 
closed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear now that you only know that it was 
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> who stabbed <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> because <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> told you 
about that?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened to that lighted lamp which you gave 
to Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span>?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"<span class="GramE">A</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was thrown to 
the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And the light fell out?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, when you went out you could <span>not 
</span><span>see </span><span>anymore anybody because it </span><span>was 
dark?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span>(TSN., </span><em>supra</em>, pp. 
10-11).</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The appellant emphasizes his conclusion that in fact Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> was not a witness to the incident and therefore "the 
whole case for the prosecution immediately ends there, for there is no other 
piece of evidence for the prosecution on the identity of the perpetrator of the 
crime".</p>
<p class="BODY">The contradiction mentioned by the appellant is more apparent than 
real.<span>&nbsp; </span>The question of whether or not Antonio witnessed the 
stabbing incident was never in dispute.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court 
stated:</p>
<blockquote>"Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> admits that he did not see 
the incident but he only knew that Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> was 
the one who wounded Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> because the latter 
told him."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The statement by the deceased <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> was 
merely reinforced by the fact that Antonio saw the accused-appellant running 
away with a bolo in his hand from the place where <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> was found.<span>&nbsp; </span>On this point, the trial 
court stated that:</p>
<blockquote>"Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, uncle of the accused 
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, positively identified Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> running across the yard of Antonio's house just after 
the deceased Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> shouted for help because he 
was wounded by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The witness does not claim to have seen the actual stabbing.</p>
<p class="BODY">The appellant doubts if Antonio positively recognized the 
assailant because — (1) there was a lapse of a few minutes between the time he 
heard <span class="SpellE">Cañeda's</span> shouts and the time he opened the door 
and (2) the lamp he carried could not have sufficiently aided him in recognizing 
the assailant whom was 15 meters away from his house.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We agree with the Solicitor General that what bears emphasis 
is the testimony of Antonio regarding the time frame being assailed by the 
appellant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Antonio testified as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Q<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was that incident?</blockquote>
<blockquote>"A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he left I closed my exit because I was 
already about to go to sleep when all of a sudden while I was already 
<span>along the path I heard shout saying, '<span class="SpellE">Padi</span>, help 
me, I was wounded by Emilio'.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><em>Then I went out to 
verify</em>." <span>(<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> 
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span>(TSN., </span><em>supra</em>, <span>pp. 
6-7)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Antonio's reaction to the shouts of <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> was, therefore, immediate.<span>&nbsp; </span>This 
explains why he was able to see the accused <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> 
running away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Moreover, the records show that Antonio did not state that 
the assailant was 15 meters away from Antonio's house as assumed by the 
appellant but rather that it was the fallen body of <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> which was 15 meters away (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> </span><st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="8"><span>August 25, 1983</span></st1:date><span>, p. 
12).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The contradictions raised by the appellant do not merit 
serious consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The appellant also contends that it seems out of the 
ordinary that a person shouting under the circumstances of <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> at the time would mention both the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">christian</span></span> name and family name of 
the assailant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>This contention is untenable.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As held in the 
case of </span><em>People v. Quinlob</em> <span>(119 SCRA 
130):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span>An ulterior motive has been imputed against Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> for testifying against his nephew, appellant Emilio 
<span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The latter believes that 
Antonio, brother of his father, <span class="SpellE">Senando</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, testified against him because of a dispute over 
their inheritance which his uncle refused to give to <span class="SpellE">Senando's</span> family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The lower court did not err in ruling that such a theory 
does not inspire belief considering the admission of the accused that it is 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> who is in possession of the land 
alluded to by the appellant as their inheritance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As correctly pointed out by the Solicitor 
General:<span>&nbsp; </span>"If there is anybody who should feel aggrieved, it is the 
accused himself, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, not Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, because it was the former who felt dispossessed of 
what he claims to be rightfully his".</span></p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it is the appellant who possesses a 
motive.<span>&nbsp; </span>The records show that about two years before the stabbing 
incident, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> was stabbed by Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span>, the son of the deceased Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled rule that motive is essential for conviction 
only when there is doubt as to the identity of the culprit or where there are no 
eyewitnesses and where suspicion is likely to fall upon a number of persons 
(<em>People v. Manalo</em>, 135 SCRA 84).<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, there can be no 
doubt about the guilt of the appellant in the face of the prosecution evidence 
clearly and sufficiently warranting his conviction namely that the deceased 
<span class="SpellE">Cañeda</span> named him as his assailant, he was seen running 
away from the scene of the crime, and he had a motive to commit the crime.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED with the
