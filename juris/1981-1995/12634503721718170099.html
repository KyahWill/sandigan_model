				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the legality of the additional one-half
percent (1/2%) realty tax imposed by the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 64 of the Revised Charter of Manila, Republic Act No.
409, which took effect on <st1:date year="1949" day="18" month="6">June 18,
 1949</st1:date>, fixes the annual realty tax at one and one-half percent
(1-1/2%).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, section 4 of the Special Education Fund Law,
Republic Act No. 5447, which took effect on January 1, 1969, imposed "an
annual additional tax of one <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> on the assessed value of
real property in addition to the real property tax regularly levied thereon
under existing laws" but "the total real property tax shall not
exceed a maximum of three <u>per</u> <u>centum</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY">That maximum limit gave the municipal board of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
the idea of fixing the realty tax at <u>three percent</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, by means of Ordinance No. 7125, approved
by the city mayor on <st1:date year="1971" day="26" month="12">Decem­ber 26,
 1971</st1:date> and effective beginning the third quarter of 1972, the board
imposed an <u>additional one-half percent realty tax</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ordinance reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An additional annual realty tax of one-half
percent (1/2%), or in short a total of <u>three percent (3%) realty tax</u>
(1-1/2% pursuant to the Revised Charter of Manila; 1% per Republic Act No.
5447; and 1/2% per this Ordinance) on the assessed value x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> is hereby levied and imposed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Philippines, Inc. paid under
protest the sum of P16<span class="GramE">,092.69</span> as additional one-half
percent realty tax for the third quarter of 1972 on its land and machineries
located in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1972</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Esso</span> filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance
of Manila for the recovery of the said amount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It contended that the additional one-half percent tax is void because it
is not authorized by the city charter <span class="GramE">nor</span> by any law
(Civil Case No. 88827).</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the trial court declared the tax ordinance void
and ordered the city treasurer of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to refund to <span class="SpellE">Esso</span> the said tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and its treasurer appealed to this Court under Republic Act No. 5440 (which
superseded Rule 42 of the Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue is the validity of the tax ordinance or the
legality of the additional one-half percent realty tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in their manifestation of March 17, 1981 averred
that the said tax ordinance is still in force; that Ordi­nance No. 7566, which
was enacted on September 10, 1974, imposed a two percent tax on commercial real
properties (like the real properties of <span class="SpellE">Esso</span>) and
that that two percent tax plus the one percent tax under the Special Education
Fund Law gives a total of three percent realty tax on commercial properties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Philippines, Inc., now <span class="SpellE">Petrophil</span> Corporation, in its manifestation of <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1981</st1:date>, revealed that up to
this time it has been paying the additional one-half percent tax and that from
1975 to 1980 it paid the total sum of P4<span class="GramE">,206,240.71</span> as
three percent tax on its real properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it is relevant to note that section 39(2) of
the Real Property Tax Code, Presidential Decree No. 464, which took effect on
June 1, 1974, provides that a city council may, by ordinance, impose a realty tax
"of not less than one-half of one percent but not more than <u>two percent</u>
of the assessed value of real property".</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 41 of the said Code reaffirms the one percent tax on real
property for the Special Education Fund in addition to the basic two percent
realty tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">So, there is no question now that the additional one-half percent
realty tax is valid under the Real Property Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is in controversy is the legality of the
additional one-half percent realty tax for the two-year period from the third
quarter of 1972 up to the second quarter of 1974.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the doctrine of implications in statutory
construction sustains the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>'s
contention that the additional one-half percent realty tax is sanctioned by the
pro­vision in section 4 of the Special Education Fund Law that "the total
real property tax shall not exceed a maximum of three <u>per centum</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of implications means that "that which is
plainly implied in the language of a statute is as much a part of it as that
which is expressed" (<u>In re</u> McCulloch Dick, 38 Phil. 41, 45, 90; 82
C.J.S. 632; 73 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2nd 404).</p>

<p class="BODY">While the 1949 Revised Charter of Manila fixed the realty tax at
one and a half percent, on the other hand, the 1968 Special Education Fund Law
definitively fixed three percent as the <u>maximum</u> real property tax of
which one percent would accrue to the Special Education Fund.</p>

<p class="BODY">The obvious implication is that an additional one-half percent
tax could be imposed by municipal corporations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inferentially, that law fixed at <u>two percent</u> the realty tax that
would accrue to a city or municipality.</p>

<p class="BODY">And the fact that the 1974 Real Property Tax Code specifically
fixes the real property tax at <u>two percent</u> con­firms the prior intention
of the lawmaker to impose <u>two per­cent as the realty tax proper</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was also the avowed in­tention of the
questioned ordinance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In invalidating the ordinance, the trial court upheld the view of
<span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Philippines, Inc. that the Special Education
Fund Law refers to a contingency where the application of the addi­tional one
percent realty tax would have the effect of raising the total realty tax to
more than three percent and that it cannot be construed as an authority to
impose an additional realty tax beyond the one percent fixed by the said law.</p>

<p class="BODY">At first glance, that appears to be a specious or reason­able
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the fact remains that
the city charter fixed the realty tax at 1-1/2% and the later law, the Special
Education Fund Law, provides for <u>three percent</u> as the maximum realty tax
of which one percent would be earmarked for the education fund.</p>

<p class="BODY">The unavoidable inference is that the later law authorized the
imposition of an additional one-half percent realty tax since the contingency
referred to by the complaining taxpayer would not arise in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, as contended by the taxpayer, that the power of a
municipal corporation to levy a tax should be expressly granted and should not
be merely inferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in this case,
the power to impose a realty tax is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is disputed is the <u>amount thereof</u>,
whether one and one-half percent only or two percent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See sec. 2 of Rep. Act No.
2264.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As repeatedly observed, section 4 of the Special Educa­tion Fund
Law, as confirmed by the Real Property Tax Code, in prescribing a total realty
tax of three percent impliedly authorizes the augmentation by one-half percent
of the pre­-existing one and one-half percent realty tax.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court is reversed and
set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint of <span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Philippines, Inc. for recovery of the realty tax paid
under protest is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
