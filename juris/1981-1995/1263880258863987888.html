BIGALBAL HAS NOT <span style="">BEEN </span>ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 46-b)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the first assignment of error, the appellant contends that <span class="SpellE">Agustina's</span> allegation that she was forcibly taken by <span class="SpellE">Hayag</span>, Arenas and Serrano is unbelievable considering that
there was a wedding preparation going on and it was impossible for her
relatives not to see these three accused forcibly taking her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds the appellant's argument unmeritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that<i> </i>her relatives
went inside the aunt's house and she was left alone in the terrace when <span class="SpellE">Hayag</span>, Arenas and Serrano arrived (TSN, pp. 6-7, September
11, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">explains why none of the victim's relatives witnessed her abduction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bigalbal</span></span><span style=""> likewise maintains that <span class="SpellE">Agustina's</span>
testimony that she was dragged for one hour up to the "<span class="SpellE">bajada</span>"
defies credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He points out that
if she was indeed dragged for almost an hour, then there should have been
bruises on her hands and arms but surprisingly, the medico-legal report did not
disclose </span>any unusual finding of medical significance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On this issue, we quote
with approval the observation of the Solicitor General:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Appellant makes much importance to
(sic) the word 'dragged'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
clear in the records whether or not the word 'dragged' reflects the correct
translation into the English language when complainant, who was testifying in
the local dialect, testified as to the manner she was forcibly taken out of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is still possible that
somebody may be 'dragged' while still capable of walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances of the instant case,
rape can still be committed without unusual significant marks on the victim's
neck, legs, thighs, hands or arms." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
91)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover,
</span><span style="">the psychiatric report on the
victim (Exhibit "C", Original Records; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 21-24) shows that the victim is suffering from moderate mental
retardation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>
stated that she was dragged from her aunt's house to the "<span class="SpellE">bajada</span>" for an hour.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But when asked how long an hour is, she replied, "It was </span>a <span style="">long time" and when asked if she knows
how many minutes there are in an hour, she answered, "No, Sir, I do not
know" </span>(TSN, page 16, September 11, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ocular <span style="">inspection report of the crime scene (Exhibit 3, Records, page 64)
indicates that it took only ten minutes ordinary walk from the house of the
victim's aunt to the "<span class="SpellE">bajada</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore possible that her claim that
she was "dragged" <u>for</u> <u>an</u> <u>hour</u> is <span class="GramE">incorrect,</span> grounded on a distorted perception of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even assuming that there
really were no physical injuries inflicted, the absence of such injuries does
not negate the commission of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">(See People </span><span style="">v. <span class="SpellE">Abonada</span>, 169
SCRA 530 [1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Mustacisa</span>, 159 SCRA 227
[1988]; People v. Alfonso, 153 SCRA </span><span style="">487 [1987].</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant attempts to highlight other <span style="">inconsistencies in <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>’ testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He directs this Court's attention to her previous statement that she was
raped by accused <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span>
(TSN, page 38, September 11, 1989) and her later claim that <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span>
only held her hands (TSN, page 40, September 11, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This apparent conflict may be reconciled by
the fact that the appellant, being moderately mentally retarded, has, every now
and then, a different grasp of the question propounded to her and is confused
as to the meaning of rape:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> also raped you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know what <span class="GramE">is the meaning of rape</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
does it mean?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
kissed me and put <span style="">kiss </span>marks on
my neck.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
is what you know about rape?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
do you<span style=""> </span>mean when you said you were raped?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If I </span>was raped I got pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, p. 36, September 11, 1989)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court finds, however,
that the complainant is nonetheless consistent i</span>n <span style="">her testimony with respect to the identity of
those accused <span class="GramE">who</span> had carnal knowledge with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant moreover
challenges the truth of the victim's statement that while <span class="SpellE">Hayag</span>,
Serrano and Arenas took turns in raping her, Vic <span class="SpellE">Hayag</span>
poked an <span class="SpellE">icepick</span> at her right waist while the appellant,
<span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> took turns
holding her hands and feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Almario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bigalbal</span> reasons that
there simply was no need for him to hold the hands of the complainant since <span class="SpellE">Hayag</span> was already poking an <span class="SpellE">icepick</span>
at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court does not agree with
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>
testified </span><span style="">that </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Hayag</span></span><span style=""> poked the <span class="SpellE">icepick</span>
at her right waist to keep her from shouting and despite the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">icepick</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
she was </span><span style="">still </span><span style="">struggling (TSN, p. 10, September 5</span>, <span style="">1989).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was therefore necessary for the appellant and the other accused to
hold her hands and feet in order to facilitate the consummation of the rape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> kept silent for two days before revealing the </span>rape
<span style="">to her mother does not diminish the
reliability of her testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
silence was rooted on her fear for her life since she was warned, at the </span><span style="">risk </span><span style="">of being killed, not to tell anybody about the rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering her mental state, such threat
produced an overpowering effect on the victim, sufficient to conceal her ordeal
from her relatives until she was grilled by her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Manaay</span>, 151 <span style="">SCRA 31 </span>[1987]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>retrospect, the appellant's assigned errors principally relate to
the credibility of the rape victim, <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the issue
of credibility of witnesses, the Court </span><span style="">has </span><span style="">always stressed that
findings of the lower court </span><span style="">are </span><span style="">accorded great weight and are not to </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">disturbed unless the court overlooked certain facts of substance and
value that, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>, <span class="GramE">173<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SCRA</span> 684 [1989];
People v. <span class="SpellE">Baysa</span>, 172 SCRA 706 [1989]; Aguirre v. <span class="GramE">People, 155 SCRA 337 [1987]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the probative value
of the complainant's testimony, the lower court made the following observation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The manner in which she answered the
questions propounded (sic) to her on direct examinations and cross
examinations, her obvious sincerity and readiness to disclose the facts injured
(sic) of her of course characterized boldness when she identified and pointed
to <span class="SpellE">Almario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagalbal</span> with
tears flowing from her eyes impressed the court with truthfulness of her
testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Original Records, pp.
86-87)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other </span><span style="">hand, with </span><span style="">respect to the credibility of the appellant, the </span><span style="">lower </span><span style="">court had this to say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Accused <span class="SpellE">Almario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bigalbal's</span> demeanor on
the witness stand and each time that he was in Court during the hearing of this
case denied credence of (sic) his story.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He appeared to the Court as one who does not appreciate the gravity of
the offense imputed against him, to whatever penalty may be imposed upon
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unconvinced (should be unconcerned)
demeanor of the accused on the witness stand as if the crime is not serious
gives an impression of incredibility to his defense to the rape charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Marbebe</span>,
128 SCRA 537).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Original Records, p. 89)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We defer to the <span style="">foregoing
</span>findings of the lower court which, <span style="">having
had </span>the <span style="">opportunity to assess
the behavior of the witnesses, </span>gave more <span style="">credence to <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> Arenas' testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The other inconsistencies
in <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>' testimony that are adduced </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the appellant are minor contradictions that do not detract from her
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Velasco, 175
SCRA 442 [1989]) Besides, the Court cannot expect a rape victim to recall every
sordid detail of her traumatic experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant was positively identified by the <span style="">victim as one of those who held her hands
while she was being raped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there
is no evidence to show that the victim, </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">a </span><span style="">19-year
old moderately mentally retarded provincial lass</span></span><span style="">, was actuated by improper motives, her
identification of the accused as one of the culprits should be given full faith
and credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See
People v. Aragon, 164 SCRA 78 [1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span>,
150 SCRA 113 [1987]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant's defense
of alibi cannot likewise prevail over positive identification by the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People
v. <span class="SpellE">Demecillo</span>, 186 SCRA 161 [1990]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the appellant
has not shown that it was physically impossible for the accused to be present
at the crime scene or at the vicinity thereof at the approximate time the crime
was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Alejo</span> <span class="SpellE">C<span style="">uyo</span></span></span> <span style="">y <span class="SpellE">Mortero</span> and Felix <span class="SpellE">Buen</span> y <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, G.R.

<p class="BODY">In a final attempt to exculpate himself, the appellant presented <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> Arenas whose testimony suggested that the
complainant voluntarily went with <span class="SpellE">Hayag</span>, Arenas and
Serrano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, pp. 9-11, October 6,
1989) The Court however doubts the veracity of <span style="">Arenas' </span>statement considering that he <span style="">is </span>the father of one <span style="">of </span>the
accused, Frankie, who is still at large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the defense has not presented any evidence to show that <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> is a woman of ill-repute or of a flirtatious and
wanton nature to incite or provoke <span class="SpellE">Hayag</span>, Arenas and
Serrano to have sexual intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(See People v. <span style="">Pena,
</span>Jr., <span style="">151 SCRA 638 [1987].</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, the psychiatric </span><span style="">r</span><span style="">eport on the victim portrayed her as an
emotionally inhibited and socially sensitive and critical person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit C, Original Records; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. <span style="">23)<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot <span style="">o</span>verlook
the fact that <span class="GramE">all the</span> appellant's co-accused have
remained in hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has always
repeated that flight of an accused signifies an awareness of <span style="">gui</span>lt and a consciousness that he has
no tenable defense to the rape charge (See People <span style="">v. </span>Dante <span class="SpellE">Bartulay</span>, G.R. No. 83696,
December 21, 1990; <span style="">People </span>v. <span class="SpellE">Tangliben</span>, 184 SCRA <span style="">220 </span>[1990]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, 172 SCRA 149 [1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Avero</span>,
165 SCRA 130 [1988]). The disappearance of the five accused lends credence to <span class="SpellE">Agustina's</span> charge of rape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the appellant did not take flight, he was nevertheless positively
identified by <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As previously mentioned,
the rest of the accused were never charged and arraigned before the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without necessarily prejudging
their cases until </span>jurisdiction over them is acquired and their
respective defenses are thereafter presented, the Court nevertheless finds that
the commission of rape <span style="">has </span>been
established beyond reasonable doubt and that appellant<span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Bigalbal's</span> participation therein is
undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records, however, do not
clearly indicate that <span class="SpellE">Bigalbal</span> participated in <u>all</u>
<u>the</u> </span><u><span style="">three</span></u><span style=""> <u>rap</u></span><u><span style="">es</span></u><span style=""> allegedly
committed upon the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, the Court holds that the appellant may </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">found guilty, as co­-conspirator and principal, of only one count of
rape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That conspiracy
accompanied the commission of rape is borne out by the evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The combined actuations <span style="">of all </span>the accused, including the
appellant, indicate a common design to </span>commit the crime of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the appellant himself did not have
carnal knowledge of the victim, his tacit and spontaneous cooperation by
holding her hands, instead of preventing the <span class="GramE">rape,</span>
makes him a co-conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such he
becomes a principal in the commission of rape.</p>
