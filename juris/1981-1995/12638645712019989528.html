Commission wherein the termination of the private respondent was declared
illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">The antecedent </span>facts
of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Reynaldo J. <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
was employed by petitioner company as a medical representative for the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete/Bohol</span> area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As such, his duty was to conduct sales calls on physicians within his
territory and providing the latter with drug samples on dates specified by the
company so as to create a promotional impact for the products of Roche.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the nature of the work of medical
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">representatives </span>like <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> requires <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">that
</span>they go out in the field for most of the day, the company is unable to
monitor their work hours through the <span class="SpellE">bundy</span> clock
system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the company devised a
method whereby the day to day activities of these employees could nevertheless
be checked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were required to fill
out daily call reports indicating the names of physicians visited for a
particular day and the drug samples issued to the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each doctor was also to sign an acknowledgement
of receipt of the drug samples indicating the date of each visit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1982</st1:date>,
petitioner Jerry <span class="SpellE">Losbanes</span> supervisor of Roche <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(Phil.) for </span>the <st1:place>East-West <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span></st1:place> area, wrote the private respondent
informing the latter of a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>report
filed by Johnny de la Cruz, its marketing manager for Bulk Vitamins.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. de la Cruz had allegedly seen Villarreal

on <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1982</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">when the latter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">was </span>supposed to have been in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">stated </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span>his assigned itinerary and as
declared by him in his Daily Call Report for that particular day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accusing <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
of "kiting" as the aforesaid practice is called, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">petitioner </span><span class="SpellE">Losbanes</span>
directed the former to explain in writing why he should not be recommended for
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Realizing the gravity of such
accusation, <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> immediately complied with the
said directive by submitting his answer on September 23.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the said answer, he emphatically denied
the charges hurled at him and added that in all his fourteen years of service
to the company, not once had he indulged in the abhorred practice of
"kiting." He then invited the company to conduct an investigation of
the matter and even submitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>certification
from 26 physicians covered by him on the 9th and 10th of September 1982, to
prove that he was in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental performing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>duties and not in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City as claimed by Mr. de la Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pending investigation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>case, <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
was suspended by the company for an indefinite period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without conducting any hearing whatsoever, <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
was notified in writing of his dismissal from the service on <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1982</st1:date> by petitioners <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dortsman</span> for allegedly
falsifying his Daily Call Report for <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His dismissal was
to take effect on the 27th of the same month.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hoping to present his side and in an attempt to change the
verdict reached by the petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> sought
out the latter on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1982</st1:date>
at the Montebello Hotel in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>where they were having a
meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, his pleas fell on deaf
ears inasmuch as the petitioners refused to speaks with him and curtly advised
him that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>dismissal was a
closed matter as far as the company was concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he was asked to turn over all
company assets <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>his
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He complied with the
instructions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, the company required him to sign a
letter-quitclaim as a condition for the issuance of a certificate of
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This request was followed by
several checks issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> which
purport to show that the company had already settled its obligation with
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A letter accompanying the said
checks stated that "while accepting the above payments, you confirm that
you have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">no claims </span>whatsoever,
to presents against Roche (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Inc. </span>in relation to your activity with
this Company or otherwise."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, private respondent rejected
the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Realizing that there was no other way for him to clear his name, <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> was prompted to seek redress by filing a
complaint with the National Labor Relation Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Included in his complaint for illegal dismissal was his claim for 50% of the
savings obtained by the company from the cost-savings plan which he had devised
for the latter in response to an inter-office memorandums dated <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1977</st1:date>, encouraging all
employees of Roche to come up with cost-savings proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">memorandums </span>guaranteed an incentive of 50% share in any amount
saved during the first<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> 12 </span>months
of the implementation of the approved proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent claims that the petitioner company adopted his
proposals but the promised 50% share was never given to him despite repeated
demands.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due consideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of
the </span>evidence brought before him, the labor arbiter held<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that the company was guilty of illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was ordered to pay the complainant unpaid
salaries, <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, 13th month pay along with other
benefits and allowances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the event
that <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> opted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">to </span>retire, the company was ordered to pay him his retirement
benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Damages amounting to P155,000.00
were also awarded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Petitioners interposed an
appeal with the respondent National Labor Relations Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It proved to be futile <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">since </span>the appeal was dismissed for
lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision appealed
from was affirmed, albeit with certain modifications, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portions of which reads, thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">"The respondents are hereby ordered:</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds the petition bereft of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners insist <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>they
have gathered sufficient evidence to dismiss <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
for "kiting" through falsifications of his Daily Call Report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To bolster this allegation they presented the
testimony of Johnny de la Cruz who had allegedly seen <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He averred that <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
greeted him with the following statement:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Sir, I'm coming in from <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>
City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I am not supposed to be officially
in yet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sir, don't tell them that you
saw me."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Suspecting that something was irregular, de la Cruz allegedly checked the Daily
Call Report filed by <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> for the said date and
discovered that the latter reported that he was in <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>
at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances,
according to petitioners, clearly justify the termination of <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> from employment because of "kiting."</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds the above-mentioned testimony doubtful.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, it is unlikely that <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>,
upon seeing an executive of the company, would go out of his way to confess his
misdeed especially to one he hardly knows, having met the latter only
once.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This kind of behavior runs
contrary to ordinary experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it
was true that <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> was in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on that day, it would have been more natural for him to take all precautions to
avoid being seen by anyone from the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Or if he was actually seen he would have kept mum about his infraction
of the rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, it cannot be denied that Roche (Phil.) is a big
organization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It employs a great number
of medical representatives to promote its products.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it appears improbable that De la Cruz
would have been able to identify <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> when the
latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>not even under his
direct supervision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He met him only once
and casually.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, assuming <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">Villareal</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> was seen </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City
at the time and he informed de la Cruz that he just arrived from <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>, if so then he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">was </span>not “kiting.” His violation, if at all, is that he returned
too soon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>denying that they have
deprived the right of <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> to due process, the
petitioners pointed out that he was informed of the charges against him and he
was given the opportunity to explain his side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Citing <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Associated </span>Citizen’s
</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Banks <span class="SpellE">vs</span>

substantiate their arguments by mentioning that this Court had previously done
away with the holding of a hearing in order to comply with the constitutional
requirement of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the circumstances obtaining in the above-cited case
bears no resemblance to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">former </span>contemplate a
situation where the employee admits his guilt and all his admissions are
corroborated by documentary evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such is not the case in the present controversy where <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> never admitted the commission of the offense he
has being charged of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records do not
indubitably show that <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> was actually in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City on that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A hearing was, therefore, necessary to thresh out all doubts as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>the conflicting allegation of De la
Cruz <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure of petitioner to give private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">respondent the </span>benefit of a hearing
and an investigation before his termination constitutes an infringement of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">his </span>constitutional right to due process
of law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners next assail the legality of the order of
reinstatement made by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>respondent
commission by citing <u>San </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Miguel

whenever the termination of an employee was due to breach of trust and
confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quoting certain passages
from the decision of this Court in the subsequent case of <span class="SpellE"><u>W</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">enphil</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Corporation vs. NLRC </span>and <span class="SpellE">Millarre</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioners tried to buttress this line of reasoning by stating that the
termination of an employee was proper since "it would be highly
prejudicial to the interests of the employer to impose on him the services of
an employee who <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">has been shown to be
guilty </span>of the charges that warranted his dismissal from employment</u>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Again, an examination of the facts in the above cited <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cases </span>shows that these two cases bear

the employee was dismissed for his insubordination since he had flagrantly

</span>The said funds were disbursed by the company to be used in posting bail
for the said employee when the latter was criminally charged with damage to
property through reckless imprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the dismissal of the case, the employee deposited the cash bond in
his account instead of returning the said amount to the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No reasonable explanation was given by him
when confronted by his superiors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the gravity of the offenses, taken together with the
evidence presented against the said employees, this Court found their dismissal
to be proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">But such is not the case with <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
wherein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the very </span>credibility of
the only witness against him is put in issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> had served the company
for fourteen years with nary a complaint from his superiors such that an
offense like "kiting" would not have merited such a drastic
punishment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>dismissal; that
is, if he were really guilty of the said offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the failure of the petitioner to prove
such fact "<u>necessarily means that the dismissals is not justified,</u>
and, therefore, the employee is entitled to be reinstated in accordance with
the mandate of Article 280 of the New Labor Code."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequent pronouncements of this Court reiterate this doctrine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dabuet</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Roches</span> Pharmaceuticals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that reinstatement must follow as a matter of right whenever
the management has been found guilty of illegal dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having established the impropriety of the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>, thus requiring his consequent reinstatement, the
question as to his entitlement to retirement benefits arises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The collective bargaining agreement entered into between the
management and the union provides for an optional retirement program for
employees who have been with the company for fifteens (15) consecutive
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The company undertook to pay the
basic pay for one month multiplied by the number of years the employee has
served the company for the first 15 years and a month and a half's basic salary
for every year for the subsequent years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions of the collective bargaining agreement must be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respected since </span>its terms and
conditions "constitute the law between the parties." Those who are
entitled to its benefits can invoke its provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the event that an obligations therein
imposed is not fulfilled, the aggrieved party <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">has </span>the right to go to court for redress.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue is whether or not <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
is entitled to be paid the cost saving bonus of 50% of the amount saved by the
company for the year that his proposal was implemented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This time the Court resolves the issue in the
negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners allege that the inter-office memorandum upon which <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> bases his claim was not in effect when the latter
submitted his proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also
ask why Villarreal tarried for such a long time before filing the said claim if
he honestly believed that he was entitled to the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners further aver that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">even </span>if <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
was legally entitled to the said bonus, prescription has set in under Article
291 of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned
article provides that "all money claims arising from employer-employee
relations accruing during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this
Code shall be filed within three (3) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">years
</span>from the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>time the cause
of action accrued, otherwise, they shall be forever barred."</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court cannot allow <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> to
recover said claim at this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">late </span>time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He should have filed his claims against Roche
the moment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">his </span>cause of action
accrued instead of waiting for five years before doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had, therefore, slept on his rights and should
not be rewarded for his own negligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On this aspect, the Court must hold for the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners then suggest that the respondent Commission abused
its discretion in awarding <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> in excess of those
stated in the decision of the labor arbiter despite the absence of an appeal by
<span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
stress this point, they cited Section 5(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the
National Labor Relations Commission which provides that the Commission shall,
in cases of perfected appeals, limits itself to reviewing those issues which
were raised on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
those which were not raised on appeal shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in this contention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that the petitioners
elevated the issues regarding the correctness of the award of damages,
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>, retirement benefits and
the cost-saving bonus to the respondent Commission in their appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This opened the said issues for review and
any action taken thereon by the Commission was well within the parameters of
its jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the propriety of the award of moral damages, this
Court, in a long line of cases, has consistently granted the lowly workingman
the right to recover damages for unjust dismissals tainted with bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant petition, the motive of the
company <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>dismissing <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> was far from noble as borne by the circumstances
surrounding such dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners must have known that <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>,
who had been their employee for fourteen (14) years, had only one year to serve
before he could avail of the benefits of the optional retirement plan
stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the latter would be receiving a
considerable sum of money from the company and the only way they could avoid
this obligation was to find a reason, no matter how flimsy, to terminate the
employment of <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conveniently, indeed, petitioners discovered
that <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> was "kiting" and <span class="SpellE">outrightly</span> dismissed him on the basis of the
unsubstantiated allegations of one person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their bad faith was made more apparent by their refusal to conduct a
formal investigation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">give </span><span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
an opportunity to traverse the charges against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the respondent Commission
regarding the award of damages plus ten percent (10%) of the entire monetary
award <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">must, therefore, be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Lastly, the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> awarded </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">to </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Villareal</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> should not </span>exceed three (3) years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, with the modification eliminating the award
for cost saving bonus and that the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should
