				<H3>SPOUSES DONATO RAMIREZ AND MARIA RAMIREZ, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PINAMALAYAN, ORIENTAL MINDORO AND IGMEDIO REYES, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MEDIALDEA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The land in question is a 1,200 meters long and 15 meters wide
strip of land denominated as the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Malitbog-Naksib</span>
  <span class="SpellE">Narra</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> and situated
in <span class="SpellE">Bongabong</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was donated sometime in 1923 by the
predecessor-in-interest of herein private respondent <span class="SpellE">Igmedio</span>
Reyes to the government for the construction and utilization thereof as
provincial-municipal road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
government failed to construct a road or at least improve the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So on <st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="10">October
 9, 1959</st1:date>, the donor in writing, revoked the donation on the ground
that the purpose for which the <span class="GramE">donation</span> was made was
never pursued.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1960, the government appropriated another strip of land from
the titled property of the private respondent and thereupon, constructed the
present and existing <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Malitbog-Naksib</span>
  <span class="SpellE">Narra</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, in government forms, the government
and private respondent executed Road Right of Way Agreements (Petition, Annex
"D" and Annex "F," <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
27-30 and 39-42) whereby the originally donated strip of land was exchanged
with the strip of land where the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Malitbog-Naksib</span>
  <span class="SpellE">Narra</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> was
constructed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the execution of the two (2) Road Right of Way Agreements,
private respondent tried to take possession of the exchanged area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioners, together with others
were found in actual possession and cultivation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, private respondent instituted Civil
Case No. <span class="GramE">R-184 for Recovery of Ownership and Possession at
the then Court of First Instance of Oriental </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Mindoro</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE">, Branch II at <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants therein, now petitioners,
interposed the defense that they are:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in rightful possession and
occupation of the abandoned proposed road that adjoins their parcels of land
either as <span class="SpellE">reparian</span> (sic) owners or to compensate them
or a exchange for separate portions of their parcels of land which were
traversed by the <span class="SpellE">Miaje</span> <span class="SpellE">Sigañgi</span>
road constructed by the government x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Answer filed in Civil Case No. R-184, Annex
"3," <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 338)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In the course of the pre-trial proceedings in
Civil Case No.</span> R-184, petitioners, with some of the other defendants,
manifested that they are no longer interested in the land subject matter of
this case so that they were indeed dropped from the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the court in that case
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"That per conference with the defendants <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Casao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Ramirez, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>, Marina <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and the
Highway District Engineer, they are no longer interested in the land subject
matter of this case so that he is agreeable that said defendants be dropped
from the case." <span class="GramE">(p. 3, Decision, Civil Case No.</span>
R-184, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 33)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="2">February
 9, 1976</st1:date> became final as no appeal by any of the parties thereto was
ever interposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it had been
fully executed complied with and satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot, however, be enforced against petitioner herein who were
dropped as parties as they promised to vacate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1978</st1:date>,
private respondent filed another suit for recovery of ownership and possession
against petitioners in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-540.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After service of summons, petitioners filed their answer in court
but never furnished any copy of such answer to private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, on the scheduled pre-trial
conference, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Ramirez failed to
appear, although his wife, Maria Ramirez appeared and informed the trial court
that her husband is not available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
by reason of the failure to furnish private respondent with a copy of an answer
and to appear during the pre-trial conference, private respondent moved for the
declaration of petitioners in default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court resolved to grant the motion and declared petitioners in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite receipt of a copy of
the order by petitioners on <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="6">June 30,
 1980</st1:date>, they did not ask to set aside the order of default nor did
they seek any relief from said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">After presentation of <span style="">evidence
<u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, </span>the trial court
rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1982</st1:date>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“(a) Ordering the defendant to surrender the possession of the land
in question in favor of <span class="SpellE">Igmedio</span> Reyes, with a length
of 1,200 meters and with a width of 15 meters of the abandoned old <span class="SpellE">Malitbog-Naksib</span> Road pursuant to the Road Right of Way
Agreement for National Road, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A";<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) Ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,500</span> yearly from the year 1966 up to the present;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c) Ordering the defendant to pay the attorney's fees in the
amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(d) Ordering the defendant to pay the costs of
this suit.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 46-47)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment, petitioners filed an ordinary appeal before
the then Intermediate Appellate Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This appeal docketed as AC G.R. CV No. 04164, however, was dismissed
when petitioners failed to file appellants' brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order dismissing the appeal became final
and entry of judgment was issued on <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="4">April
 2, <span style="">1985</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of private respondent, a motion for writ of execution
was issued on <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prevent the implementation of the writ,
petitioners instituted on June 10, 1985 before the Regional Trial Court of
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, Civil Case No. 770 for annulment of
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This complaint was dismissed
for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1985</st1:date>,
the Deputy Sheriff of the trial court levied properties of petitioners and by
notice of sheriff's sale dated <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="8">August
 7, 1985</st1:date> published the said notice of auction sale for <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of sheriff's sale was published in
a newspaper of general circulation on September 2, 9 and 16, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioners filed again before the then Intermediate Appellate Court another
annulment suit docketed as CA G.R. No. <span class="GramE">SP 07107.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this annulment suit, petitioners filed before the trial court an urgent
motion for a stay of the implementation of the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners succeeded in securing <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1985</st1:date> an order granting the motion to stay
the writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="10">October 1,
 1985</st1:date>, the trial court issued an amended order, worded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the interest of justice considering that Notice of Auction
Sale had already been published in the newspaper prescribed by law, the auction
sale of the levied properties of the defendant is hereby re-scheduled on
October 29, 1985, at 10:00 o'clock in the morning without the necessity of
republication since it was defendant who sought the postponement of said
auction sale on September 25, 1985.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Petition, Annex "K," <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 57)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration of the order rescheduling auction
sale without republication was denied by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, a notice of appeal from said orders as
well as an extension of time to file petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
were filed by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they
did not pursue further said remedies and inasmuch as no restraining order was
issued by the appellate court in the petition for annulment of judgment suit
(CA G.R. No. SP 07107), the auction sale of the levied properties of the
petitioners was held on October 29, 1985 and the Sheriff's Certificate of Sale
was executed on October 30, 1985 in favor of the winning bidder.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on September 23, 1986, when the decision of the respondent
appellate court in CA-G.R. SP No. 07107 was promulgated dismissing the
complaint for annulment of judgment, the auction sale implementing the judgment
sought to be annulled had already been held.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, within the one-year period after the date of the auction sale,
the execution of the Sheriff's Certificate of Sale and the registration thereof
on <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioners never attempted to redeem the auctioned properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="11">November
 17, 1986</st1:date>, the Sheriff executed the Officer's Final Deed of Sale in
favor of the successful bidder and the same was duly registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="3">March
 3, 1987</st1:date>, the <span class="GramE">possession of the sold properties
were</span> delivered to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing the complaint for annulment of judgment, the
respondent appellate court held, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The rule is well settled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A final judgment can be set aside only on grounds of (a) lack of
jurisdiction or lack of due process or (b) that the judgment was obtained by
means of extrinsic or collateral fraud (<span class="SpellE">Gallanosa</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Arcangel</span>, 83 SCRA 676).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The extrinsic or collateral fraud which invalidates a final judgment
‘must be such as prevented the unsuccessful party from fully and fairly
presenting his case or defense; it must be such as prevented the losing party
from having an adversary trial of the issue.' (<span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 87 SCRA 48)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"These grounds are not present in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the court a quo is not
assailed by the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged
errors in the Decision are mere errors of judgment and not errors of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff cannot also
claim that he was prevented from presenting his defense in the court a
quo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not answer the complaint and
was declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal of
his case, he did not file his appellant's brief and resultantly his appeal was
dismissed." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 72)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The questions presented now in this petition are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED
ITS DISCRETION IN NOT ANNULLING THE DECISION OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT AND
THE DEFAULT ORDER, BOTH HAVING BEEN ISSUED IN VIOLATION OF PETITIONERS' RIGHT
TO DUE PROCESS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT GRAVELY
ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN DECLARING THE ROAD <st1:street><st1:address>RIGHT OF
  WAY AGREEMENT FOR NATIONAL ROAD</st1:address></st1:street> VALID DESPITE ITS
DEFECTS IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT GRAVELY
ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN HOLDING THAT <st1:street><st1:address>A PUBLIC ROAD</st1:address></st1:street>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IV<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT GRAVELY
ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN RE-SCHEDULING AND HOLDING THE AUCTION <st1:city><st1:place>SALE</st1:place></st1:city>
WITHOUT REPUBLICATION." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 262)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is notable that from the inception of this case before the
Regional Trial Court up to the time it reached the Court of Appeals in both
instances and then this Court, there was a virtual lack of diligent effort on
the part of petitioners to pursue their defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, there was failure to furnish a copy of
the answer to the plaintiff, respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, there was failure to appear during pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they were declared as in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, instead of seeking relief from the
judgment rendered by default, petitioners filed an ordinary appeal before the
Intermediate Appellate Court which was, however, dismissed for failure to file
appellants' brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A suit for annulment
of judgment was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> but this was dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of the dismissal,
petitioners did nothing, only to awaken when the writ of possession was issued
against them by filing another suit for annulment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, after receiving a copy of the
questioned Court of Appeals' decision on <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1987</st1:date>, petitioners filed a motion for
extension of time to file motion for reconsideration only on <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1986</st1:date>, or exactly
eighteen (18) days from receipt of the copy of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the decision sought to be reviewed had
already became final as early as October 10, 1986 as decisions of any courts
become final after fifteen (15) days from receipt of the copy thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not only was the motion for extension of time filed out of time
but also equally barred by the mandatory injunction in <span class="SpellE">Habaluyas</span>
Enterprises Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Japson</span>, et al., G.R. No. 70895,
August 5, 1985; 138 SCRA 46 against the filing of an extension of time to file
a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition thereafter filed with this Court likewise failed to comply with the
formal requirements as it was filed without a verified statement of material
dates to determine the timeliness of the filing of the petition and of the
payment of the docket and legal research fund fees and lacks proofs of service
to the Court of Appeals and to the adverse party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even after a judicious consideration of the arguments and
counter-arguments of the parties herein on the merits of the case, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that respondent Court of Appeals did not commit any
reversible error in dismissing petitioners' suit filed only on <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1985</st1:date> for annulment of a
judgment dated <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1982</st1:date>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no means whereby the defeated party may procure a final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment to be set aside with a view to
the renewal of the litigation beyond the period for seeking relief from a final
order or judgment under Rule 38, Rules of Court, <u>unless</u> (a) the judgment
is void for want of jurisdiction or for lack of due process of law, or (b) it
has been obtained by fraud (Anuran v. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, 38
Phil. 29; <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Español</span>-­Filipino
v. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, 37 Phil. 921; <span class="SpellE">Garchitorena</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>, 74 Phil. 25; <span class="SpellE">Gallanoza</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Arcangel</span>; L-29300, June 21, 1978, 83 SCRA 676; <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> v. Court of Appeals, L-37317, November 24, 1978,
87 SCRA 48).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioners do not question the jurisdiction
of the court over the parties and the subject matter of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that in petitioners' answer
to the complaint in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">540,</span> they never
questioned the due execution nor the genuineness of the Road Right of Way
Agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They merely claimed in their
answer that they were the rightful possessors of the road that adjoins their
parcels of land, either as riparian owners or as compensation for their land
that has been taken over by the government in constructing the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Miaje?Sigañgi</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an answer, by its nature raises no issue
against the jurisdiction of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now assert <span style="">as
</span>their first ground for allowance of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> that
they <span style="">were </span>denied due process of
law when petitioner <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Ramirez was declared in
default not because he failed to answer but because he had failed to furnish
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Igmedio</span> Reyes <span style="">a copy </span>thereof and because he and his
lawyer had failed to appear at the pre-trial conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that denial of <span style="">due </span>process was not one of the grounds
raised before the respondent Court of Appeals in seeking annulment of the
judgment in Civil Case <span style="">No. </span><span class="GramE">R-540.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
merely assigned three <span style="">(3) </span><span style="">errors </span>below, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) excess of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
in the award of attorney's fees; <span style="">(2) </span>doubtful
genuineness of the Road Right of Way Agreement, and (3) the strip of land is
cadastral road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, none of the
valid grounds prescribed for annulment of a final judgment was alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, at this late stage of the
conflict, cannot validly claim "deprivation of petitioners' right to be
heard." As deprivation of the right to be heard before the trial court was
never raised as an issue in the annulment suit filed before the Court of
Appeals, it cannot be raised as an issue in this petition for review as issues
now are limited to whether the respondent Court of Appeals committed error in
rendering the questioned judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Lumber Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>
Timber Co., Inc., G.R. No. 38685, March 31, 1977, this Court held that since
issues are limited to those presented in the principal pleading, they cannot be
raised on appeal, much more in a mere incidental pleading.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there was no error in the trial court's order declaring
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Ramirez in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure to furnish a copy of the answer
to the adverse party, in itself, is sufficient and valid basis for petitioners'
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The non-appearance of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Ramirez during the scheduled
pre-trial for alleged injury, without presenting a medical certificate or any
proof for that <span class="GramE">injury,</span> is not justified and also a
valid ground for declaration of default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, petitioners' complaint that they were deprived of their right to
be heard is stripped of legal and factual basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the merits of the case, petitioners harped on the alleged
invalidity of the two (2) Road Right of Way Agreements claiming that the strip
of land covered by said agreements is a cadastral road and hence a property
belonging to public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
Provincial Government and/or the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
never questioned the due execution or intrinsic validity of the two agreements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners not being signatories to the documents or for whose
benefits such contracts were executed have no personality to question the
validity thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even under the guise
of pursuing a cause for public interest, petitioners' argument would not merit
a scintilla of belief as their real intent to devote the land in question for
their own use and benefit as an agricultural land is very evident in their
pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioners impugned the validity of the auction sale
without republication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The governing <span class="GramE">rules on notice of sale of real property on execution explicitly
ordains</span> publication in a<span style=""> </span>newspaper
of general circulation once a week within twenty (20) days before the sale
(par. C, Sec. 15, Rule 39, Revised Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that the first scheduled
auction sale on <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1985</st1:date>
have complied with all the requirements imposed by the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The postponement of such sale was due to
petitioners' motion for time to secure injunctive relief from the Intermediate
Appellate Court, which was granted <u><span style="">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></u><span style="">. <span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>Petitioners should not be allowed to
impugn the result of their initiative for several reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the questioned auction sale on <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1985</st1:date> without
republication was never raised as an issue in CA-G.R. No. 07107, the annulment
suit despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objection that the publication <span class="SpellE">preceeding</span> the auction was insufficient cannot be
considered at this stage of the proceeding inasmuch as it was not raised in the
first instance and does not affect the jurisdiction of the court (Ramiro v. <span class="SpellE">Graño</span>, et al. 54 Phil. 744, citing Tan <span class="SpellE">Machan</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Aya</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Trinidad, <span style="">3 </span>Phil.
684; United States v. <span class="SpellE">Inductivo</span>, 40 Phil. 84).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, petitioners are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
or barred from impugning the validity of auction sale without republication
because they filed an extension of time to file a petition for review with the
Intermediate Appellate Court after the denial of their motion for
reconsideration of the trial court's order rescheduling auction sale without
republication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite grant of said
extension, petitioners <span style="">did </span>not
file said petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, such
failure to file the petition is <span class="GramE">an acquiescence</span> to the
validity of the trial court's orders of <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1985</st1:date> and of <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="10">October
 29, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, they
cannot attach reversible error on the said sale after the lapse of more than
one (1) year from the date of the auction sale and after the expiration of the
redemption period; more so, because a final deed of sale in favor of respondent
had already been executed <span style="">in </span>favor
of the private respondent.</p>

petition for review is hereby DENIED and the decision of respondent Court of
