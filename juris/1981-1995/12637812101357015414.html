				<H3>FOSTER PARENTS PLAN INTERNATIONAL/BICOL, DIRECTOR MEREDITH J. RICHARDSON, ATTORNEY ROMULO A. BADILLA AND NELIE WONG, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. HARRIET DEMETRIOU, IN HER CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH XXXVII, 5TH JUDICIAL REGION, IRIGA CITY, AND FRANCIA ZENAIDA SANAO, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>NARVASA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">At issue in this case is the propriety of respondent Regional
Trial Court's assumption of jurisdiction over a disciplinary proceeding being
conducted by a private juridical entity against an employee charged with
serious misconduct on several counts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant events not being in dispute and the parties having,
by their respective pleadings, clearly delineated their basic contentions and
the facts and arguments supportive there­of, this Court has resolved to give
due course to the petition and decide the case without further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Francia</span> <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sanao</span> was first employed
by petitioner Foster Parents International Plan (FPPI) in July 1982 as Donor
Service Coordinator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
subsequently promoted to Social Work Supervisor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 26, 1985, FPPI directed <span class="SpellE">Sanao</span>
to answer disciplinary charges filed against her for (a) dishonesty; (b) gross
and habitual neglect in the performance of duty; (c) lack of respect for
authority; (d) violation of the code of behavior; (e) violation on punctuality;
(f) violation of the code of discipline regarding the preservation of the good
image of the Plan; (g) lack of cre­dibility as supervisor; and (h) lack of
professionalism on the rights of subordinates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1985</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Sanao</span> filed her Answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending investigation of the charges before Atty. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Badilla</span>, FPPI-designated
Hearing Officer, which had been scheduled on various dates, <span class="SpellE">Sanao</span>
filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 1705) for injunction with preliminary
injunction and restraining order with the respondent Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, alleging, among
others, that she was an employee of FPPI; that the charges presented against
her were designed only to provide a color of legality to an otherwise illegal
dismissal, and that in any case, the prosecutor, investigator and judge in the
aforesaid hearing in the person of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Badilla</span>
(FPPI Legal consultant) was one and the same person, in violation of her right
to an impartial judge under the due process clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court issued a res­training
order on <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1985</st1:date>,
"valid for * * twenty (20) days" requiring FPPI, and certain of its
officials <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as co-defendants, to maintain the
status quo and refrain from proceeding with the administrative investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>,
FPPI moved for the dismissal of the aforesaid civil case alleging among others
lack of jurisdiction of the Court over the nature of the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By Order dated January 23, 1986, respondent
Court held in abeyance resolution of the motion to dismiss until after trial on
the merits stating that the grounds relied thereon did not appear to be
indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its Motion for
Reconsideration of this order having been denied on February 26, 1986, FPPI
filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i> alleging that (a) the case
before the lower Court is one involving a labor dispute which is within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Arbi­ters and the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC); and (b) <span class="SpellE">corollarily</span>, the
respondent Court has no authority to issue a restraining order in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, on the other hand, contends (a) that this
case does not fall under either Article 217 (Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the
Commission) or Article 255 (Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Injunc­tion
Prohibited) of the Labor Code; and (b) that in any case, the decisive issue
here is not whether or not an employer has the right to discipline its
employees, but whether it is just for an employer to set up sham and orchestrated
charges against an employee, and to establish a system of administrative
investigation thereon where the judge, prosecutor, and the investigator are one
and the same person in disregard of employee's right to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">What private respondent is saying, at bottom, is that for one
reason or another, her employer wishes to discharge her and to this end, has
conjured up false charges against her and directed the investigation of those
"orchestrated charges" by the employer's own designated official; and
that unless the investigation is restrained and perpetually inhibited, it will
eventuate in her dismissal from employment, without due process, and on sham
charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would in effect preclude by
judicial action the administrative determination by her employer of the
existence of specified grounds for her dismissal from employment, or the
imposition of appropriate sanction, upon the theory that the ostensible grounds
are "orchestrated," and the investigator is biased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact is that if private respondent is indeed ultimate­ly
dismissed from employment, as she fears, her recourse cannot but be to the
Labor Arbiters and the National Labor Relations Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For cases of illegal dismissal are within the
exclusive original jurisdiction of said arbiters and Commission, not the
regular courts of justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, if regular courts of justice have no jurisdiction over cases
of illegal dismissal, it follows that they have no jurisdiction over the
preliminary or antecedent acts or proceed­ings which by design or not, may end
up in illegal dismissals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court's restraining order of <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1985</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was therefore issued without jurisdiction, and will not be sustained by this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither will this Court sustain the theory that courts, or labor
arbiters, may perpetually inhibit administrative investigation by an employer
of charges against an employee which if duly established may justify
disciplinary sanctions, inclusive of dismissal from the service, upon the
employee's plea that the charges are concocted or the investigator is
prejudiced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would result in a
transfer from employers to courts or labor arbiters of the authority to
determine <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>first</u> instance the existence or
non-existence of grounds for administrative penalties against employees, since
it may reasonably be anticipated that every employee will, justifiably or
otherwise, deny the actuality of disciplinary grounds against him, or impugn
the authority of the employer's appointed investigator and/or the <u>bona</u> <u>fides</u>
of the investigator's actuations, and will therefore, not hesitate to file suit
to enjoin the administrative investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a situation not contemplated by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right to dismiss or otherwise impose disciplinary sanctions
upon an employee for just and valid cause, pertains in the first place to the
employer, as well as the authority to de­termine the existence of said cause in
accordance with the norms of due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In the very nature of things, any investigation by the employer of any alleged
cause for disciplinary punishment of an employee will have to be conducted by
the employer himself or his duly designated representative; and the
investigation cannot be thwarted or nullified by arguing that it is the employ­er
who is accuser, prosecutor and judge at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise the absurd would ensue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by entertaining some suspicion of wrong-doing
by an employee and on that account requiring the employee to explain why no
disciplinary sanction should be im­posed on him, the employer would thereby
incapacitate himself from conducting or directing another employee to conduct
an investigation precisely to establish the existence or non-exist­ence of the
alleged wrong-doing; the employer would then have to entrust this function to a
person or persons not employed by or otherwise connected with or related to him
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course the decision of the
employer meting out sanctions against an employee and the evidentiary and
procedural bases thereof <span style="">may </span>subse­quently
be passed upon by the corresponding labor arbiter (and the NLRC on appeal) upon
the filing by the aggrieved employee of the appropriate complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

"to defer or hold in abeyance the resolution or determination of the
defendants' motion to dismiss" ---- which <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span></span> alleged that respondent Court has no

---- said respondent Court acted with grave abuse of discretion, it being this
Court's uniform holding that ?</p>

<blockquote>"* * (While) the court has discretion to defer the hearing if
the ground in the motion to dismiss is not indubitable, * * (yet) a deferment *
* (is) in excess of jurisdiction if the ground for the motion to dismiss were
lack of jurisdiction, or lack of cause of action, for in these events, the
allegations in the complaint are deemed admitted for purposes of the motion to
dismiss so that it can be resolved without waiting for the trial on the
merits."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
