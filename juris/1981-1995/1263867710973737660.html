indispensable.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But before the Court of Appeals could act on petitioner's motion
for reconsideration the following news article attributed to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, counsel of record
of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, appeared in the May 8, 1969
issue of the Manila Times, pages 1 and 22-A thereof:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"A division of the Court of Appeals was denounced by former
Ambassador <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>
yesterday for he said, ‘knowingly abetting the perpetration of a gross and rank
injustice’ on a dissident suspect.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> spoke of the case of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Medina, a Filipino worker who was arrested by
armed forces intelligence officers in <st1:place>Saigon</st1:place> last year
and forcibly flown to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since his arrest last November 23, <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>
has been detained without any criminal case filed in court against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is now at the <span class="SpellE">Arayat</span>
Municipal Jail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The case in the Court of Appeals arose from a petition for
habeas corpus filed by <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> with the Supreme
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The high court had given due
course to the case and made the writ returnable to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Court of First <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Instance. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Detention
Illegal"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The lower court later ruled that <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>'s
detention was illegal since there was no pending criminal case against
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court ordered his immediate
release.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the Solicitor General's
office appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> then filed an urgent motion
before the Court of Appeals for <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>'s
release without posting bail on the basis of the lower court's findings and the
fact that the man is a pauper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> said the Court of Appeals
Fourth Division denied this motion and ordered <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>
post a P5,000.00 bail bond for his provisional liberty.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Reconsideration"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Arguing that <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>'s
detention is illegal, <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> sought the
reconsideration of the Court of Appeals order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General's office opposed this latest motion, and this is
now pending before the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> said in his statement</blockquote>

<blockquote>'It is unthinkable, deplorable<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>and
shocking to see in our midst - in a country which has prided itself as being a
proud example of a vibrant democracy and a firm adherent to the rule of law -
this sad spectacle of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a man </span>kept
illegally for 165 days without any criminal complaint pending against him.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Extremely Dubious”</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> said the appeal of the
Solicitor General was filed under 'extremely dubious circumstances’ because the
notice of appeal was filed even before the copy of the decision of the lower
court was mailed to him."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 9, 1969, the issue of the Manila Times, pages 1 and 14-A,
carried the news item that petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Medina escaped from confinement upon the advice
of his counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contacted by newspaper reporters for comment
thereon, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> issued the following statement
which was published on page 14-A of the Manila Times issue abovementioned:</p>

<blockquote>"I have advised him (<st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>)
to escape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, his detention <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is </span>illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the only way to regain his
freedom."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 10, 1969, the Manila Times issue, on page 1 and 18-A,
carried the news report that Solicitor General Felix V. <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>
and Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Quiroz, counsel for the
respondents, were studying the feasibility <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">of </span>asking the Court of Appeals to cite Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> for contempt and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>instituting disbarment proceedings against him if it was
really true that he advised petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Medina to escape from prison.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1969</st1:date>,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>,
reacting to the proposed action of the Solicitor General, and apparently taking
pride in having advised <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Medina to escape
from jail, issued the following statement:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I am ready and willing to be imprisoned or stripped of my
privilege as a lawyer if the Supreme Court so decrees that my cause is not just
and that I am in error."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the statements attributed to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> as grossly defiant, offensive and derogatory to the
dignity and integrity of the members of the Fourth Division of the Court of
Appeals, the latter required Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> to show
cause why he should not be held liable and dealt with for contempt and
suspended from the practice of law as member of the Philippine Bar (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 35-40).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>
with preliminary injunction was filed with the Supreme Court and docketed as G.
R. No. L-30978 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Medina <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">v. </span>Gen. Manuel T. <span class="SpellE">Yan</span>,

Court of Appeals and all other pertinent orders, and resolutions of said Court
and prohibit it from proceeding further with the case and to compel it to
certify said case to this Court on the ground that it has no jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 47) In a decision
promulgated on September 30, 1974, the Supreme Court denied the petition and
authorized respondent Appellate Court to proceed with the appealed case and all
incidents thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order
dated <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1969</st1:date>
issued by the Supreme Court against the respondent court was lifted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 52)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After remand of the case by the Supreme Court, the Court of
Appeals, promulgated a decision on <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1977</st1:date> in CA - G.R. No. 42658-R reiterating its <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1969</st1:date> resolution requiring
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> to show cause why he should not be held
liable and dealt with contempt and suspended from the practice of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 75).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 22, 1977, petitioner filed a motion to disqualify the
members of the respondent court "on the ground of bias and prejudice and
that they had prejudged the case against him" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 22) which was denied in a resolution dated January 26, 1978 and which again
directed petitioner to show cause why he should not be held liable for contempt
of court and suspended from the practice of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 89-90)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration, filed on <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1978</st1:date> was denied on <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1978</st1:date> on the ground that the
<st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1969</st1:date> resolution of
the former Special Fourth Division was merely a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>findings, not a positive premature
determination of petitioner's guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 93-94)</p>

<p class="BODY">And so, for the second time, this case was elevated to this Court
in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary injunction
on <st1:date year="1978" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1978</st1:date>, docketed as
G.R. No. 48108 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> v. Court of Appeals et al".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Second Division of this Court required
the respondents to file an answer and issued a Temporary Restraining Order,
enjoining respondent court from proceeding with the proceeding for contempt of
court against petitioner in CA- G.R. No. 42658-R, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 115-117)</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties were required to submit their respective
memoranda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents filed their
memorandum on <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1978</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 148) while petitioner filed his memorandum

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not petitioner was
deprived of due process by the resolution of the Court of Appeals in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argued that in ordering him to "show cause why he
should not be dealt with for contempt of court and be suspended from the
practice of law <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">after</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span><u>not</u> <u>before</u>, finding
him guilty of contempt of court and of having violated his lawyer's oath and in
refusing to disqualify themselves from proceeding further, the Court of Appeals
has deprived petitioner of his right to due process of law".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 183) He
further alleged that he has been deprived of his right to a hearing <u>before</u>
being found guilty of contempt of court and of having given ground for
suspension from the practice of law which is in violation of his right to due
process of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 185)</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>the
other hand, pointed out that the disputed resolution of the respondent court
substantially followed a standard form of citations for contempt and that the
questioned resolution of June 21, 1969 is a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> </span>finding as a basis for requiring
petitioner to show cause why he should not be proceeded against for making the
statements attributed to him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the
newspaper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without such findings, there
would be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">no </span>basis for ordering
petitioner to answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">161)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">no </span>question
that the "essence of due process <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is
</span>a hearing before conviction and ‘before an impartial and disinterested
tribunal’” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 173) but due process as a
constitutional precept does not, always and in all situations, require a
trial-type proceeding (<span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> vs. Gonzales, 166
SCRA 316 [1988] citing the ruling in Torres vs. Gonzales, 152 SCRA 272
[1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The essence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of due </span>process is to be found in the
reasonable opportunity to be heard and submit any evidence one may have in
support of one's defense (<span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lamaroza</span>, 110 SCRA 438 [1981] and Richards vs. <span class="SpellE">Asoy</span>, 152 SCRA 45 [1987]). "To be heard" does not
only mean verbal arguments in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">court; </span>one
may be heard also through pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where opportunity to be heard, either through oral arguments or
pleadings, is accorded, there is no denial of procedural due process (Juanita <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Yap </span>Say <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">vs. </span>IAC, G.R. No. 73451, March 28,1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">What the law prohibits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is </span>not
the absence of previous notice but the absolute absence thereof and the lack of
opportunity to be heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lamoroza</span>, 110 SCRA
438 [1981])</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner cannot allege lack of due process since in all the
four (4) questioned resolutions, he was given ample time to explain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">why </span>he should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">not </span>be held in contempt of court and suspended from the practice

freedom from arbitrariness and what it requires is fairness or justice, the
substance rather than the form being paramount (<span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span>
