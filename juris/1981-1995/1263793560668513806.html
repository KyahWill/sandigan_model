petitioners raise in this appeal is -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Whether or not the classification of lands of the public domain by
the Executive Branch of the Government into agricultural, forest or mineral can
be changed or varied by the court depending upon the evidence adduced before
it.” <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(p. </span>9, Brief for the
Petitioners, p. 105, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The antecedent facts of
the case are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On July 11, 1961, four
(4) parcels of land situated </span>in <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>,
Iloilo described in Plan Psu-150727, containing an approximate area of 30.5943
hectares were the subject of an application for registration by Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Diago</span> who alleged among others that she herself occupied
said parcels of land having bought them from the testate estate of the late
Jose Ma. Nava who, in his lifetime, had bought the lands in turn from <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> on <st1:date year="1934" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1934</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Lands opposed said
application on the ground that neither the applicant nor her
predecessors-in-interest have sufficient title over the lands applied for,
which could be registered under the Torrens systems, and that they have never
been in open, continuous and exclusive possession of the said lands for at
least 30 years prior to the filing of the application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Forestry on the other hand
anchored his opposition principally on the ground that certain specific
portions of the lands subject matter of the application, with an area of
approxi­mately 194,080 square meters are mangrove swamps and are within
Timberland Block "B" L.C. Project No. 38, L.C. Map No. 1971 of <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1965</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> Gallo, having purchased the
subject parcels of land from Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Diago</span> on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date>, moved to be
substituted in place of the latter, attaching to his motion an Amended
Application for Registration of Title substantially reproducing the allegations
in the application of Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Diago</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Philippine Fisheries Commission
also moved on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1965</st1:date>
to be substituted in place of petitioner Bureau of Forestry as <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> over a portion of the land sought to be
registered, supervision and control of said portion having been transferred
from the Bureau of Forestry to the Philippine Fisheries Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 6, 1966, the trial court rendered its decision ordering
the registration of the four (4) parcels of land in the name of respondent <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> Gallo after excluding<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>a portion identified as Lot "1-A" which is the site
of the municipal hall of <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> town, and
subjecting Lots Nos. 1, 2 and 3 to the road-of-way of 15 meters width.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed from said decision to the respon­dent Court
of Appeals assigning the following errors in their brief:</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ORDERING THE REGIS­TRATION OF THE <st1:place><st1:placename>SUBJECT</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>LAND</st1:placetype></st1:place> WHICH CONSISTS OF TIMBERLAND,
FORESHORELAND AND LAND BELONGING TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, HENCE UNREGISTERABLE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE POSSESSION OF THE
APPLICANT-APPELLEE AND HIS PREDECESSORS-IN-INTEREST HAD BEEN PEACEFUL, OPEN,
CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED AND ADVERSE TO CLAIMANTS AND IN THE CONCEPT OF
OWNER".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 6, Brief for the
Petitioners, p. 105, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court affirmed said decision and denied a motion for
reconsideration of the same hence the present petition with two (2) assigned
errors, basically the same issues raised with the respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>"RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING
THAT THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A PUBLIC LAND IS AGRI­CULTURAL OR STILL A
FOREST LAND RESTS EXCLUSIVELY UPON THE DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY (NOW DIRECTOR OF
FOREST DEVELOPMENT), THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES) AND THE PRESIDENT OF
THE PHILIPPINES".</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<st1:street><st1:address>RESPONDENT COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE LAND IS PRESUMED TO BELONG TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
AND PRIVATE RESPONDENT HEREIN HAS NOT CONVINCINGLY SHOWN THAT THE REMOTE
PREDECESSOR-IN-INTEREST POSSESSED THE LAND IN QUESTION SINCE TIME
IMMEMORIAL".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 9 &amp; 20, Brief
for the Petitioners, p. 105, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Out of the 30.5943 hectares applied for registration under the
Torrens System, 11.1863 hectares are coconut lands and admittedly within the
disposable portion of the public domain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are more particularly identified as parcels "B",
"B-1", "B-2" and "B-3" of the sketch plan <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "1-A".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rest, consisting of 19.4080 hectares and identified as parcels A,
A-1, A-2 and A-3 of the same plan <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"1-A", is now the center of controversy of the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that respondent court completely ignored the
undisputed facts that 1) the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> area is
within Timberland Block "B",<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>L.C.
Project No. 38, L.C. Map No. 1971 of <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>,
Iloilo and that 2) the certification of February 18, 1956 of the then Director
of Forestry to the effect that the area in question is needed for forest
purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court in affirming
the decision of the Iloilo trial court ruled that although the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> portion of 19.4080 hectares are mangrove and <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> swamps within Timberland Block "B", L.C.
Project No. 38, same cannot be considered part of the public forest not
susceptible of private ownership since petitioners failed to submit convincing
proof that these lands are more valuable for forestry than for agricultural purposes,
and the presumption is that these are agricultural lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court based its conclusion upon
the premise that whether or not a <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> parcel
of land is forest land, is a question of fact which should be settled by
competent proofs, and if such a question be an issue in a land registration
proceeding, it is incumbent upon the Director of Forestry to submit to the
court convincing proofs that the land in dispute is not more valuable for
agriculture than for forest purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is the position of respondent that respondent court did "not hesitate to
apply this presumption with full force particularly where, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>the case at bar, the lands applied
for have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">possessed and cultivated
by the applicant and his predeces­sors-in-interest for a long number of years
without the government taking any positive step to dislodge the occu­pants from
their holdings which have passed from one to another by inheritance or by
purchase".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 9, Brief for private
respondents) Otherwise stated, it is Our impression that private respondents
claim the rule of prescription against the government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Such contentions of private respondents do not hold water.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly the controversial area is within a
tim­berland block or classification of the municipality and certified to by the
Director of Forestry on <st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="2">February 18,
 1956</st1:date> as lands needed for forest purposes and hence they are
portions of the public domain which cannot be the sub­ject of registration
proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly therefore the land
is public land and there is no need for the Director of Forestry to submit to
the court convincing proofs that the land in dispute is not more valuable for
agriculture than for forest purposes, as there was no question of whether the
land is forest land or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be it remembered
that said forest land had been declared and certified as such by the Director
of the Bureau of Forestry on February 18, 1956, several years <u>before</u> the
original applicant of the lands for registration Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Diago</span>,
filed it on July 11, 1961.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of Government of the Philippine Islands vs. <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>,
49 Phil. 49, cited by private respon­dents themselves in their brief, We held -</p>

<blockquote>"Following the decision of <span class="SpellE">Ankon</span> vs.
Govern­ment of the Philippine Islands (40 Phil. 10), it is again held, that
whether a particular parcel of land is more valuable for forestry purposes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">than for agricultural purposes, or vice
versa, is a fact which must be established during the trial of the cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether the particular land is agricultural,
forestry or mineral is a question to be settled in each particular case <u>unless</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Bureau</u> <u>of</u> <u>Forestry</u> <u>has,</u> <u>under</u> <u>the</u>
<u>authority</u> <u>conferred</u> <u>upon</u> <u>it</u> </span><u>by</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">law,</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> <u>prior</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>intervention</u> <u>of</u> <u>private</u>
<u>interest,</u> <u>set</u> <u>aside</u> <u>said</u> <u>land</u> <u>for</u> <u>forestry</u>
<u>or</u> <u>mineral</u> <u>resources</u>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring for emphasis)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We also held in the case
of Republic vs. Animas, 56 SCRA 499, 503 that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As a general rule, timber or forest lands are not
alienable or disposable under either the Constitution of 1935 or the
Constitution of 1973".</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is the Bureau of Forestry that has jurisdiction and
authority over the demarcation, protection, management, reproduction, occupancy
and use of all public forests and forest reserva­tions and over the granting of
licenses for the taking of products <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
including stone <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and earth (Section 1816
of the Revised Administra­tive Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That the area in question is a forest or timber land is clearly
established by the certification made by the Bureau of Forest Deve­lopment that
it is within the portion of the area which was reverted to the category of
forest land, approved by the President </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">March 7, 1958".<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As provided for under
Sec. 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, which was lifted from Act No. 2874, the classification
or reclassification of public lands into alienable or dis­posable, mineral or
forest lands is now a prerogative of the Executive Department of the government
and not of the courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With these rules,
there should be no more room for doubt that it is not the court which
determines the classification of lands of the public domain into agricul­tural,
forest or mineral but the Executive Branch of the Government, through the
Office of the </span>President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">it </span>was grave error and/or abuse <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of discretion for the res­pondent court to
ignore the <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> facts that (1) the disputed
area is within a timberland block and (2) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">as certified to by the then Director of Forestry, the area is needed
for forest purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, private respondents cannot claim to have obtained
their title by prescription inasmuch as the application filed by them
necessarily implied an admission that the portions applied for are part of the
public domain which cannot be acquired by prescription, unless the law expressly
permits it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a rule of law that
possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of forest lands, however
long, cannot ripen into private ownership (Director of Forestry vs. Munoz, 23
SCRA 1184).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
