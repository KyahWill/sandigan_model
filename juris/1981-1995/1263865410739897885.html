<p class="BODY">In 1973, the petitioner became a vice-president and director of
Amalgamated Motors (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.) Inc. (AMPI for brevity)
(p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February 15, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AMPI was then a wholly-owned subsidiary of
British Leyland (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, November 9, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the sole distributor in the
Philippines of British and Japanese heavy equipment, trucks, farm implements,
spare <span style="">parts,</span> <span style="">and </span>other automotive products and
machines manufactured by Leyland International, Land Rover Ltd. (LAND ROVER for
brevity), <span class="SpellE">Avelyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Barfourd</span>,
Mitsubishi, and <span class="SpellE">Furokawa</span> (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
February 15, 1988; p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, November 9, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since 1980, <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> R. Cuevas had been
a dealer of AMPI for government sales.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1981, he bought into the company and became its majority stockholder
and president (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February 15, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon Cuevas' ascendancy in the corporation, <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> was made a director as well as Executive
Vice-President and General Manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
such, he was in charge of the operations of the company and was
"delegated" to <span style="">make </span>sales
of some units and spare parts (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, November 9,
1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As distributor not only of
British but also Japanese automotive products, AMPI carried an inventory of
some P15 to P20 million worth of spare parts of the companies it represented in
the Philippines (p. 37, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, November 9, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1985, LAND ROVER supplied P1.5 million worth of spare parts to
the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) through AMPI, but the merchandise
were returned to AMPI because they were not the correct items needed by the AFP
(p. 27, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February 15, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parts were kept by AMPI pending disposal
instructions from LAND ROVER.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1985</st1:date>,
Erwin <span class="SpellE">Lyndsay</span>, LAND <span class="SpellE">ROVER's</span>

to Amalgamated Motors Philippines this 20% handling charge?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason is this transaction covered a lot
of spare parts and the P143,085.00 was only a part of the entire shipment so
that there is still an amount due to Land Rover Ltd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was requested by Land Rover Ltd. to hold on
to the 20% until a proper account of the other side could be made and proceeds

company" (pp. 6-7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, January 6, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thereupon formed his own outfit which he

the prejudice of the owner thereof, is the essence of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
through misappropriation (Ramirez, 9 Phil. 67).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The words "convert" and "misappropriate" connote an
act of using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own, or of
devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To misappropriate to one's own use includes,
not only conversion to one's personal advantage, but also every attempt to
dispose of the property of another without right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Webber vs. Court of Appeals, 57 OG 2937;
People vs. Panes 37 Phil. 118.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Conversion is an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the
right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another,
resulting in the alteration of their condition or the exclusion of the owner's
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It takes place when a person
actually appropriates the property of another to his own benefit, use, and
enjoyment (<st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> vs. Court of Appeals, 53 OG 731
citing <span class="SpellE">Bouvier's</span> Law Dictionary).</p>

<p class="BODY">The elements of the crime of embezzlement or <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
with abuse of confidence are:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that personal property is received in trust,
on commission, for administration or under any other circumstance involving the
duty to make delivery of or to return the same, even though the obligation is
guaranteed by a bond;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that there is conversion or diversion of such
property by the person who has so received it or a denial on his part that he
received it;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that such conversion, diversion or denial is
to the injury of another, and </blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that there be demand for the return of the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 247, Vol. III, 1988 Ed.,
Revised Penal Code by R.C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first element of the crime does not exist in this case
because <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> did not receive the Leyland Automotive
spare parts from Cuevas or AMPI in trust, on commission, for administration, or
under a duty to make delivery of, or return the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> received the
<st1:place>Leyland</st1:place> spare parts from the <span style="">AFP </span>in trust for LAND ROVER which authorized him <span style="">to </span>sell them ("we now authorize
you to undertake the disposal of the parts at the best possible prices
available from your local market" - <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">1 </span>or F, p. 126, RTC Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> did not convert or divert
the property (he sold them in accordance with the authority given to him by
Land Rover) nor did he deny that he received them, the second element of the
crime was also not present.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">SadduI's</span> failure to deliver the
proceeds of the sale of the spare parts to AMPI or Cuevas did not constitute a
conversion or diversion to the injury of the latter who, not being the owner of
the property, incurred no loss and suffered ho injury o<span style="">n </span>account of <span class="SpellE">Saddul's</span> retention of the
said proceeds while awaiting Land Rover's instructions regarding the special
account where he should deposit them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> simply complied with the directive in Land Rover's <span style="">letter of </span><st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1985</st1:date> that the proceeds be "placed into a separate
client account which will be available to LRPE or any other party authorized by
LRPE" (Exh.1 or F).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Implicit in
this directive was an injunction not to deliver the proceeds to AMPI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third element of the crime <span style="">charged </span>is absent.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth and final element of demand for the return of the
property is also lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AMPI or Cuevas
made no demand for the return of the spare parts sold by <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span>
because Cuevas knew that those spare parts were to be sold for the account of
Land Rover.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that under <span class="SpellE">Lyndsay's</span>
letter of March 4, 1985 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1 or F) AMPI was
entitled to a handling commission of 20% of the sale value of the spare parts
(equivalent to P28,617.00) which <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> failed to
deliver to AMPI, <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> explained that he
subsequently received instructions from Land Rover to hold the 20% commission
until AMPI shall have given an accounting of the remaining Leyland spare parts
(worth P1.2 million) still held by AMPI.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(pp. 10, 23-28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1988</st1:date>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">That testimony of <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span> was not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it was confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Lyndsay's</span> letter dated August 6, 1987 to AMPI or Cuevas (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2) asking for an accounting of "balance of the
parts held by you x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
upon receipt (of which)<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> we will
settle your handling charges at 20% of sales as agreed."</p>

<p class="BODY">By obeying the instructions of Land Rover to withhold payment of <span class="SpellE">AMPI's</span> 20% handling charge (P28,617.00) <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span>
did not become liable for embezzlement to AMPI fork he did not receive that sum
from AMPI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was part of the price he
received from Rover Motor Parts, the buyer of the spare parts.</p>

<blockquote>"Where the accused did not receive
the money from the complainant for safekeeping or on commission or for
administration and in trust, he is not criminally liable for failure to return
the money." (Jose <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> vs. Court of Appeals,
54 OG 1037).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">AMPI’s</span> recourse, in order to recover
its 20% handling charge, is to file a civil action to collect that amount from
its erstwhile principal, Land Rover, not this criminal action for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against <span class="SpellE">Saddul</span>.</p>
