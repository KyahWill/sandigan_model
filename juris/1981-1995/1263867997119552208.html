District Court, and of venue, in an intestate proceeding, are herein raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">Involved is the intestate estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Jamiri</span>
<span class="SpellE">Musa</span>, a Muslim, who passed away on <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="12">31 December 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had six (6) wives, three (3) of whom he
later divorced, and twenty three (23) children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had extensive real and personal properties located in the provinces
of <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span>
WAHIDA <span class="SpellE">Musa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> SALMA
<span class="SpellE">Musa</span>, are among those he divorced, while private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Jahara</span>
ABDURAHIM is one of the three (3) surviving widows. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>RIZAL <span class="SpellE">Musa</span> and
BASSER <span class="SpellE">Musa</span> are two (2) of his sons.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 July 1989, Respondent ABDURAHIM filed <span style="">a </span>"Joint
Petition for the Administration and Settlement of the Intestate Estate of the
Late <span class="SpellE">Jamiri</span> <span class="SpellE">Musa</span> and
Liquidation of Conjugal Partnership," before the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District, with station
at <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City (SDC Spec. Proceedings No. 89-19)
(the Intestate Case).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Court
embraces the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span></st1:placename></st1:place> within its
jurisdiction but not the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Petition averred that the decedent <span class="SpellE">Jamiri</span>
<span class="SpellE">Musa</span>, a resident of <span class="SpellE">Linao</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Upi</span></span>, <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>,
left various properties located in the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>
(184 hectares), <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
(61 hectares), and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental (207
hectares).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Aside from
the settlement of the vast estate, also prayed for was the liquidation of the
conjugal partnership assets of the decedent and ABDURAHIM and the segregation
and turn-over to the latter of her one-half (1/2) share.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appearing <span style="">as </span><span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners WAHIDA and SALMA, the divorced
wives, who also claim to be widows of the deceased; RIZAL, <span class="SpellE">Putih</span>
<span class="SpellE">Musa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Erum</span> <span class="SpellE">Musa</span>, children of WAHIDA with the decedent; and BASSER,
another son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that venue was
improperly laid, and that the properties of the decedent located outside <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span> were beyond the jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Finding the Joint Petition to be sufficient in
form and substance.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Judge issued the Order of Publication on <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="7">11 July 1989</st1:date> and initially set the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="9">18 September 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">All interested parties were duly represented during the hearing
on said date where petitioners, through counsel, manifested their desire to
have the case amicably settled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge "in the interest of peace and harmony among the
heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Jamiri</span> <span class="SpellE">Musa</span>,"
appointed the following as Special Administrators:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ABDURAHIM, for all properties situated in <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>; RIZAL, for all properties situated in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental; and BASSER, for all properties situated in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="10">4 October
 1989</st1:date>, ABDURAHIM, in her "Manifestation and Motion to Cite for
Contempt," accused BASSER, among others, of having allegedly fired upon
the house of her son-in-law in <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span> on <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="9">21 September 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whereupon, on 13 October 1989, an "Opposition to Petition
for Administration and Liquidation of Conjugal Partnership" was filed by
Petitioners, alleging that ABDURAHIM was never legally married to the decedent
and, as such, there was "nothing to support her claim" of having had
a conjugal partnership with the latter; and that venue was improperly
laid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also asked that RIZAL
be issued Letters of Administration instead.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In her Reply, filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="10">25
 October 1989</st1:date>, ABDURAHIM averred that, her marriage to the decedent
was admitted by the latter in various Deeds of Sale he had signed, which were
presented as documentary evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
there was no amicable settlement reached, hearings on the Joint Petition were
conducted, commencing on <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="12">27 December
 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 May 1990, Respondent Judge, issued an Order appointing
ABDURAHIM as Regular <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> upon the finding
that she was legally married to the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners moved for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the interim, Respondent Judge issued an Amended <span class="GramE">Order,</span> dated <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="6">4 June
 1990</st1:date>, incorporating the testimonies of the two (2) other witnesses
presented by Petitioners, which were omitted in the Order, dated <st1:date year="1990" day="16" month="5">16 May 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the appointment of ABDURAHIM as
Regular <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> was maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 August 1990, Petitioners filed a "Motion for
Reconsideration With Motion to Dismiss," raising once again, mainly the
questions of venue and of jurisdiction of the respondent Court over the real
properties of the decedent situated in the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge denied both Motions and upheld the Court's
jurisdiction in his Order, dated <st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="8">22
 August 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
elevation of the instant Petition for Prohibition before this Court seeking to
enjoin respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Corocoy</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Moson</span>, presiding over the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District, from further
taking action on the "Joint Petition."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners take the position that Respondent Judge should have
dismissed the Intestate Case for lack of jurisdiction and for improper
venue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent maintains the
contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule against Petitioners.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pres. Decree No. 1083, otherwise known as the Code of Muslim
Personal Laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
explicitly provides that exclusive original jurisdiction, in matters of settlement
of the estate of deceased Muslims, belong to <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 143.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Original
Jurisdiction</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District Court shall have <u>exclusive</u> <u>original</u>
<u>jurisdiction</u> over:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) All cases
involving disposition, distribution and settlement of the estate of deceased
Muslims, probate of wills, issuance of letters of administration or appointment
of <span style="">administrators or executors
regardless of the nature or the aggregate value of the property." </span>(Chapter
I, Title I, Book IV, par. (b))<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>Emphasis supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the disposition, distribution and settlement of the estate
of <span style="">a </span>deceased Muslim is, in
fact, involved herein, the Joint Petition was correctly filed before the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District.</p>

<p class="BODY">In invoking improper venue, however, petitioners call attention
to the Rules <span style="">of </span>Court mandating
that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Where estate of deceased persons settled</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If the decedent is an inhabitant of the
Philippines at the time of his death, whether a citizen or an alien, his will
shall be proved, or letters of administration granted, and his estate settled,
in the Court of First Instance <u>in the province in which he resides at the
time of his death</u>, and if he is an inhabitant of a foreign country, the
Court of First Instance of any province in which he had estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court first taking cognizance of the
settlement of the estate of a decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to the
exclusion of all other courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
jurisdiction assumed by a court, so far as it depends on the place of residence
of the decedent, or of the location his estate, shall not be contested in a
suit or proceeding, except in an appeal from that court, in the original case,
or when the want of jurisdiction appears on the record." <span class="GramE">(Rule 73).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Underscoring ours).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is then claimed that since the residence of the decedent at
the time of his death <span style="">was </span>actually
<span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City, not <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>, <span style="">as </span>averred by ABDURAHIM, the proceeding <span style="">is </span>beyond the jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari‘a</span> District, and that
venue is more properly laid in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City before the
Regional Trial Court since there are no <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Courts therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it should be recalled that the residence of the
deceased in an estate proceeding is not an element of jurisdiction over the
subject matter but merely of venue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
law of jurisdiction confers upon Courts of First Instance (now Regional Trial
Courts) jurisdiction over all probate cases independently of the place of
residence of the deceased (In the matter of the intestate estate of <span class="SpellE">Kaw</span> <span class="SpellE">Singco</span>, 74 Phil. 239 [1943]).</p>

<p class="BODY">To all appearances, the decedent was a resident of <span class="GramE">both <span class="SpellE">Linao</span></span>, <span class="SpellE">Upi</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>, and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in various Deeds of Sale presented
as evidence by the parties, the decedent alternately stated his place of
residence as <span class="GramE">either <span class="SpellE">Linao</span></span>, <span class="SpellE">Upi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>, which is the
residence of ABDURAHIM, or <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where Petitioners
reside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court held in <span class="SpellE">Uytengsu</span> v. Republic, 95 Phil. 890 (1954), <span style="">"a man can </span>have but one domicile
for one and the same purpose at any time, but he may have numerous places of
residence." Venue, therefore, ordinarily could be at either place of the
decedent's residence, i.e., <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span> or <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
but for the provisions of the Muslim Code vesting exclusive original
jurisdiction, in matters of disposition and settlement of estates of deceased
Muslims, in <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District Courts (<u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioners also contend that the <span class="SpellE">Shari‘a</span>
District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District, presided over
by respondent Judge, has no territorial jurisdiction over properties of the
decedent situated in the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental, citing as
statutory authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the Code of Muslim
Personal Laws, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 138.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Shari'a</u></span><u> judicial districts</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Five special judicial districts, each to
have one <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District Court presided over by one
judge, are constituted as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(e)
The Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District, the Provinces of <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">North <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE"> and Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>, and the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cotabato</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental are not comprised within <span style="">the </span>Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>fact, those provinces are outside the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao created by Republic Act No. 6734, <span class="GramE">its</span>
Organic Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as stated <span style="">in </span>that law, "the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District Court and the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Shari</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">‘a</span> Circuit
Courts created under existing laws shall continue to function <span style="">as </span>provided therein." <span style="">(Art. </span>IX, Sec. 13).</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the same Organic Act explicitly provides:</p>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Except in cases of <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights</u>, the regular courts shall acquire jurisdiction over controversies
involving real property outside the area of autonomy." (Art. <span class="GramE">IX, Section 17 [4]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Underlining ours).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the subject intestate proceeding concerns <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights, coupled with the fact that the
decedent <span style="">was </span>also a resident of
<span class="SpellE">Linao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Upi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>, owning real estate property located in that
province, venue has been properly laid with the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District, which is vested
with territorial jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>,
notwithstanding the location in different provinces of the other real
properties of the decedent.</p>

<p class="BODY">A contrary ruling would only result in multiplicity of suits, to
the detriment of the expeditious settlement of estate proceedings (See Ngo Bun <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sayo</span>, 30 June 1988, 163
SCRA 237 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Besides,
the judgment that may be rendered by the ‘<span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Court, Fifth <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District, may be
executed in other provinces where the rest of the real estate is situated.</span></p>

<blockquote>"When an action covers various parcels of land situated in
different provinces, venue may be laid in the Court of First Instance of any of
said provinces, and the judgment rendered therein may be executed in other
provinces where the rest <span style="">of </span>the
real estate is situated" (National Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Barreto</span>,
52 Phil. 818 [1929]; Monte <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> v. Rodrigo, 56
Phil. 310 [1931]; El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino v. <span class="SpellE">Seva</span>, 57 Phil. 573 [1932]; Bank of P.I. v. Green, 57 Phil.
712 [1932]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Rules of Court likewise provide that the Court first taking
cognizance of the settlement of the estate of a decedent, shall exercise
jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other Courts (Rule 73, sec. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be no impediment to the application
of said Rules as they apply <span class="SpellE">suppletorily</span> to the Code
of Muslim Personal Laws, there being nothing inconsistent with the provisions
of the latter statute (Article 187 of said Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">And while Rule 73 provides that "the jurisdiction assumed by
a court, so far as it depends on the place of residence of the decedent, or of
the location of his estate, shall not be contested in a suit or proceeding
except in an appeal from that court, in the original case, or when the want of
jurisdiction appears on the record," we have taken cognizance of this Petition
for Prohibition considering that the jurisdiction of a <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span>
District Court, a relatively new Court in our judicial system, has been
challenged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Petition for Prohibition is DENIED, and the
case hereby REMANDED to the <span class="SpellE">Shari'a</span> District Court,
