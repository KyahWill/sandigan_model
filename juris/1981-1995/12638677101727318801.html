counterclaim for the recovery of possession of the land on which the said house
of petitioners is located was dismissed in said previous action decided by this

<p class="BODY">Considering the length of time that the case has been pending and
to determine whether supervening events may have rendered the case moot and

respect to lots B-1-A-6-G and B-1-A-6-H for which the corresponding writ of
possession was issued in favor of respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lots B-1-A-6-G and B-1-A-6-H correspond to the area occupied by the
house of petitioners as lessee pursuant to the deed of lease executed between
the parties in 1953 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As mentioned in the decision of this Court in
L-20046 (par. 3, p. 2), it is, however, undisputed that a portion of the land
covered by TCT No. T-4208 indicated in the sketch of the subdivision plan
marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B-1 of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> B was purchased by <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jarabe</span>, late husband of respondent from one <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacatan</span>, who, in turn,
bought the same in 1936 from <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacatan</span>, the original registered owner under OCT No.
251.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent had been in possession
of that portion of the land marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B-1 of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> B continuously,
publicly, peacefully and adversely as owner thereof, from 1938 to the present
which possession is personally known by petitioner and admitted by him in a
deed of lease (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4) to the effect that respondent
had been in possession thereof since 1945.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the same decision (3rd par., p. 4), this Court further<span style=""> </span>said:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the boundaries of the lands that petitioners
<span class="SpellE">Paylago</span> purchased in 1953 and 1954 were well defined,
they must have known that the portion occupied by defendant-respondent under
claim of ownership and leased to them by the latter was included in the
description.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And coupled with their
knowledge that defendant-respondent purchased the same from <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacatan</span>, plaintiffs-petitioners should have inquired
and made an investigation as to the possible defects of the title of the <span class="SpellE">Lacatan</span> <span style="">heirs </span>over
the entire lot sold to them, granting that the latter's certificate of title
was not clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This they failed to
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot now claim complete
ignorance of defendant-respondent's claim over the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was well stated in one case, ‘a purchaser
who has knowledge of facts which should put him upon inquiry and investigation
as to possible defects of the title of the vendor and fails to make such
inquiry and investigation, cannot claim that he is a purchaser in good faith
and had acquired a valid title thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the portion occupied by petitioners, under a
deed of lease and which they continued to occupy forms part of the area of land
indicated as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B-1 of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">B which has been adjudicated

area of the portions of the land adjudicated to respondent consisting of a
total area of 5,392 square meters or a little more than 5,000 square meters
(1/2 hectare) is embraced in Psd-121339, subdivided into five (5) lots, namely
Lot B-1-<span style="">A</span>-6-A, B-1-A-6-B,

<p class="BODY">The Court required respondent in its resolution of May 15, 1974,
to clarify whether or not the house of petitioners which she desired to <span style="">be </span>removed is within the lot and
indicated in the sketch of subdivision plan marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">B-1 of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">B which the Court declared to be owned by her and to the possession

Court on <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1988</st1:date>,
petitioners categorically admitted that their house is within the lot indicated
in the sketch of subdivision plan marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B-1 of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">B

adjudicated ownership of a parcel of land in favor of a party, said court may
