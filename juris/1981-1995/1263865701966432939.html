				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The nature of the work of a "<span class="SpellE">funeraria</span>" supervisor, whether employee or commission
agent, is the issue raised in this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1962, petitioner Cosmopolitan Funeral Homes, Inc.
engaged the services of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> as a "supervisor" to handle the
solicitation of mortuary arrangements, sales, and collections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The funeral services which he sold refer to
the taking of the corpse, embalming, casketing, viewing and delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent was paid on a
commission basis of 3.5% of the amounts actually collected and remitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1987</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> was dismissed by the petitioner for
commission of the following violations despite previous warnings:</p>

<blockquote>“(<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Understatement of the reported contract price against the actual contract price
charged to and paid by the customers;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Misappropriation of
funds or collections by non-remittance of collections and non-issuance of
Official Receipt;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charging <span class="GramE">customers</span> additional amount and pocketing the same for the
cost of medicines, linen, and security services without issuing Official Receipt;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Non-reporting of some
embalming and re-embalming charges and pocketing the same and non-issuance of
Official Receipt;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(e<span class="GramE">)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Engaging</span>
in tomb making and inclusion of the price of the tomb in the package price
without prior knowledge of the customers and the company." (At p. 16,
Records)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> filed a complaint for illegal
dismissal and non-payment of commissions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the parties' position papers, Labor Arbiter
Newton R. <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> rendered a decision declaring <span class="SpellE">Maalat's</span> dismissal illegal and ordering the petitioner to
pay separation pay, commission, interests and attorney's fee in the total
amount of P205<span class="GramE">,571.52</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an appeal from the decision, the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC), on <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1988</st1:date>,
reversed the Arbiter's action and rendered a new decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision dated November
27, 1987, is hereby <u>SET</u> <u>ASIDE</u> and <u>VACATED</u>, and a New One <u>ENTERED</u>,
ordering as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment is hereby
rendered declaring the dismissal of complainant <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> respondent-appellant as justified and with lawful
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of equitable relief and in
the interest of social and compassionate justice, We hereby order and direct
respondent Cosmopolitan Funeral Homes, Inc. to pay complainant <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> his separation pay equivalent to one-half (1/2%)
month average income for every year of service to appellant, computed on his
last year of service immediately preceding his separation from respondent,
subject to allowable set-offs and deductions of the counter-claims of
respondent company, after due notice and hearing.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claims for accrued
commissions by complainant may be admitted, subject to proofs thereof, and
allowable set-offs and deductions credited to the account of respondent-appellant
by way of counter-claims, after d<span style="">ue </span>notice
and hearing.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the evidence adduced
by the <span style="">parties <span class="GramE">are</span>
</span>hereby admitted, subject to rebuttal and/or <span class="SpellE">controvertion</span>
by either party <span style="">during the hearing and
the hearings hereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Attorney's fee in
favor of complainant's counsel is hereby fixed at two (2%) percent, assessable
over whatever final money award complainant may be entitled on the aggregate
sums thereof, after proper hearing on the same.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>All other claims and counter-claims are hereby dismissed for lack
of merit, except those specified above.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally, this case is remanded to the Regional Arbitration Branch
of origin for further proceedings in accordance with the above judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No findings as to costs." (At pp. 66-67,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied, hence,
this petition for review before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in this petition are:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">I. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Whether or not the NLRC erred in ruling that
an employment relationship existed between the parties; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">II.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not there was equitable basis for the
award of 1/2 month separation pay for every year of service.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In determining whether a person who performs work for another is
the latter’s employee or an independent contractor, the prevailing test is the "right
of control" test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this test,
an employer-employee relationship exists where the person for whom the services
are performed <span style="">reserves </span>the right
to control not only the end to be achieved, but also the manner and means to be
used in reaching that end.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues that <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> was
never its employee for he was only a commission agent whose work was not
subject to its control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing <u>Investment</u>
<u>Planning</u> <u>Corporation</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u> <u>v</u>.
<u>Social</u> <u>Security</u> <u>System</u> (21 SCRA 924 [1967]), the petitioner
states that the work of its agents approximates that of an independent
contractor since the agent is not under control by the latter with respect to
the means and methods employed in the performance of the work, but only as to
the results.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC, after its perusal of the facts and evidence on record,
stated that there exists an employment relationship between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner has failed to overcome this
factual finding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the petitioner imposed and applied its rule prohibiting
superiors from engaging in other funeral business which it considered inimical
to company interests proves that it had the right of control and <u>actually</u>
<u>exercised</u> <u>its</u> <u>control</u> over the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span>
worked exclusively for the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the private respondent was prohibited from engaging in
part-time embalming business outside of the company and a violation thereof was
cause for dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incurring absences
without leave was likewise subject to disciplinary action:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a reprimand for the first offense, one week
suspension for the second offense, and dismissal for the third offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner admits that these prohibitive rules bound the
private respondent but states that these rules have no bearing on the means and
methods ordinarily required of a supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The overall picture is one of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner failed to prove that the
contract with private respondent was but a mere agency, which indicates that a
"supervisor" is free to accomplish his work on his own terms and may
engage in other means of livelihood.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Investment</u> <u>Planning</u>
<u>Corporation</u>, <u>supra</u>, cited by the petitioner, the majority of the
"commission agents" are regularly employed elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a circumstance is absent in <span class="SpellE">Maalat's</span> case. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Moreover, the private respondent's job
description states that "xxx he attends to the needs of the clientele and
arranges the kind of casket and funeral services the customers would like to
avail themselves of", and indicates that he must always be on the job or
at least most of the time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the private respondent was not allowed to issue his own
receipts, nor was he allowed to directly deduct his commission as truly
independent salesmen practice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worthy of note too are two other company rules which provide that
"negotiation and making of contract with customers shall be done inside
the office" and "signing of contract should be made immediately
before the cadaver or deceased is place in the casket." (Annex 10-B,
Petitioner's, Position Paper, Records) Said rules belie the petitioner's stand
that it does <span style="">not </span><span style="">have </span>control over the means and
methods by which the work is accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The control test has been satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Social Security System v. Court of Appeals, 156 SCRA 383 [1987])</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding by the public respondent that the petitioner has
reported private respondent to the Social Security System as a covered employee
adds strength to the conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> is an
employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no reversible error in the findings of facts by the NLRC
which are supported by substantial evidence and which we, therefore, do not
disturb on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The payment of compensation by way of commission does not
militate against the conclusion that private respondent was an employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 97 of the Labor Code,
"wage" shall mean "the <span class="SpellE">renumeration</span> of
earnings, however designated, capable of being expressed in terms of money,
whether fixed or ascertained on a time, task, price or <u>commission</u> <u>basis</u>
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">The non-observance of regular office hours does not sufficiently
show that <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> <span class="GramE">is a</span>
"supervisor on commission basis" nor does the same indicate that he
is an independent salesman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
supervisor, although compensated on commission basis, he is exempt from the
observance of normal hours of work for his compensation <span style="">is </span>measured by the number of sales he makes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may not have had the usual fixed time for
starting and ending his work as in other types of employment but he had to<span style=""> </span>spend most of his working hours at his
job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People die at all times of the day
or night.</p>

<p class="BODY">All considered, we rule that private respondent is an employee of
<span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner impugns the award of separation pay equivalent to
one-half (1/2) month average income for every year of service to private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC ruled that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"However, mindful of
the fact the complainant <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span>
has served respondent company for the last twenty four (24) years, more or
less, it is but proper to afford him some equitable relief, consistent with the
recent rulings of the Supreme Court, due to his past services with no known
previous record, and the ends of social and compassionate justice will thus be
served if he is paid a portion of his separation pay, equivalent to one-half
(1/2) month every year of his service to said company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE"><u>Soco</u></span> <u>v</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Merchantile</u></span> <u>Corporation</u> G.R. No.
53364-65, March 16, 1987; and <u>Firestone</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al.</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Lariosa</u></span><u>,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>, G.R. No.
70479, February 27, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not
inclined to grant complainant his full month termination pay for every year of
his service because, unlike in the former <span class="SpellE"><u>Soco</u></span>
<u>case</u>, the misconduct of the employee merely involves infraction of
company rules while in the latter <u>Firestone</u> <u>case</u> it involves
misconduct of a rank-and-file employee, although similarly involving acts of
dishonesty." (At pp. 65-66, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court will not disturb the finding by the NLRC that private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> was dishonest in the discharge of
his functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finding is
sufficiently supported by the evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the private respondent did not appeal from the NLRC
decision, thereby impliedly accepting the validity of his dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We take exception, therefore, to the grant of separation pay to
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Philippine</u> <u>Long</u> <u>Distance</u> <u>Telephone</u>
<u>Company</u> <u>(PLDT</u>) <u>v.</u> <u>NLRC</u>, (164 SCRA 671 [1988]), this
Court re-­examined the doctrine in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> <u>Firestone</u>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Soco</u></span> cases and other previous cases that
employees dismissed for cause are nevertheless entitled to separation pay on
the ground of social and compassionate justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In abandoning this doctrine, the Court held, and we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> We hold that henceforth
separation pay shall be allowed as a measure of social justice only in those
instances where the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious
misconduct or those reflecting on his moral character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the reason for the valid dismissal is,
for example, habitual intoxication or an offense involving moral turpitude,
like theft or illicit sexual relations with a fellow worker, the employer may
not be required to give the dismissed employee separation pay, or financial
assistance, or whatever other name it is called, on the ground of social
justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A contrary rule would, as the petitioner correctly argues,
have the effect of rewarding rather than punishing the erring employee for his
offense x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The policy of social justice is not intended to countenance
wrongdoing simply because it is committed by the underprivileged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At best it may mitigate the penalty but it
certainly will not condone the offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Compassion for the poor is an imperative of every humane society but
only when the recipient is not a rascal claiming an undeserved privilege x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent decisions have abided by this pronouncement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Philippine National Construction
Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, 170 SCRA 207 [1989];
Eastern Paper Mills, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 170 SCRA 597
[1989]; <span class="SpellE">Osias</span> Academy v. National Labor Relations
Commission, G.R. No. 83234, April 18, 1989; and <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span>
Lumber Co., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 54424, August
31, 1989.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Conformably with the above cited <u>PLDT</u> ruling, this Court
pronounces that the grant of separation pay to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Maalat</span>, who was validly terminated for dishonesty, is not
justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it may be mentioned that the Labor Arbiter,
apparently unaware of the petition for review pending before this Court,
conducted further proceedings to compute private respondent's separation pay,
unclaimed commission and 2% attorney's fee, in compliance with the NLRC
decision of <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the Labor Arbiter rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1989</st1:date>,
the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In sum, the sustainable claims of complainant are as follows:</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Maalat</span> his claims above set forth in the total amount
of <u>P117,</u> <u>717.38</u> only."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither party appealed from said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">For being in conflict with our holding that the private
respondent is not entitled to separation pay, this Court sets aside the Labor
Arbiter's computation of separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, we uphold his computation of unclaimed commissions amounting to
P39<span class="GramE">,344.80</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amount of attorney's fee should consequently be recomputed at 2% of P39<span class="GramE">,344.80</span> or P786.89.</p>

Commission is AFFIRMED except for the grant of separation pay which is hereby
