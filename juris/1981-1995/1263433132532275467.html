				<H3>REBECCO E. PANLILIO AND TRINIDAD DIAZ-ENRIQUEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN, SECOND DIVISION, AND PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>NOCON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition questions the
authority of respondent Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) to
investigate and/or reinvestigate ill-gotten wealth cases in view of the
enactment of the Republic Act. No. 6770, otherwise known as the Ombudsman Act
of 1989, and, assuming it has such authority, PCGG's lack of the "cold
neutrality of an impartial judge" in conducting the reinvestigation of
petitioners' case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are as follows:  On August 10, 1989, the PCGG filed with respondent Sandiganbayan an
information against petitioners Rebecco E. Panlilio and Trinidad Diaz-Enriquez
for violation of Section 4 (b) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act,
alleging that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x on or about and during the period from 1974 to 1980,
both dated inclusive, in Ternate, Cavite and Metro Manila, Philippines, and
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused as private<span style=""> </span>individuals and capitalizing or taking
advantage of their close personal relation with ex-President Ferdinand E.
Marcos, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly induce, persuade
or cause then President Ferdinand E. Marcos to violate section 3 (e) of R.A.
3019, by issuing several presidential directives and instructions geared
towards the acquisition and titling of lands with the former U.S. Calumpang
Naval Reservation and other lands adjoining thereof, in Ternate, Cavite, to
form part of Puerto Azul complex, a property controlled and operated by the
accused and causing the use of government funds, personnel and equipment in the
constructions of internal road network and bridges within the said Puerto Azul
complex, thereby giving to its owner/owners unwarranted benefits and advantage
through manifest partiality and evident bad faith, to the damage and prejudice
of the government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 13784.</p>

<p class="BODY">After posting bail, petitioners filed a motion to quash the
information on the grounds that (1) the facts charged do not constitute an
offense:  (2) respondent court has no
jurisdiction over the persons of the accused, nor over the offense charged; (3)
the preliminary investigation of PCGG I.S. No. 056 has not been terminated, and
(4) the PCGG had no authority to file the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 2, 1989, the PCGG opposed the motion to quash.  On November 8, 1989, petitioners filed a
"Comment [on Opposition] and Supplement to Motion to Quash",
requesting that the motion to quash be considered as and/or converted into a
motion for reinvestigation, and praying that the Sandiganbayan order the PCGG
to reinvestigate case in order that they may submit controverting affidavits
and evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution promulgated on November 29, 1989, the
Sandiganbayan denied petitioners' motion to quash but granted their prayer for
reinvestigation, ordering (1) the PCGG to conduct the reinvestigation, (2)
allow petitioners to submit their counter-affidavits and supporting evidence
within a reasonable period under the circumstances, and (3) submit the proper
resolution and/or manifestation as to the results thereof on January 4,
1990.  The arraignment of petitioners
scheduled on December 8, 1989 was reset to January 4, 1990 in the event of an
adverse resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the aforementioned resolution, the PCGG served
on petitioners the Order dated December 14, 1989 directing them to submit their
respective counter-affidavits and supporting evidence to Prosecutor Gregorio S.
Daproza on December 28, 1989 at 2:00 p.m., after which, the case would be
deemed submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 26, 1989, petitioners filed with the PCGG a
"Motion for Extension of Time to Submit Counter-Affidavit" on several
grounds, among which, petitioners would seek a clarification from the
Sandiganbayan as to whether the PCGG had jurisdiction to reinvestigate the case
in view of the enactment of Republic Act No. 6770, otherwise known as the
Ombudsman Act of 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 2, 1990, petitioners filed a "Motion for
Clarification" with the Sandiganbayan seeking to determine whether the
PCGG had the jurisdiction to reinvestigate their case.  In an Order dated January 4, 1990, the
Sandiganbayan held that the PCGG retained the jurisdiction to file and
prosecute the instant case, there being no showing that the Ombudsman had
indicated its authority to take over the prosecution of the same pursuant to
Section 15 (1) of the Ombudsman Act of 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated January 9, 1990, petitioner Panlilio requested
the Office of the Ombudsman to conduct the reinvestigation of Criminal Case No.
13784 pursuant to Section 15 (1) of the Ombudsman Act.  In its reply dated January 19, 1990, the
Ombudsman denied the request, stating that the exercise of its authority over
the aforementioned case is inappropriate.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 15, 1990, petitioners moved for the reconsideration
of the Sandiganbayan Order dated January 4, 1990.  During the hearing on petitioners' motion, the PCGG did not
appear but asked time to react to the motion.  On February 20, 1990, petitioners received a copy of PCGG's Order dated
February 19, 1990 holding that for failure of petitioners to file their
respective counter-affidavits, the reinvestigation of the case is deemed
terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the scheduled arraignment of petitioners on February 22,
1990, they were served in open court a copy of the Sandiganbayan's resolution
dated February 21, 1990 denying their motion for reconsideration.  Petitioners then requested for an
opportunity to elevate the matter to the Supreme Court and/or to refile their
motion to quash.  The Sandiganbayan
denied the request and ordered the arraignment of the petitioner Panlilio.  Petitioner Panlilio refused to enter a plea,
thus the Sandiganbayan ordered a plea of "not guilty" be entered into
the record in his behalf.  As to
petitioner Enriquez, who was sick at the time, her arraignment was rescheduled
to March 7, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 6, 1990, petitioners filed the instant petition,
averring that (1) the Ombudsman, and not the PCGG, has the primary jurisdiction
to reinvestigate Criminal Case No. 13784; (2) PCGG does not possess "the
cold neutrality of an impartial judge" and is incompetent in proceeding
with the reinvestigation; and (3) petitioners did not waive their right to
reinvestigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners were, however, mistaken when they claim the
incompetency of the PCGG to investigate their case in view of the primary
jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to investigate hidden wealth cases.  While Section 15 (1) of Republic Act No.
6770 gave the Ombudsman the primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the
Sandiganbayan it did not specifically revoke the PCGG's power of
investigation.  In <i>Cojuangco, Jr. vs.
Presidential Commission on Good Government,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
We held that said provision merely gave the Ombudsman <i>concurrent</i> authority
to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees with similarly
authorized agencies of the government, such as the PCGG, with the qualification
that the Ombudsman may take over at any stage of such investigation in the
exercise of its primary jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The authority of the PCGG to conduct preliminary investigation in
ill-gotten wealth cases is provided for in Sections 2 (b) and 3 (a) Executive
Order No. 1 and Sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order No. 14.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In <i>Cojuangco, supra,</i> We have held that these provisions grant the PCGG -?</p>

<blockquote>"x x x the power to investigate and
prosecute such ill-gotten wealth cases of the former President, his relatives
and associates, and graft and corruption cases that may be assigned by the
President to the PCGG to be filed with the Sandiganbayan.  No doubt, the authority to investigate
extended to the PCGG includes the authority to conduct a preliminary
investigation."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We also noted in the aforementioned case that under Section 15
(11) of Republic Act No. 6770, the Ombudsman was vested only with the power to
investigate and to initiate the proper action for the recovery of ill-gotten
wealth and/or unexplained wealth amassed <i>after</i> February 25, 1986 and the
prosecution of the parties therein, thereby implicitly maintaining the
authority of the PCGG to conduct preliminary investigation of ill-gotten wealth
and/or unexplained wealth amassed <i>before</i> February 25, 1986.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This does not mean, however, that the Ombudsman does not have
primary jurisdiction over ill-gotten wealth and/or unexplained wealth amassed <i>before</i>
February 25, 1986.  It has, and We
reiterate Our ruling in <i>Cojuangco,</i> that despite Section 15 (11) of
Republic Act No. 6770, the Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction to investigate
such cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The Ombudsman, however, may decline in exercising its primary jurisdiction, as
in the case at bar, thereby leaving the concurrent government agency concerned,
the PCGG, the task of conducting the preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the issue of whether PCGG possessed the "cold
neutrality of an impartial judge," We find for the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioners that it is impossible for the PCGG
to possess the cold neutrality<span style=""> </span>of
an impartial judge in conducting the preliminary<span style="font-size: 11pt;">
</span>investigation of I.S. No. 056 when the PCGG itself gathered the evidence
in said case and filed the complaint against petitioners.  It cannot both be a prosecutor and a judge
at the same time.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the PCGG has already shown a marked bias against
petitioners when it abruptly terminated the preliminary investigation and resolved
the case against them without even notifying petitioners of its adverse
resolution, thereby preventing petitioners from filing a motion for
reconsideration or moving that they be given additional time to file
counter-affidavits and supporting evidence.  This is the primary reason why the Sandiganbayan granted the
petitioners' request for the reinvestigation of the case against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, to ensure a just and fair administration of justice,
the PCGG should be disqualified from conducting a reinvestigation of PCGG I.S.
No. 056 and should transmit the records of the same to the Ombudsman.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of whether petitioners had waived their right to a
preliminary investigation, We likewise find for the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan erred in considering that the petitioners have
waived their right to a preliminary investigation for their failure to submit
their counter-affidavits on December 28, 1989.  Petitioners' failure to submit their counter-affidavits was because of
the pendency of their "Motion for Clarification" with the
Sandiganbayan at the time.  When said
motion was denied by the Sandiganbayan in its Order dated January 4, 1990, the
petitioners went directly to the Ombudsman to ask for its intervention.  It was only when the Ombudsman declined, did
the petitioners seek a reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan's Order of January
4, 1990.  During all this time,
petitioners repeatedly told the PCGG Prosecutor that they would submit their
counter-affidavits and supporting evidence once the issue of the Ombudsman's
jurisdiction over the case had been determined with finality.  Clearly, there is no waiver of petitioners'
right to a preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.  The preliminary investigation conducted by
the PCGG, including the information filed in Criminal Case No. 13784, are
hereby declared null and void.  The PCGG
is ordered to transmit the records of PCGG I.S. No. 056 to the Ombudsman for
appropriate action.  Cost <i>de officio</i>.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the conclusion that although Section 15(1) of R.A.
No. 6770 gives the Ombudsman primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan,
it does not revoke the PCGG's power of investigation.  The Ombudsman may, however, take over at any stage of such
investigation in the exercise of such primary jurisdiction; it may likewise
decline to exercise it and leave the investigation to the PCGG.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the Office of the Ombudsman denied
petitioner's request of 9 January 1990 for it to conduct a reinvestigation of
Criminal Case No. 13784 pursuant to the aforesaid Section 15 (1) of R.A. No.
6770.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot, however, join the majority in its view that the PCGG
should be divested of its power to conduct the reinvestigation because it does
not possess "the cold neutrality of an impartial judge." The opinion
in <i>Cojuangco, Jr. vs. PCGG </i>(190 SCRA 226) cannot be relied upon.  In that case, petitioner Cojuangco succeeded
in demonstrating that the criminal cases involve transactions covered by Civil
Case No. 0033 which the PCGG filed on 31 July 1987 against him and others.  It further appears that in connection with
said case, the PCGG, "as law enforcer, gathered evidence as to the alleged
ill-gotten wealth of petitioner and intervenors and, after satisfying itself
that there is a <i>prima facie </i>case, sequestered and issued a freeze order
for all the properties of petitioner."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was upon these facts that this Court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court cannot close its eyes to the glaring fact that in
earlier instances, the PCGG had already found a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case
against the petitioner and intervenors when, acting like a judge, it caused the
sequestration of the properties and the issuance of the freeze order of the
properties of petitioner.  Thereafter,
acting as a law enforcer, in collaboration with the Solicitor General, the PCGG
gathered the evidence and upon finding cogent basis therefor filed the aforestated
civil complaint.  Consequently the
Solicitor General filed a series of criminal complaints.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is difficult to imagine how in the conduct of such preliminary
investigation the PCGG could even make a turn about and take a position
contradictory to its earlier findings of a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case
against petitioner and intervenors.  This was demonstrated in the undue haste with which I.S. Nos. 74 and 75
was (sic) investigated and the informations were filed in court even as the
petitioner and intervenors questioned its authority, invoked the denial of due
process and promptly informed the PCGG of the filing of this petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In our criminal justice system, the law enforcer who conducted the
criminal investigation, gathered the evidence and thereafter filed the
complaint for the purpose of preliminary investigation cannot be allowed to
conduct the preliminary investigation of his own complaint.  It is to say the least arbitrary and unjust.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is in such instances that We say one cannot be a prosecutor and ‘a
prosecutor and a judge at the same time.’ Having gathered the evidence and
filed the complaint as a law enforcer, he cannot be expected to handle with
impartiality the preliminary investigation of his own complaint, this time as a
public prosecutor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The circumstances of the instant petition are even worse.  To repeat, the PCGG and the Solicitor
General finding a <i>prima facie </i>basis filed a civil complaint against
petitioner and intervenors alleging substantially the same illegal or criminal
acts subject of the subsequent criminal complaints the Solicitor General filed
with the PCGG for preliminary investigation.  While ostensibly, it is only the Solicitor General who is the
complainant in the criminal cases filed with the PCGG, in reality the PCGG is
an unidentified co-complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, when the PCGG issued the sequestration and freeze orders
against petitioner's properties, it was on the basis of a <i>prima facie </i>finding
that the same were ill-gotten and/or were acquired in relation to the illegal
disposition of coconut levy funds.  Thus, the Court finds that the PCGG cannot possibly conduct the
preliminary investigation of said criminal complaints with the ‘cold neutrality
of an impartial judge,’ as it has prejudged the matter.  Add to this the fact that there are many
suits filed by petitioner and the intervenors against the PCGG and vice
versa."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similar or at least substantially similar facts have not been
shown to exist in this case.  Neither
can a conclusion of bias on the part of the PCGG be drawn from the fact that it
or red the termination of the investigation for, to my mind, petitioners
resorted to all possible but patently unnecessary legal maneuvers to delay the
proceedings, such as:  (a) the filing of
a motion for clarification with the Sandiganbayan seeking the determination of
whether the PCGG had the jurisdiction to investigate the case, despite the
Sandiganbayan's unequivocal Resolution of 29 November 1989 directing the PCGG
to conduct the reinvestigation and allowing petitioners to submit their
counter-affidavits and supporting evidence before the PCGG, (b) the sending of
a letter to the Ombudsman requiring it to conduct the reinvestigation despite
the equally unequivocal Order of 4 January 1990 of the Sandiganbayan holding
that the PCGG retained its jurisdiction to file and prosecute the case and (c)
the filing of a motion to reconsider the said order.  The PCGG merely performed its duty.  It should not be faulted for frustrating attempts to further
delay the preliminary investigation of the case.  The performance of its official duty<span style="font-size: 7pt;">
</span>enjoys the presumption of regularity.  Only clear and convincing evidence to the contrary -- not mere
speculation or self?serving conclusions, as in this case -- can rebut it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, I vote to deny the petition.<span style="font-size: 20pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
